[0:48:12] Megaket: Oh you can press R to do the bounce stuff
[0:48:18] Trent7004: Looks like a fall guys map, or a Fortnite event
[0:48:23] mushi_buns: try the drift button when in the air?
[0:48:44] ChessCatUWU: When you drift, you bounce before, and it can be registered as a trick.

[0:53:29] ChessCatUWU: Since we're talking about tricks and stuff, do you know about braking while drifting?
[0:53:45] Megaket: Yeah and when you're at the top you basically only get defensive items/coins
[0:53:47] mushi_buns: hehe
[0:53:51] supra_mike: I remember "drifting" irl in highschool a friend of mine had his mom's VW beetle and we would have like 6 people in it, put the parking brake on with plastic lunch trays under the rear wheels
