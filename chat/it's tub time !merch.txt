[1:55:22] bep256: sadly i am a weirdo...
[1:55:30] Returner7: yeah... but I think at a certain point, if a newbie want more interaction they need to interact more, and I think we do a decent job of being welcoming
[1:55:38] demon_dandy: Im biased but ashton chat is fun and healthy imo ashton51Tensai
[1:55:47] Returner7: @bep256 we're all weirdos
[1:55:49] anonsama9001: literally me
[1:56:05] flickmannss: "but i'm a creep..."
[1:56:13] JTBun: nah
[1:56:18] JTBun: i mean yeah
[1:56:21] JTBun: I guess
[1:56:40] JTBun: but chat interactivity can also lead to being very enjoyable for everyone
[1:56:48] JTBun: not just the peopel chatting
[1:56:48] Senoquese: i think the way you handle chat is really wonderful and welcoming, something that makes you unique and stand out
[1:56:49] rikkaonline: i think just talking to individuals is ok, its if you like reference in jokes without background too much that would be bad
[1:56:55] demon_dandy: I get ya but it can also lead to people wanting to join in more
[1:57:02] rikkaonline: but you always explain references you make so its ok
[1:57:06] bep256: bathtub radiohead
[1:57:08] Returner7: huh... I guess, but the chat is part of the streaming experience, and you thank lurkers pretty often ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:57:08] Navy_Mongoose: I'M A CWEEP
[1:57:18] flickmannss: nice vibe tho ashton51Smile
[1:57:57] demon_dandy: Like they seno getting shamoned and they wanna join in right.
[1:57:59] JTBun: you can do that
[1:58:03] Returner7: you could
[1:58:14] Returner7: LMAO who laughed at that suggestion ?
[1:58:15] Senoquese: what about a prerecorded stream
[1:58:32] rikkaonline: i dont think that would be a problem lol
[1:58:38] demon_dandy: The ashton rakugo ashton51Tensai
[1:58:49] Returner7: LOL cake getting called out
[1:59:11] bep256: emote only mode stream
[1:59:15] Senoquese: it could work on story focused games
[1:59:19] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:59:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:59:29] Senoquese: as long as you dont get stuck and then need pitcrew to help you...
[1:59:30] Returner7: hold up the concert was pretty cool, and that was like an hour of you not looking at chat!
[1:59:31] Navy_Mongoose: PURPLE SQUAD UNITE
[1:59:31] T33bags: this is like a Socratic seminar but half of us belong in the psych ward
[1:59:40] TheAsterite: i shall be forgotten mopSteer
[1:59:48] demon_dandy: Some people have it on random but i like purp
[2:00:18] JTBun: jerma is like one of the very few big streamers that actually reads chats regularly
[2:00:23] mrvacbob: the trick is to read it once in a while and get one guy'd for an hour
[2:00:24] horribleham: Ashton is very interactive and it's fun! Whatever works for her!
[2:00:27] Senoquese: you could practice on games that have more dialogue so you always have something to bounce off of
[2:00:27] T33bags: the only big streamer that is insane enough to actually read their chat is hasan and its like self harm to do that
[2:00:39] demon_dandy: ig but even some big streamers really read their chat and riff off that
[2:00:44] Returner7: weird, I feel like the one Niji vtuber I follow actually does a decent amount of reading chat comments
[2:00:50] JTBun: jerma reads chat
[2:00:58] ReyJaggy: Gura relies on chat a lot
[2:01:17] Navy_Mongoose: good streamers read their chat, there's not much point of being a streamer if you ignore the chat
[2:01:34] JTBun: ofc you do ashton51Love
[2:01:47] T33bags: average chinchilla attention span what is it
[2:01:48] Returner7: yeah 100% true, i say don't worry about it until it becomes a problem for you, but I think you got it in you! ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[2:01:54] ReyJaggy: Youre cute the heck!
[2:01:59] demon_dandy: Everyone will be different imo ashton51Tehe its not a crutch to have an accord with chat, just another flavor
[2:02:22] rikkaonline: i think for the 80% of people that are lurkers, either way is the same
[2:02:26] Returner7: also the Ashton Soup is officially 2 hours LMAO!
[2:02:30] bep256: i watch a big streamer who knows chat members

[2:04:12] Returner7: oh yeah, it is very hardware dependent
[2:04:13] mrvacbob: yeah you can't talk if you hear yourself on delay

[2:04:26] Senoquese: everytime i try to test my mic, i cant even do it properly cuz i just start stuttering and stop myself
[2:04:29] WhompingWalrus: Windows lets you listen in real time.
[2:04:30] ninoegyn: otherwise i sound like i’m underwater
[2:04:30] demon_dandy: BRUH that cwnt be common
[2:04:41] T33bags: used to have a pair of headphones like in 2012 that did that

[2:05:10] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:05:18] mrvacbob: it's like her job
[2:05:21] WhompingWalrus: Windows sound card panel -> "recording" tab -> right-click your mic -> properties -> "listen" tab -> "listen to this device" -> "OK"
[2:05:26] T33bags: @ninoegyn be linkedin for ashton
[2:05:32] Senoquese: on windows it still has a few ms of delay atleast for me
[2:05:37] Senoquese: and its enough to fuck me up from talking
[2:05:46] WhompingWalrus: @Senoquese Ah weird mine's instant
