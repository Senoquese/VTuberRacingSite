[0:14:36] hajijo: I wanted to make an itasha for you, but sadly, it requires hacking to do it well and I don't wanna get banned. :(
[0:15:02] Darkhollow360: Doesn’t require hacking…
[0:15:08] sirenity_spl: modding?
[0:15:22] Darkhollow360: U can do it legit with skills
[0:15:34] hajijo: @Darkhollow360 I do not have those skills, alas. Lol

[0:21:02] ajvark: burnout is 2000s modern
[0:21:03] NewerDCD: Burnout is cars, Wipeout is sci-fi like F-Zero
[0:21:18] sirenity_spl: burnout revenge is just pure destruction
[0:21:39] CINO_p: i wonder if driving a car at 140 kmh is this difficult
[0:21:42] ajvark: now Burnwipes
[0:21:49] ajvark: burnwipes are when you go too hard with toilet paper
[0:22:03] smoreeater: Ashton wrecking her whip tobsPANIK
[0:22:14] HashiriyaR32: don't feel bad, I"m kinda pinballing back and forth on orange plastic track in the really fast cars because I'm getting disorientated as all heck
[0:22:15] phatscout: burnout is a game where you drive cars and blow shit up and also listen to mall emo

[0:24:18] HashiriyaR32: That's co-op
[0:24:22] phatscout: can yo do co-op yet?
[0:24:28] HashiriyaR32: You, 5 other players, vs team of 6 drivatars
[0:25:14] HashiriyaR32: The Trial is that, but the drivatars are on UNBEATABLE difficulty
[0:25:23] HungryHonk: there's a part of the weekly events where you have to win a co-op mission -- yeah, the trial
[0:25:27] HashiriyaR32: I think on Tour, they're only highly skilled
[0:25:58] HungryHonk: the trial is very very painful as someone who just wants to get the rewards
[0:26:25] HashiriyaR32: I had that same fear when I picked up Horizon 4 again in early 2020 (just before lockdowns) after I dropped it a month after launch.
[0:26:29] HungryHonk: you only have to beat the trial once so of course you'll be matched with people who are bad enough that they haven't beaten it yet
[0:26:36] demon_dandy: !lurk i gotta cook but im listenin
[0:26:36] StreamElements: demon_dandy is a sneaky squeaky lurky mouse!
[0:27:13] HungryHonk: I usually get out in front and slow down the AI cars in the trial but sometimes I'll have co-op friends who still lose against ai I'm blocking
[0:27:22] Darkhollow360: ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[0:27:23] phatscout: did they fix arcade yet?
[0:28:00] phatscout: i remember arcade being super busted compared to FH4 when I played around launch and then never bothered trying it again after that
[0:28:06] phatscout: oh shit you got an s2000
[0:28:44] hajijo: This track is real fuin!
[0:28:51] jcall__: hillclimb time
[0:29:10] HashiriyaR32: Don't know about Arcade, I've stopped doing it because I'm only aiming for 20 points per season for the new car.  Already got the achievement for completing everything in one Series a few months back.
[0:29:45] hajijo: TIme to commit totally fair passes jimmyb3Creep
[0:30:51] HashiriyaR32: chase those pugs down
[0:31:09] HungryHonk: have you watched any of hoonigan's youtube videos? their gymkhana series is pretty impressive
[0:31:40] HungryHonk: recently the series was handed over to my favourite driver of all time, travis pastrana
[0:31:41] hajijo: Go go go!
[0:31:55] HungryHonk: it's stunt driving
[0:31:59] HungryHonk: they also do rally racing sometimes
[0:32:01] phatscout: ken block's car influencer brand
[0:32:21] hajijo: Nice overtake!
[0:32:56] HungryHonk: travis pastrana himself has also done EVERY motorsport, everything involving bikes and also monster trucks and rally and nascar
[0:33:33] HungryHonk: he was the first guy to do a double backflip on a motocross bike
[0:33:45] phatscout: I remember those original gymkhana vids being huge when i was in high school and I didn't give a rats ass about cars back then
[0:34:16] phatscout: (this was circa 2010)
[0:34:24] tetelande: lol
[0:34:28] hajijo: Wait WHAT
[0:34:30] HashiriyaR32: pfffffffffffffffft
[0:34:54] hajijo: oh lordy
[0:35:14] hajijo: I couldn't imagine what that would begin to sound like lol
[0:35:18] tetelande: Tbh F1 only really getting bigger in the USA in the recent years
[0:35:37] phatscout: yeah nobody I hung out with was really into car stuff back then and even then they were like "dude holy shit this is crazy"
[0:35:43] Darkhollow360: Yeah Captain Falcon
[0:36:28] HungryHonk: yeah this game is weird about barriers
[0:36:29] hajijo: Those barriers would NOT pass FIA certification for a race lol
[0:36:50] phatscout: @HungryHonk pastrana still being at it today is crazy imo. that mt washington hillclimb was mad
[0:37:17] hajijo: ooo we're close to the barn find
[0:37:32] PastaThief911: if you crash ill give you 2 bits
[0:37:33] phatscout: do you have the drone yet?
[0:37:40] HungryHonk: btw the barriers and stuff are like that so you can use them to get points and combos, can be a good habit to keep your combo up so you get more rewards over time
[0:37:44] phatscout: the drone is a huge help with the barn finds
[0:37:52] demon_dandy: i remember when i was a kid, f1, dirt rally, and some other races would come on before cartoons so id watch em there
[0:37:58] PastaThief911: Cheer1 Cheer1
[0:38:12] PastaThief911: you crashed into the fence so its counts for me
[0:38:48] hajijo: Roads are merely suggestions here
[0:38:50] PastaThief911: If you jump off the edge of the mountain it's 10 bits
[0:39:30] phatscout: it's somewhere in the big purple circle aera
[0:39:43] phatscout: (this is why the drone is super helpful)
[0:39:50] Darkhollow360: It’s hidden within that circle
[0:40:02] HashiriyaR32: Under Creative Hub
[0:40:16] HungryHonk: in previous games the barn would always be visible from a road but that isn't a rule anymore
[0:40:20] CINO_p: jumping off the cliff ashton51Pog
[0:41:15] HashiriyaR32: Speeeeeeeeeeen

[0:41:41] HungryHonk: chat can tell you if you get tired of searching but i can say it probably isn't built on a 45 degree cliff side
[0:41:55] CINO_p: id shit my pants if my car was spinning down the side of a mountain
[0:42:27] hajijo: This thing has gorilla grip

[0:43:36] hajijo: You get to fix it up!
[0:43:36] sirenity_spl: its totally usable
[0:43:48] scratchingway: oh forza! i got busy working on a jigsaw puzzle lmao…
[0:43:58] HashiriyaR32: you don't have to
[0:44:06] HungryHonk: put the corvette in, it drops really often
[0:44:19] HungryHonk: that ones easy to get back too yeye
[0:44:28] hajijo: Aww this is a cute feature!
[0:44:30] Darkhollow360: U don’t have to gift
[0:44:49] Biscuit_TMGS: Are you playing with chat?
[0:45:04] hajijo: I like to imagine that they just strap a balloon to the car and drop it somewhere lol
[0:45:12] PastaThief911: I bought a HUGE 3 liter of grape soda from the grocery store for 94 cents. best deal in the entire store
[0:45:17] Darkhollow360: Open all ur rewards

[0:45:41] hajijo: I felt that landing in my soul
[0:45:56] scratchingway: 3L bottles are wild, i love them
[0:45:57] HungryHonk: oh yeah that opening sequence with the planes was a reference to the tv ads for motorstorm 2, the first 2 games in that series inspired some of the map design
[0:45:58] CINO_p: *zooming down the mountain* "OH NO"
[0:45:59] smoreeater: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[0:46:44] demon_dandy: 100s of years old, 10ft historical cactii VS ashton51Steer
[0:46:47] HungryHonk: they were very cool commercials, i remember being super hyped as a kid who loved the first motorstorm game
[0:47:29] scratchingway: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[0:47:42] hajijo: 10/10, no notes!
[0:48:02] demon_dandy: what was the racing game with the crazy moments you could activate mid race
[0:48:06] HashiriyaR32: Super7
[0:48:16] phatscout: split/second
[0:48:17] phatscout: ?
[0:48:20] demon_dandy: yeaaaa
[0:48:20] HashiriyaR32: Split/Second @demon_dandy
[0:48:25] hajijo: Yeah, there are SOOOOO many lol
[0:48:32] demon_dandy: that was rad as hell
[0:48:44] hajijo: You could do months of content based off racing games alone
[0:49:00] scratchingway: people love to go fast
[0:49:10] HashiriyaR32: 400 feet more
[0:49:16] HashiriyaR32: You need to back up first then go
[0:49:20] hajijo: Looks like the target was 1100ish feet lol
[0:49:36] demon_dandy: all racing games will be obsolete sadly when bloodborne kart drops
[0:49:43] HungryHonk: unfortunately all the racing games i like are old now and i dont like how modern ones are being made (plus way less of them are being made)
[0:49:47] HungryHonk: that's why im making my own racing game though
[0:49:49] hajijo: @demon_dandy piapiuWheeze piapiuWheeze piapiuWheeze
[0:49:54] PastaThief911: were you playing hot wheels unleashed online with viewers?
[0:50:13] demon_dandy: so close!
[0:50:26] HungryHonk: hw unleashed is the new game, it's pretty good
[0:50:33] hajijo: piapiuRave piapiuRave piapiuRave piapiuRave
[0:50:36] demon_dandy: bangerrrr
[0:50:42] HungryHonk: it has stock music in the main menu that a youtuber i watch uses and it's really funny to me
[0:51:04] HashiriyaR32: Also beware the timer.  DOn't take too much time backing up or you'll run out of time mid-jump or before you even get to the ramp
[0:51:05] phatscout: hospital is the goat station but tbh streamer mode limiting you to it is kinda repetitive
[0:51:54] phatscout: only so long someone can listen to two step drum pattern dnb before it gets kinda repetitive tbh
[0:52:08] demon_dandy: yeah i can imagine
[0:52:09] hajijo: That song is a goody
[0:52:24] hajijo: I love getting entranced in some good old D'n'B
[0:52:27] scratchingway: deshrimpification achieved
[0:52:34] smoreeater: lumituSimax cheers mate
[0:53:08] smoreeater: you feeling alright ashton? lumituHappy
[0:53:40] hajijo: SO CLOSE
[0:53:46] phatscout: also i just remembered that that annoying song from those grubhub ads is in the ost
[0:53:53] demon_dandy: just 100m short ashton51Bork
[0:53:59] phatscout: big w for streamer mode removing that lol
[0:54:29] HashiriyaR32: what is it?
[0:54:35] phatscout: it's on pulse i think
[0:54:44] Darkhollow360: Oh I love that song
[0:54:49] scratchingway: mintcPat mintcPat
[0:54:53] phatscout: wait no it's on Block Party
[0:54:53] HashiriyaR32: It's not "Feels so Good" by Luxury, is it? Because I think that's on Streamer
[0:54:57] phatscout: which is.... a choice
[0:54:57] HashiriyaR32: ....oh nvm
[0:55:08] phatscout: no "Soy Yo"
[0:55:55] PastaThief911: you ever played crazy taxi?
[0:56:01] phatscout: https://nfssoundtrack.com/forzahorizon5/ this is the full ost list for reference
[0:56:19] PastaThief911: man crazy taxi is one of my childhood games
[0:56:25] hajijo: Crazy Taxi was in a lot of arcades, you may have played it at some point
[0:56:39] phatscout: they ported to a ton of stuff
[0:56:41] hajijo: It was ported to the Dreamcast and some other systems too
[0:56:46] PastaThief911: it's on dreamcast and gamecube too
[0:56:48] frolic2000: i used to play it at cicis pizza
[0:56:49] phatscout: I had it on PS2 back in the day
[0:56:59] HashiriyaR32: Played the second game on dreamcast, with a wheel
[0:57:12] phatscout: dreamcast had a wheel?
[0:57:28] phatscout: this is ridicious

[0:57:43] nyandemonai_944: try going at an angle? turn left looks like the road is lower there and might give you more airtime
[0:57:44] frolic2000: ashton51Steer
[0:57:58] HashiriyaR32: It was easy to do Crazy Dash and other moves that needed quick shifting between reverse and forward because there were two rocker buttons on the left and right spoke of the wheel shifting

[1:08:12] HashiriyaR32: Not yet, there's still the stuff in the  gift box, which is LOT of goodies.
[1:08:24] HashiriyaR32: A lot of which you'll probably need for Hot Wheels
[1:08:39] HashiriyaR32: "Message Centre" and then toggle to "Gifts"
[1:08:41] jcall__: next time you're in the garage head to the livery section and search for your name 👀
[1:08:47] HashiriyaR32: You just skipped it
[1:08:59] HashiriyaR32: You scrolled past it and backed out
[1:09:11] hajijo: "Message Center", then "Gifts", then click on every email lol
[1:09:19] jcall__: we gotta get these gifts first
[1:09:29] HashiriyaR32: Yes
[1:09:36] hajijo: Yep, one by one lol

[1:11:00] hajijo: You're looking like a million bucks, Ashton!
[1:11:15] demon_dandy: get it twisted ashton51Tensai
[1:11:37] phatscout: for better or worse this game really doesn't have a real sense of progression cuz you're just showered in money and cars for doing basically anything
[1:12:02] jcall__: @phatscout my first horizon was 3, heard the progression was way slower back in 1 and 2
[1:12:25] phatscout: yeah fh1 was the only one that had an actual story campaign instead of just being a sandbox for the most part
[1:12:35] phatscout: I don't mind that but a lot of people take issue with that approach
[1:12:37] bockmind: ive been told the progression in 1 is the best\
[1:12:54] jcall__: waiting for the pc port of 1 that will never happen
[1:12:56] phatscout: (it's funny cuz the HW xp seems to be moving back in that direction and now people are mad about it doing that)
[1:13:05] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel better car, better person
[1:13:19] bockmind: f
[1:13:22] hajijo: This car is gonna go brrrrr
[1:13:39] bockmind: smooth
[1:13:41] jcall__: you say that car guy thing as a joke but that really is how it is
[1:13:44] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel wise words
[1:13:46] cametek: I don't have a car so either I don't have personality
[1:13:47] tetelande: ashton51Steer
[1:13:51] barfchan: ashton51Steer

[1:14:59] hajijo: Find new designs, then search for your name using the button with the two boxes in it
[1:15:27] bockmind: BRO THATS SICK

[1:15:57] bockmind: thats amazing
[1:16:03] bockmind: people are so talented

[1:16:19] phatscout: @jcall__ you the real mvp
[1:16:22] hajijo: You need to find the right car to attach it to!
[1:16:42] phatscout: wait isn't it already on?
[1:16:43] HashiriyaR32: No that's for a car you do not have
[1:16:58] hajijo: No, the liveries are for specific cars, so you need to figure out what car it's for, sadly.
[1:17:03] jcall__: that one you downloaded is for an Aston Martin, if you search yourself again but on the bronco you can find the other versiom
[1:17:13] HashiriyaR32: 2018 Aston Martin Vantage
[1:17:17] bockmind: lol
[1:17:42] hajijo: Thank you so much @jcall__ ! I wanted to do something like this but was having a hard time with it. lol
[1:17:44] bockmind: oop
[1:17:45] HashiriyaR32: Filter by setting "Make" and "model" to "Current Car"
[1:17:45] jcall__: So search ahain but change the make and model filters at the top to the current car
[1:17:53] demon_dandy: i saw it!
[1:17:54] phatscout: yeah just set it to current car for search
[1:17:55] jcall__: *search again

[1:23:46] jcall__: FACTS no fun allowed on forza
[1:23:58] supra_mike: well we know what has to be done now, make that design on every car in the game
[1:24:03] xnick291x: Ahh fair enough
[1:24:24] HashiriyaR32: I think the thing you have pinned next was the "History of Hot Wheels" Horizon Story, and the subtitles will be a great help.
[1:24:24] jcall__: @supra_mike NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:24:32] xnick291x: @supra_mike I will reinstall it and Itasha my Skyline

[1:24:55] hajijo: Maybe I'll make one for iRacing to impress online strangers later lol
[1:25:14] supra_mike: are you holding the Forza edition controller?
[1:25:40] HashiriyaR32: Options -> Accessibility
[1:25:42] bockmind: bladed angel
[1:25:51] jcall__: @hajijo make one for the miata and i'll run that when i get back into it no cap
[1:25:58] bockmind: bro he has an itasha corvette
[1:26:03] HashiriyaR32: Under Campaign

[1:27:04] xnick291x: I want to do an Itasha build in GTA Online
[1:27:14] hajijo: @hajijo Hell yeah. I will definitely do that then!
[1:27:20] xnick291x: Fastback Miata is Kreygasm
[1:27:20] demon_dandy: i saw an aqua itasha at the con here last online
[1:27:32] demon_dandy: last month*
[1:27:37] supra_mike: the 1st generation Miata is literally the cutest face I've ever seen on a car
[1:27:43] demon_dandy: i dont know how my brain did that tbh
[1:27:55] hajijo: Whipser me and I'll tell you where to find me on Trading Paints lol @jcall__
[1:28:22] demon_dandy: this cars a demon ashton51Steer
[1:28:24] phatscout: what's that thing in the center?
[1:28:31] supra_mike: every car in this race is refrencing the original hotwheels cars
[1:28:48] HashiriyaR32: Roll indicator
[1:28:58] ArdenYves: hi crashton ashton51Steer ashton51Kneel ashton51Love i’m smlurking ashton51Pog ashton51Tensai
[1:29:11] demon_dandy: !unlurk
[1:29:20] demon_dandy: just had to check
[1:29:30] phatscout: did they add that smash mouth song from world race to the soundtrack
[1:29:41] phatscout: like how lego had "everything is awesome" in it's expansion
[1:29:43] HashiriyaR32: Mag track!
[1:29:48] xnick291x: I might buy a car related thing today :3
[1:30:35] hajijo: We love to enable treating yourself!
[1:30:42] demon_dandy: ashton51Steer
[1:30:55] supra_mike: I it really a waste of it's something you want and like?
[1:31:05] hajijo: @supra_mike This is true!
[1:31:11] demon_dandy: that car is such an upgrade it seems
[1:31:13] xnick291x: @supra_mike you showed me it lmaoo
[1:31:35] HashiriyaR32: You have free fast travel in this map
[1:31:37] hajijo: I wanted a Miku figure and I got one and I cherish it every second so I totally get it lol
[1:31:42] supra_mike: @nick291x was it the Rot Sau Mercedes hotwheels?
[1:32:03] phatscout: i don't hate the approach they went for with this map but I kinda wished you were a small car in a normal sized world
[1:32:22] xnick291x: @supra_mike Nope, the MegaConstrux Tesco van :3
[1:32:25] phatscout: like you had an open world as a small car in some big backyard or some shit
[1:32:29] HashiriyaR32: It's because of the possibility of accidentally fligning yourself off the track and onto either another track level or just completely off it altogether
[1:32:34] demon_dandy: i got a tsuruya maid figure and it seems sooo classic
[1:32:43] supra_mike: the Tesco van hahah XD
[1:33:01] xnick291x: And me and Mike know each other through another content creator we both know
[1:33:15] frostedfennel: were u ever into world race/acceleracers? o:
[1:33:17] HashiriyaR32: Even the magnetic track can't handle cars going faster than 250 - 260 MPH
[1:33:30] xnick291x: And je sent me a link to your stream so now I'm here!
[1:33:49] supra_mike: i was going through Forza streams, found this one and was like FORZA? AND CUTE? SIGN ME UP
[1:34:04] xnick291x: If you were good, you wouldn't be funny or interesting!
[1:34:06] hajijo: S L I P S T R E A M
[1:34:07] kristofferfk2: DansGame
[1:34:49] HashiriyaR32: I wouldn't be an entertaining streamer.  I can't keep a convo going when I'm in the zone.
[1:34:50] xnick291x: Being good at something is totally subjective
[1:34:58] HashiriyaR32: And even then I'm not that good
[1:35:05] frostedfennel: the tracks in hot wheels games that are in like a basement or a backyard r so much more creative
[1:35:15] xnick291x: no thoughts, head empty
[1:35:20] supra_mike: well there's still the official hotwheels game if you want to drive a toy car through a living room
[1:35:32] demon_dandy: the mouse in my brain tells me  to watch ashton51Baby
[1:35:35] hajijo: No thoughts, just vibes
[1:35:48] hajijo: @demon_dandy piapiuWheeze piapiuWheeze piapiuWheeze
[1:36:03] supra_mike: from the looks of it she IS the mouse in your brain...
[1:36:14] HashiriyaR32: yes
[1:36:17] demon_dandy: HOOO
[1:36:19] HashiriyaR32: just barely
[1:36:20] hajijo: ooooo free car!
[1:36:21] demon_dandy: so closeee
[1:36:43] xnick291x: The Nash Metropolitan is such an interesting car!
[1:36:59] demon_dandy: i mean uh ashton51Tensai not even close at all for race chilla ashton
[1:37:10] phatscout: I haven't played HW Unleashed but I heard it was actually p good
[1:37:14] supra_mike: I wish Forza had the standard Nash alongside the hotwheels version
[1:37:22] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel
[1:37:25] brainlesscheeseburger: are they gonna do the lego stuff again?
[1:37:55] phatscout: They do 1 "goofy" expansion and one "regular" expansion per game
[1:37:57] hajijo: If I remember right, this game won an award at the Game Awards for sound design and accessibility
[1:38:11] supra_mike: @brainlesscheeseburger  it seems to alternate Horizon 5 is hotwheels, Horizon 4 had Lego and Horizon 3 was Hotwheels
[1:38:15] xnick291x: Has this been engine swapped?
[1:38:22] phatscout: usually they do the regular and then the goofy but this time they did it the other way around
[1:38:54] supra_mike: @nick291x  no that's been a bug since launch, that M3 has the wrong engine sound
[1:39:00] HashiriyaR32: I think nick's asking because this car has the sound from the 350Z
[1:39:09] HashiriyaR32: and the 350Z has this car's sound
[1:39:18] xnick291x: Sounds like the 2JZ to me
[1:39:20] phatscout: I'm still kinda disappointed they repeated the HW theme tbh
[1:39:37] bockmind: fh3
[1:39:38] xnick291x: Imagine a matchbox theme
[1:39:42] phatscout: yeah in FH3
[1:40:01] phatscout: FH3 did hot wheels for it's goofy expansion, FH4 was lego, and this did hot wheels again
[1:40:17] HashiriyaR32: It can be fixed, but only if you're on PC and it involves changing values in the XML files that control the engine sounds for those two cars.
[1:40:34] phatscout: I was kinda hoping for like, I dunno, Initial D with a cell shaded look to everything for the "goofy one" this year
[1:40:42] hajijo: Car go vroom, IMO
[1:40:57] phatscout: since for whatever reason they've been holding "full game set in japan" really close to their chest
[1:41:00] supra_mike: it doesn't bother me but I'm sure it's really bugs people who own either car irl XD
[1:41:00] HashiriyaR32: Ice Ice....maybe?
[1:41:16] demon_dandy: i wonder if theyll pull off a japan setting soon
[1:41:55] xnick291x: @phatscout I need an open world game set in Japan that's GTA Esque, not Yakuza though because I've played those to exhaustion
[1:42:16] HashiriyaR32: Now, before anyone beats me to it..........
[1:42:25] supra_mike: the next game is gonna be the next instalment in thee Forza Motorsport line, more track racing oriented and no open world
[1:42:27] xnick291x: But I mean with driving amd shooting elements
[1:42:34] HashiriyaR32: floor it!
[1:42:45] hajijo: Oh, Ramiro.....
[1:42:47] demon_dandy: woah ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[1:43:12] phatscout: iirc someone previously mentioned that they've been waiting on Japan because it would be a *very* dense city environment and they wanted to "get it right"
[1:43:16] hajijo: Ramiro is our boy and we love him
[1:43:28] hajijo: Yes, he's our pilot friend!
[1:43:51] bockmind: ramiro a true homie
[1:44:09] supra_mike: Ramiro, he's the pilot I've ever seen
[1:44:09] HashiriyaR32: There will be a danger sign there once you get to higher ranks
[1:44:09] xnick291x: Anyway I'm probably going to head to bed now, goodnight y'all
[1:44:13] demon_dandy: there it is ashton51Tensai the "hot wheel"
[1:44:22] xnick291x: I say as its 4am lmao
[1:44:28] demon_dandy: later nick! cheers for popping in
[1:44:34] hajijo: @nick291x Go to bed! lol
[1:44:38] supra_mike: the wheels aren't really hot rn are they lol
[1:44:40] hajijo: Good night though!
[1:44:47] supra_mike: ColdWheels
[1:45:03] HashiriyaR32: @nick291x That's how long I stayed up my time (EDT) on the morning of Canada day waiting for Demondice to take the stage at a concert in LA.
[1:45:07] hajijo: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[1:45:21] HashiriyaR32: I'm surprised she incorporated drum & bass into one of her new tracks
[1:45:47] supra_mike: @hashiriyar32  a fellow man of culture I see
[1:46:11] bockmind: what
[1:46:18] supra_mike: (I assume your a man forgive me if I was wrong lol)
[1:46:26] bockmind: lol
[1:46:29] HashiriyaR32: your assumption is right
[1:46:31] demon_dandy: music genre,its whats mostly playing rn
[1:46:44] hajijo: Drum and bass is one of my favorite genres of music, I can listen to it all day

[1:47:10] HashiriyaR32: The venue probably held no more than 100-150
[1:47:21] bockmind: all i can think when i hear car music now is phonk music
[1:47:25] hajijo: Well hey, you need a few car guys in a pit crew!
[1:47:33] bockmind: nah
[1:47:48] bockmind: f
[1:48:04] supra_mike: I've been hooked on drift phone music after seeing a hilarious clip of a guy dancing on the roadside in Japan with cars drifting by him

[1:49:56] supra_mike: it roughly means PAIN CAR
[1:50:10] HashiriyaR32: Nah, the pun was on Italian Car, which is ALSO called (Ita-sha)
[1:50:31] Biscuit_TMGS: Become my Japanese language teacher
[1:50:35] demon_dandy: its a diss but flipped
[1:50:41] HashiriyaR32: In reference to the flamboyant styling usually found on Italian supercars
[1:51:06] bockmind: bro bozuzoku is sick
[1:51:13] hajijo: Hell yeah, I wish to reach that level of weeb
[1:51:13] HashiriyaR32: The use of the kanji for pain in "ita" is basically because of how "Painful" the wrap looks
[1:51:27] supra_mike: it's like, the more it "hurts" the more proud of it you are in a way
[1:51:28] frostedfennel: shoutout to the lolita wearers in chat
[1:51:38] demon_dandy: the cringe car ashton51Baby

[1:55:31] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:55:32] supra_mike: I've seen this car irl, the one you just drove, it exists
[1:55:40] supra_mike: I was at a car show
[1:55:51] HashiriyaR32: Hot Wheels car made real
[1:55:58] frostedfennel: mhm deora II is down in cali somewhere i think
[1:56:02] bockmind: yeah hotwheels made a lot of the cars that are in this game irl
[1:56:04] hajijo: OH SHOOT, you've got have the Hot Wheels firesuit, I nearly forgot. Lol
[1:56:24] bockmind: there was also a car show where the winner got their own official hotwheels of their car
[1:56:35] supra_mike: there are alot of hotwheels that also exist irl, even the boneshaker monster truck is a real truck
[1:56:47] bockmind: yeah
[1:57:34] bockmind: hydroPlaneing
[1:57:48] bockmind: before
[1:58:01] supra_mike: before yeah
[1:58:11] HashiriyaR32: Some of the Hot Wheels cars available in game were real cars first, toys second.
[1:58:19] bockmind: yeah
[1:58:24] HashiriyaR32: eg. Nash Metropolitan, 2JetZ
[1:58:53] bockmind: also the car youre driving reminds me of an old dodge (i think) concept truck
[1:58:58] bockmind: it looks sick
[1:59:06] supra_mike: well the original boneshaker hotwheels was first, then the monster truck was built irl because kids love monster trucks and it was good advertisement, and then the monster truck got put in forza
[1:59:51] koroboul: Are we lost?
[1:59:57] supra_mike: @bockmind  the original 1960s Dodge Deora is what your thinking of
[1:59:58] koroboul: This feels like a maze
[2:00:21] bockmind: @supra_mike yeah
[2:00:32] bockmind: thanks for telling me the actual name
[2:00:46] supra_mike: hence why this futuristic one is called Deora II
[2:01:00] bockmind: yeah amkes sense
[2:01:07] HashiriyaR32: What's thie Deora II packing?
[2:01:09] HashiriyaR32: *this
[2:01:14] bockmind: but have you ever heard of the mustang II
[2:01:29] HashiriyaR32: ...oh dear, don't remind me of it
[2:01:55] supra_mike: sorry if I rant a little bit sometimes my brain is a library of obscure car facts and knowledge xD
[2:02:25] bockmind: i really want to buy an old mustang 2 and put a batter engine in it and completely bozuzoku it out
[2:02:32] bockmind: like a huge widebody kit
[2:02:53] supra_mike: I'm a big Toyota fan and I'm very dissapointed with the new Supra
[2:02:56] bockmind: and since its a mustang II nobody will know what to think
[2:03:11] bockmind: @supra_mike i think it gets too much hate though
[2:03:37] hajijo: The blessed HOONIGAN
[2:03:48] supra_mike: I love the pain schemes on Ken Block's cars
[2:04:10] bockmind: honestly they are surprisingly good
[2:04:28] barfchan: ashton51Steer
[2:04:36] supra_mike: that's actually a combination of slang words
[2:04:38] brainlesscheeseburger: travis pastrana or ken block
[2:04:56] bockmind: hooning and hooligan
[2:05:01] bockmind: right?
[2:05:09] supra_mike: "Hooking" is Aussie slang for doing burnouts and stuff, and they merged it with Hooligan
[2:05:10] HashiriyaR32: yeah, this is Ken Block's car i think
