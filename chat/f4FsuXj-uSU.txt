[0:14:20] MostPerfectPenguin: you're streams are *good* Ashton. Having fun new ideas is awesome and we'll look forward to it! But it's hardly a reason for any other stream you have to be lesser.
[0:14:30] rikkaonline: this is the kind of self imposed pressure that causes the biggest streamers to stop streaming and make second channels. us viewers are fine with your standard ashton stream
[0:14:32] Senoquese: youre setting the bar up too high and assuming the worst out of mere numbers that could mean anything
[0:14:35] DavidPortnov: My thing is that I often want to play the games you stream myself first.
[0:14:52] jherchin12345: don’t be sorry we all have those days
[0:14:52] Romblymo: The strategy then is to yap randomly in the middle to force people to watch and wait for the juicy juicy yaps

[1:40:09] phloeh: platos cave
[1:40:14] F1nalStarman: Plato's Parable of the Cave
[1:40:17] vera_aisight: theres an idolmaster song about that!!!
[1:40:38] demon_dandy: Too late i took the +2 yummmmm
[1:40:39] peachuuuu: men will literally allegorise the cave before going to therapy
[1:40:50] Qrockpot: whats this about a cave
[1:40:58] DerSeelander: I find it interesting, it's like seeing women at the Hololive concert and Expo, as massive fans for the big female Holo talents
[1:41:04] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:41:15] bonatide: We're hitting the the truest ashton yaps now

[1:43:10] DavidPortnov: I'm kind of into this.
[1:43:12] peachuuuu: i meant the kanji lol
[1:43:52] Qrockpot: is that something people feel?
[1:44:09] DerSeelander: Oh no, I hope I didn't make you self conscious about this going forward
[1:44:41] Romblymo: I would think its the opposite more often where girls feel singled out for being the minority in the space
[1:45:08] DerSeelander: I was at Holofes last year, and the camera guys would roll around to the foreigners and the girls in the audience
[1:45:20] vera_aisight: i wish there was more women to talk to about imas i genuinely wonder why more arent into it
[1:45:22] PSYCOMMUnist: I mean the term for this is gender politics but I know you probably want to avoid that lol
[1:45:33] Romblymo: back before anime cons and stuff were more normie I had a lot of friends only go to events like once because they didn't like being the only girl
[1:45:41] DerSeelander: lol
[1:45:44] spikebomb5: on the flip side, girls can be othered by not being one of the guys
[1:45:47] vera_aisight: like, love live isnt any less male demographic
[1:47:09] demon_dandy: It kinda spirals in on itself
[1:47:12] DavidPortnov: This exactly! That's what I thought until maybe a couple of years ago.
[1:47:17] bonatide: Trvke

[1:47:47] rikkaonline: yay no competition in my anime fantasy
[1:47:55] DerSeelander: Oh man, I got lectured by a Japanese dude at Holofes for not  knowing all of the names of 765 pro
[1:48:00] Superfroakie82: its a little fair cuz usually the male character is horribly written
[1:48:20] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[1:48:22] DerSeelander: I know them I just forgot their names...
[1:48:23] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:48:28] thomas_pitch: I think Nerf did the same thing with Nerf Rebelle.
[1:48:41] InsaneLoke: calling yourself horribly written
[1:48:53] PSYCOMMUnist: nepuGayface

[1:48:55] Qrockpot: omg nerf rebelle mentioned, foam flinger SPOTTED
[1:48:59] demon_dandy: I think its also just how accessible a media is
[1:49:18] spikebomb5: ashton51Stare has there still not been a series thats only robots and monsters
[1:49:35] Qrockpot: Rebelle is a line of nerf guns made to market towards girls
[1:49:39] vera_aisight: CG is still on CR at least
[1:49:51] revolverbrocelot: I'm learning a lot
[1:50:16] spikebomb5: lmaoooo, knock off DVA style
[1:50:35] DavidPortnov: ashton51Noted
[1:50:39] spikebomb5: sao gungale online
[1:50:42] InsaneLoke: not quite what pinkwashing means but i get what ur saying LMFAO
[1:50:42] Superfroakie82: i’ve heard that the nerf rebelle line is generally considered better than the adjacent “boys line” at the time too, better gimmicks etc
[1:50:50] Bamaut: im an hour and 50 minutes late to the stream, glad I didnt miss the start of the game ashton51Heyyy
[1:51:18] InsaneLoke: pinkwashing is like rainbow capitalism
[1:51:32] Romblymo: The rebel line never saw any competitive play though

[1:52:18] bonatide: I think its pitcrew in particular
[1:52:21] DerSeelander: That's because the default internet male is a Redditor
[1:52:33] pantalaimon91: @DerSeelander It's mostly that
[1:52:35] Romblymo: no the Toa are just cool, they were like gijoes
[1:52:36] spikebomb5: thats just normal geek tier like warhammer or gundam
[1:52:37] PSYCOMMUnist: I preferred lego before bionicles when I was a kid, but it's licensed sets in particular I hated
[1:52:42] Bamaut: I wanna say depends on age but im not sure.  I grew up with them
[1:52:43] revolverbrocelot: Oh shit. I'm rumbled.
[1:52:46] DavidPortnov: I know nothing about Nerf and only have a surface level of knowledge about Bionicle.
[1:52:47] Senoquese: still is

[5:15:35] cyriuhawk: They have tried many times and always get it wrong
[5:15:48] dax812: I like when he had a big gun appear in the sky and said "the real weapons are school shooters"
[5:16:19] drknoodles15: Why does it sound like she was saying "WHORE"?
[5:16:45] demon_dandy: Also tbf compared to what re movies had before the only direction is up
[5:16:56] shindigs: i think he said his favorite is 4
[5:16:59] shindigs: but unknown
[5:17:00] dax812: Aren't the RE movies just kinda based on the characters?
[5:17:06] dax812: Like "this is the Chris movie" type thing
[5:17:34] Returner7: yeah RE4 is kinda just an Action move w/ horror elements
[5:17:36] demon_dandy: Miss 10 grenades
[5:17:46] Navy_Mongoose: the RE movies are based on the director's wife doing badass things while naked and also "Here's Jill as a side character"
[5:17:48] dax812: what's that RE movie where they're shooting at each other point blank and keep missing
[5:17:53] cyriuhawk: Me Chris and punch boulders

[5:18:47] McDoomington2: Basically every RE has been based on horror movies to some degree up to 5. 4 takes it's over the top mix of action and horror from Evil Dead.
[5:18:54] bonatide: Not at all
[5:19:01] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, but he doesn't need to bastardize RE for it
[5:19:03] pogotross: I mean if she was already doing it...
[5:19:05] dax812: Isn't that what Tim Burton does
[5:19:05] Navy_Mongoose: or Monster Hunter either
[5:19:05] Qrockpot: Is the wife okay with it?
[5:19:06] Senoquese: james gunn is based for that
[5:19:13] McDoomington2: Depends on what the wife thinks.
[5:19:15] bonatide: Cuck shit 100%
[5:19:15] Superfroakie82: i mean if shes into it
[5:19:32] Qrockpot: She might like the power trip
[5:19:43] dax812: Director's cuck chair
[5:19:47] demon_dandy: Theyre good loot ashton51Baby
[5:19:53] Navy_Mongoose: RE films and Monster Hunter are all the same stupid movie that have nothing to do with the games they're based on
