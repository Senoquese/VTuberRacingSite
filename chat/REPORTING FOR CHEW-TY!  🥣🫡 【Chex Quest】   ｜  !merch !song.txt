[1:53:56] Senoquese: LOL
[1:54:09] Burr11: i wonder how they came up with the idea to do this
[1:54:34] Senoquese: copying doom was the thing to do around this time
[1:54:41] GManx0: You cant copyright gameplay tho
[1:54:42] chinfoil: id software was famously not litigious about it
[1:54:43] Burr11: pretty sure they paid id software to use their tech or somethin
[1:54:47] kunoichi_master: it's shareware, not an actual commercial game
[1:54:56] Navy_Mongoose: "DOOM clones" were the term for games we currently call "shooters"
[1:55:07] Kitkattack: didn't they sell floppys of DOOM?
[1:55:21] anonsama9001: ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:55:36] Protonic_: it came on 5-6 floppies
[1:55:43] Senoquese: at this time id software moved on to quake and they gave away the source code to doom to basically any company that asked
[1:56:10] GManx0: Woah, Phlem be upon you
[1:56:13] 4thAce_: All Doom tracks are basically ripped off metal songs so its not like they cared abt copyright
[1:56:27] Burr11: "For budgetary reasons, Id Software was contacted and an inexpensive license was obtained for the Doom engine which was considered obsolete in light of Id's then-recent release of Quake."
[1:56:30] Senoquese: no they got the license for this
[1:56:33] Burr11: so they did license it
[1:56:33] Senoquese: @Burr11 this
[1:57:11] GManx0: How long can this game possibly be

[1:57:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @gmanx0 its a few hours as a kid
[1:57:44] Rhou_0: You're playing basically a modded doom lol
[1:57:47] Senoquese: a lot of companies tried to make doom clones but id was chill and would rather give their source code for companies to make proper clones

[2:59:02] HDoomGuy: and yeah win2000/xp games are the worst for setting shit up. anything earlier than that is doable but tech support for mid-00's games is just "pray"
[2:59:14] JTBun: you're 10% done
[2:59:21] Senoquese: its why i much prefer giving you zip versions of games and knowing youll figure everything out ashton51Omega which is why bnw was a shame for needing that much stupid effort

[3:23:20] chinfoil: chainsaw ahh spork
[3:23:22] Octopimp: ashton you need to zorch the fuck out of these guys
[3:23:28] Navy_Mongoose: @HDoomGuy if she doesn't I do
[3:23:36] Senoquese: ICANT
[3:23:52] Senoquese: getting dosbox setup is not worth it for the 2 hours at most youll spend with random games
[3:23:57] GManx0: You are a Vtuber. You signed up to tech talk
[3:23:57] Kitkattack: you're awesome Hdoomguy, I assure you she'll never make use of it
[3:24:02] InsaneLoke: ist a big box of physical files with pencil written code
[3:24:14] HDoomGuy: nah it takes zero effort, i've literally made it so you just press the file and it runs no matter what
[3:24:46] Senoquese: wait theres cheat codes up to skipping 9 levels but theres only 5 levels. what the hell do the other codes do
[3:25:00] Protonic_: were they copied from doom?
[3:25:05] HDoomGuy: hell yeah. i'll stop by discord and drop it off later
[3:25:30] bonavier: You NEED to be shoved in a locker
[3:25:38] Senoquese: oh lmao the cheat codes are all new but they accidentally take you to real doom levels if you input numbers too high
[3:26:28] HDoomGuy: @Senoquese it's worth it if you offsource it to bored people like me
[3:26:36] Senoquese: yes LOLLL
[3:26:38] InsaneLoke: what did you want to bitch about
[3:26:42] HDoomGuy: lmfao i actually never knew that about chex quest

[3:29:42] johnnyrob5677: chex quest hell yea
[3:29:59] GManx0: Passive positivity?
[3:30:27] Kitkattack: it just sounds like imposter syndrome sort of deal
[3:30:33] InsaneLoke: i get it, every year of college felt like the first one
[3:30:34] chinfoil: I getcha
[3:30:43] johnnyrob5677: so you want people to agree with you?
[3:30:45] HDoomGuy: yeah, dunning-kruger effect
[3:30:49] justchiken: ashton51Nodders
[3:31:04] Senoquese: i didnt interpret it that way at all but looking back you did write it in a very ashtony humor way which wed already know is not like that
[3:31:09] kunoichi_master: that one quote about how science is just figuring out what we don't know
[3:31:22] kunoichi_master: *how much we don't know
[3:32:29] HDoomGuy: i feel like its a problem with social media in theory vs social media in practice. sometimes you just wanna air out a thought
[3:33:45] Senoquese: like we pitcrew already know perfectly what you mean but i can see ppl finding you randomly on their TL and thinkin u were a random sad vtuber
[3:33:48] ReyJaggy: Ashton aint a long indie she is just 10 skates tall

[3:36:37] HDoomGuy: oh blackpilled isn't political its just 'doomer/nihilistic/etc.'
[3:36:40] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, blackpill is just taking the nihilistic outlook on everything
[3:36:48] Senoquese: LOL

[3:36:49] EricDFreak: HUH

[3:37:14] HDoomGuy: it's kinda an offshoot of a political term but isn't in itself so i get it
[3:37:17] Silentghost0004: it can be political tbh, just a very dark outlook on life
[3:37:27] InsaneLoke: its like how everything has a 'blank'maxxing, everything has a pill
