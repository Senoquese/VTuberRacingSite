[2:00:44] horribleham: Skyrim has one thing over fallout 4 and it's that it at least gives you freedom. You can make up any background you want for your character and what your personal journey is. Fallout 4 just makes you a mom or dad obsessed with finding their lame son.

[2:05:37] demon_dandy: Also maybe its only me but i had more fun betting believer vs doubter ashton51Tensai but that probably doesnt matter
[2:05:44] Kitkattack: just not a fan of kart races in general
[2:05:48] imnoteds: i think some of this here that are really good at mario kart should nerf themself, for example asterite, its not hard just picking some wacky combos and have fun with the rest
[2:05:51] demon_dandy: Only blue shells LMAK
[2:05:52] mushi_buns: mario rpg is really good!!!
[2:05:55] Burr11: i feel like 200cc annoyed the sweats and i actually won and did well several times in that haha

[2:07:07] Navy_Mongoose: Mario RPG was a joint project between Square and Nintendo and was the first soundtrack composed by Yoko Shimomura (Kingdom Hearts composer)
[2:07:20] JTBun: OG MK isn't that great
[2:07:24] demon_dandy: You could do a mario kart retrospective ashton51Tehe

[2:12:41] Senoquese: theres no way youd have fun playing against people that have experience
[2:12:48] Senoquese: i dont even play fighting games with my friends anymore because of that
[2:12:48] Navy_Mongoose: eyes of heaven is the double battles one
[2:12:52] Returner7: yeah fighting game lobbies are extra sweat mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats
[2:13:01] demon_dandy: @senoquese ehhh i feel like some experienced people know to hold back
[2:13:03] mushi_buns: I have heard fighting game fans are the sweatiest
[2:13:04] Burr11: street fighter 6 is pretty accessible with the modern controls and matchmaking
[2:13:05] Kitkattack: lmao jojo pt6
[2:13:16] Senoquese: @demon_dandy yeah but at that point its kinda less fun
[2:13:22] Kitkattack: Ashton idk if you'd like getting stomped
[2:13:22] ApocalypseSC: i thought strive wasnt bad to pick up as my first fighting game
[2:13:26] TheAsterite: fight stick for sure
[2:13:26] imnoteds: keyboard
[2:13:28] mushi_buns: !jump
[2:13:29] JTBun: just play with contoller
[2:13:29] AshtonMarten: 2am_buns has won 5 from the jump catch game!
[2:13:31] Senoquese: keyboard or controller
[2:13:34] Zerorush: Actually that’s kinda a good point. If you think Mario kart is sweaty then experienced fighting game players are worse lol
[2:13:36] Burr11: a fight stick is better technically but guys have won tournaments with controller
[2:13:36] Senoquese: fight stick is completely optional
[2:13:37] Returner7: for modern, it's really up to you
[2:13:40] steel_valiant: Trackball! meatsAA
[2:13:41] demon_dandy: trueeee shimada collab ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[2:13:41] Navy_Mongoose: I prefer fight stick, nothing wrong with controller. I learned how to play fighters on a keyboard
[2:13:44] ApocalypseSC: nothing wrong with a controller
[2:13:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: if you havent learned fighting games yet then fightstick
[2:13:51] Kitkattack: a lot of pro's use controllers
[2:13:51] Senoquese: i dont know who told you you need a fight stick 😭
[2:13:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: just learn instead of relearning
[2:13:54] Returner7: yes most modern fightsticks are basically keyboards
[2:13:54] imnoteds: fightsticks arent better, they are just mostly a novelty at this point
[2:13:56] justcerebro: I play fighting games on keyboard ashton51Smile
[2:13:57] demon_dandy: Keyboard is popular cause its all buttons ashton51Tehe
[2:14:01] Burr11: fight sticks are good for old school arcade games too which is nice
[2:14:15] Zerorush: Whatever your more comfortable with it doesn’t really matter tbh
[2:14:32] mushi_buns: they better not be making you work more!!
[2:14:37] Burr11: ashton51Love
[2:14:38] ApocalypseSC: trickle down free time

[2:14:49] demon_dandy: Perfect time to get into fighting games and final fantasy 14 ashton51Smile
[2:14:51] Senoquese: fight sticks are better if youve reached the peak with your best controller input. if you dont know how to play its really useless
[2:14:53] Returner7: it's off season!!! ashton51Baby
[2:14:55] Zerorush: Fight sticks became a big business because people wanna relive the arcade experience. There’s tons of young blood winning tournaments on controllers these days
[2:15:08] Burr11: would love to watch a FF14 stream lol
[2:15:11] Mocchiari: Tru! I'm already 100+hrs in

[2:15:35] Burr11: what makes you think people dont like it i feel like almost every vtuber plays it XD
[2:15:45] Kitkattack: I'm not crazy about 14 but if we start a guild ashton51Kneel
[2:15:49] Burr11: oh true
[2:15:52] Zerorush: Get obsessed with Baldur’s Gate 3 instead ashton51Steer
[2:15:59] demon_dandy: Its hard to watch mmos if its not community stuff yeah ashton51Tehe
[2:16:04] Senoquese: hm yeah it really depends on the streamer

[2:16:20] justcerebro: I've been going insane over FF11 but no one I know plays that ashton51Wibble
[2:16:20] Navy_Mongoose: Astarion is boyfriend material
[2:16:39] Senoquese: mmo streams basically make you rely on all the entertainment, the actual gameplay is knida boring to watch ashton51Tehe
[2:16:43] mushi_buns: genshin you mention yes
[2:16:44] Returner7: they screw up the affection values in the beginning, everybody was soo horny when I started LMAO
