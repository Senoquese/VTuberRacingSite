[1:55:57] Burr11: ] The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966), the Beatles' Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and the Who's Tommy (1969) are variously cited as "the first concept album", usually for their "uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif".[24]

[1:57:29] demon_dandy: At the very least, the beatles did a more concrete concept album i imagine
[1:57:32] DatBoiVLC: @T33bags but an album was still meant to be consumed as a single piece in the past, you wouldn't just needle drop for one song on an LP
[1:57:45] rikkaonline: reading about pet sounds being important and then actually listening to it, its underwhelming. still super good though

[3:18:20] Apollo_Neos: Mario galaxy
[3:18:23] InsaneLoke: the wii u had more hits tbh, even though it had way less games overall
[3:18:25] TheElfiestElf: pinball wizard
[3:18:27] Azn_Tempest: Twilight Princess? Skyward Sword? Mario Galaxy?
[3:18:31] Navy_Mongoose: RE4 is best on the Wii

[3:18:47] denpafish: the Wii one
[3:18:55] Azn_Tempest: Wii Sports, technically
[3:19:06] TheElfiestElf: RE4
[3:19:08] JaAmfan: yeah RE4 is ironically one of the best ways to play it
[3:19:13] TheElfiestElf: Yes that was a pinball wizard joke
[3:19:16] Azn_Tempest: since every Wii came with a copy of it ashton51Heh
[3:19:17] anonsama9001: RE4 wii port is really fun
[3:19:18] Navy_Mongoose: Resident Evil 4 port, I consider that to be the best version
[3:19:25] TheAsterite: wii games? xenoblade chronicles was originally on wii
[3:19:26] denpafish: cooking mama on the Wii was torture
[3:19:29] demon_dandy: pullin up cod on the wii ashton51Tensai

[3:19:32] denpafish: More effort than it’s worth
[3:19:36] Returner7: you can
[3:19:52] TheAsterite: xenoblade chronicles is very good
[3:19:52] Navy_Mongoose: you don't need the zapper, it came out before it iirc
[3:19:54] anonsama9001: yup, and it surprisingly lends itself to the tank controls well
[3:20:01] JaAmfan: whats funny is it just obliterates the difficulty from the gamecube version
[3:20:04] Apollo_Neos: Wii sports too such a great game
[3:20:06] Azn_Tempest: the zapper? yup
[3:20:07] JaAmfan: its way easier to aim
[3:20:50] Navy_Mongoose: tbh, you would probably feel badass using a zapper for RE4
[3:20:51] demon_dandy: Oh no more heroes on the wii was better than the other versions
[3:20:55] JaAmfan: OH and dont forget sin and punishment
[3:21:11] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[3:21:18] DatBoiVLC: @demon_dandy many people recharging their lightsaber...
[3:21:28] TheElfiestElf: maaan I remember wondering how the hell NMH was even allowed on the 'family friendly' console.
[3:21:29] demon_dandy: Theres a gba version??
[3:21:34] Navy_Mongoose: but RE4 has a lot of QTEs that feel natural to do with the wii waggles
[3:21:58] JaAmfan: @TheElfiestElf madworld and red steel were pretty graphic also
[3:21:58] demon_dandy: @theelfiestelf that and madworld sheeeeesh ashton51Tensai

[3:39:49] Burr11: mega man x
[3:39:52] JaAmfan: 2 is definitely the easiest
[3:39:52] TheAsterite: that's too much of a loaded question
[3:39:56] TheAsterite: ashton51Omega
[3:39:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: MEGA MAN X is best BUT its too long

[3:41:38] yojamjam: mega man 1 kinda blows
[3:41:40] Burr11: they're not really connected
[3:41:44] Navy_Mongoose: MM2 is the easiest and truest to the mega man experience
[3:41:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: 2 i think starts having lore
[3:41:52] Navy_Mongoose: 1 has bullshit oversights
[3:41:55] anonsama9001: MM1 is pretty rough
