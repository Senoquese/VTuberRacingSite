[1:42:49] Navy_Mongoose: I still can't get over you calling the sequels  "The Adam Driver Movies" ashton51Tehe
[1:42:55] InsaneLoke: they arent THAT bad
[1:43:00] JTBun: didnt know ash is a robo fucker
[1:43:03] Burr11: it was kinda neat seeing your perspective was coming from only the sequels though!
[1:43:03] JaAmfan: you know, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
[1:43:13] dax812: moar
[1:43:23] vohl_: racer canonically likes adam DRIVER
[1:43:33] dax812: "Why is this just the sequels but done better"
[1:43:39] fullcrackalchemist: Simping for Adam Driver is the only thing that made the sequels enjoyable for me
[1:43:41] Umbra_Custos: where is that picture where he looks like a dorito with fuckin tights hiked up through his ass crack
[1:43:42] TurnLeftman: Are you going to watch the prequels next? They're weird, but good in hindsight
[1:43:43] yojamjam: this watch order has never been attempted before, you're a case study
[1:43:47] dax812: When the sequel first came out everyone was like "why is it just the same thing?"
[1:43:53] minister_of_fecal_affairs: 7 was a direct take on 4
[1:43:59] Umbra_Custos: @TurnLeftman ...prequels?
[1:44:06] Jumper5642: Star Wars?
[1:44:33] dax812: They weren't as quippy in the original trilogy
[1:44:37] Jumper5642: omg, I know this
[1:44:38] phatcombatant: George Lucas’s ideas for the sequel trilogy was so good but Disney canned that
[1:44:49] Jumper5642: @phatcombatant yeah
[1:44:52] fullcrackalchemist: So much changed with the director/plan changes, it resulted in no coherent vision for the sequels
[1:44:59] shallows_: Lucas learned from the GOAT (Kurosawa)
[1:45:00] StreamElements: Join the pit crew and your transformation will begin! Feel your soft fluff, your plush round body, and cute stubby legs on this plush made in your image: https://www.makeship.com/petitions/pit-crew-plush
[1:45:12] vohl_: yeah didn't the editor save it from being ass?
[1:45:13] Senoquese: the sequels tried to subvert the subversions and just did the exact same things
[1:45:21] orminthebox: 8 is kinda funny imo
[1:45:21] Burr11: there was also a book sequel series that people said was really good that disney ignored as well
[1:45:23] shallows_: Im an Episode 8 truther
[1:45:29] dax812: George is a genius like when he said "we need more weird aliens in this scene less Darth Vader"
[1:45:32] demon_dandy: it was worth it ashton51Cope we got star wars kinect out of it
[1:45:34] rikkaonline: lucas has great ideas, he just needs people to temper them into a great final product
[1:45:35] HmmHrmHarumph: I like 8 except for the jokes
[1:45:39] Umbra_Custos: @Senoquese it was different directors trying to glaze themselves using Star Wars
[1:45:43] KillerQ13: Poor George...got surrounded by yes men
[1:46:04] fullcrackalchemist: @demon_dandy REAL actual best star wars media
[1:46:06] KazooManEvan: Ashton if you're the race queen are the mods the crew chiefs
[1:46:09] phatcombatant: you have seen the prequel trilogy?
[1:46:24] Jumper5642: I will give the sequels a thumbs up on the Visuals, they looked pretty good for the most part, but the story was so bad
[1:46:30] Burr11: lol yeah so many bad changes
[1:46:31] Senoquese: its crazy how the sequel's palpatine plot line was revealed exclusively through a fortnite event and not in any movies or series
[1:46:41] chinfoil: god the CGI in that era lol
[1:46:42] SolAzul42: Looking forward to your opinions on Jar Jar Binks :)
[1:46:52] 99d9: roger roger
[1:46:52] Senoquese: its unfortunately true

[1:46:56] rikkaonline: its true
[1:46:56] KazooManEvan: It...it's true
[1:46:56] JaAmfan: it is true
[1:46:57] Navy_Mongoose: SOMEHOW... PALPATINE RETURNED
[1:47:00] shallows_: Episode 3 is like pretty good in parts but 1 and 2............................................
[1:47:00] demon_dandy: Yeahhhhh the retouch of the old scenes is so messed up
[1:47:01] yojamjam: that reads like a seno shitpost but it happened
[1:47:01] orminthebox: I like the prequels personally, they aren't the best but I have the nostalgia
[1:47:11] Navy_Mongoose: yes, you need to play the Fortnite Event to hear Palpatine explain that he returned
[1:47:12] rodetovenaar: You would never know how Palpatine returned if you didn't play Fortnite
[1:47:19] Burr11: the prequels aren't amazing but at least they had heart and soul unlike the sequels
[1:47:21] dax812: I think we should've seen at least 1 ewok get lightsabered
[1:47:23] demon_dandy: Clueless
[1:47:24] Umbra_Custos: I watched the recent re-showing of Revenge of the Sith, it was an experience

[1:47:31] Jumper5642: @Burr11 exactly
[1:47:35] shallows_: I Cannot wait until you get to the Gungan part of Episode 1 ICANT
[1:47:45] minister_of_fecal_affairs: At least the prequels were one sort of coherent story
[1:47:46] fullcrackalchemist: The first two prequels are bad but the third has some insane high points
[1:47:47] phatcombatant: @umbra_custos same it was magical
[1:47:47] rikkaonline: revenge of the sith is 3
[1:47:48] Senoquese: revenge of the sith is ep3
[1:47:54] Umbra_Custos: no it was the theatrical release
[1:47:55] InsaneLoke: ROTS came out in 2005 it already had good CGI
[1:47:57] Navy_Mongoose: Goongas
[1:47:59] Burr11: yeah revenge of the sith is peak
[1:48:03] JaAmfan: i think there's only one cut of 3
[1:48:04] dax812: Gungy
[1:48:07] 99d9: CLASSIC
[1:48:10] rodetovenaar: No, Gungans are an alien
[1:48:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: gungan is a race in star wars
[1:48:12] pogotross: no Jarjar is a gungan
[1:48:12] aureliangates: gunga ginga
[1:48:14] shallows_: Gungan is the race of jar jar
[1:48:26] Burr11: a new hope, empire strikes back, return of the jedi
[1:48:28] rikkaonline: return of the jedi is 6, so 3 has a similar but opposite name

[1:52:14] InsaneLoke: i really wanna watch andor with you its great
[1:52:16] KazooManEvan: Inb4 ash gets obsessed with star wars and makes us watch clone wars at gunpoint
[1:52:18] demon_dandy: the 12 angry men bit Classic
[1:52:22] shallows_: i didnt care for Rogue One that much tbh it seemed so dry and bleh to me. like saltine crackers with no soup

[1:52:51] shallows_: And or what?
[1:52:54] phatcombatant: Andor season 2
[1:52:55] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Andor and rogue one are very 70s
[1:52:59] Burr11: yup andor is incredible
[1:53:00] minister_of_fecal_affairs: people say that show is legit
[1:53:05] 99d9: tactical droid would cancel you anyway ashton51Omegalul
[1:53:05] orminthebox: I think I need to rewatch rogue one, cause everyone I know loves it but I remember really NOT
[1:53:06] Umbra_Custos: the bloops and the bleeps, huh
[1:53:06] TurnLeftman: Andor is the best piece of Star Wars media since Disney
[1:53:07] dax812: Everyone acting like Andor is the new Severance
[1:53:12] Navy_Mongoose: the bleeps, sweeps, and creeps
[1:53:13] Senoquese: andor is really good but i think rogue one is the one movie that should count as part of the mandatory main series
[1:53:16] shallows_: Rogue One is like a dry rehash imo
[1:53:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I like the baby yoda show
[1:53:18] mrvacbob: bluesky loves andor ime
[1:53:20] InsaneLoke: andor isnt that long but it would be great for a discord watchalong
[1:53:21] minister_of_fecal_affairs: I got completely put off of Star Wars during the sequels, but might have to check that out
[1:53:25] demon_dandy: Oh wait people were saying rogue 1 was kinda sick
[1:53:32] JaAmfan: i almost walked out of rogue 1 i cant lie man
[1:53:36] mrvacbob: because they only want to talk about US politics and andor is politics
[1:53:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: what?!
[1:53:41] Burr11: i liked rogue one *shrug*
[1:53:42] pogotross: ok but what about the holiday special?
[1:53:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: rogue one had amazing reviews
[1:53:47] dax812: They be makin shows out of any character like new episodes of Glumbo Plumbo
[1:53:50] minister_of_fecal_affairs: very divisive
[1:53:52] Navy_Mongoose: only the disney star wars kiddies hate Rogue One and Andor
[1:53:52] Senoquese: i thought it was one of the best movies in the franchise lol
[1:54:07] shallows_: Im just gonna start hating on all of Star Wars to balance out chat. we need more haters here.
[1:54:07] orminthebox: the politics is not why I didn't like Rogue one, to be clear
[1:54:08] Burr11: i think some of the rogue one hate is purely because of the CGI actors at the end
[1:54:11] shallows_: Star wars was NEVER GOOD
[1:54:12] Umbra_Custos: Rogue One was a lot of espionage and moving pieces, and *surprise* it includes politics
[1:54:12] rikkaonline: wait until you find out what the original star wara is about
[1:54:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I mean the 70s series is very much about that yes
[1:54:20] phatcombatant: every one loves rouge one I thought it was fine
[1:54:24] KazooManEvan: "I hate when they made star wars political" Wars is in the name ICANT
[1:54:24] JaAmfan: star wars was an analogue for vietnam so i guess it would make sense
[1:54:25] minister_of_fecal_affairs: they tried that with Picard too
[1:54:29] dax812: Good thing the original trilogy doesn't have politics, just good ol fashioned rise against a tyrannical government
[1:54:34] Senoquese: good luck with the vods ash!!!!
[1:54:38] niertlwal: @mrvacbob bsky exists as a hellscape for people who love to nag
[1:54:39] demon_dandy: the only political star wars ever, the pod racing game
[1:54:41] chinfoil: it's almost like them deleting vods is arbitrary or something
[1:54:48] minister_of_fecal_affairs: though Star Trek was always kind of political

[1:56:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: well in the prequels jedis were a rumor. so he was a non believer
[1:56:52] TurnLeftman: These were the kind of things people had issues with the prequels over
[1:56:53] ReyJaggy: +2 dax
[1:56:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i mean in the OGs not prequels
[1:57:04] dax812: Han refers to the force as a religion though
[1:57:47] JaAmfan: well darth vader gets told off by one of his officers who calls the force an "ancient religion" he obsesses over
[1:57:51] minister_of_fecal_affairs: It's a warrior monk sect, guess we don't really have that here
[1:57:53] Senoquese: its a commentary on religion but george lucas is not religious and its not 1:1 to a specific religion, i didnt understand what you meant before yeah
[1:57:59] Burr11: oh no not to that point
[1:57:59] orminthebox: I don't think so, I think it was just a theme
[1:58:05] JaAmfan: but no i dont think star wars has much to say about religion
[1:58:06] Burr11: he just borrowed stuff for flavor
[1:58:09] fullcrackalchemist: yeah it's not a hard allegory, it's not like Dune or Narnia with explicit meanings and stances
[1:58:12] kaotan48: stars wars copies everything
[1:58:12] InsaneLoke: jedi isnt meant to be some commentary about how god is reap
[1:58:14] InsaneLoke: yeah
[1:58:15] dax812: idk how anime discussion gets low views when we are literally having the nerdiest discussion of all time ashton51Omegalul
[1:58:23] Umbra_Custos: but you are crazy, ashton
[1:58:26] pogotross: people want their space adventure pew pew movie to mean more than it really does
[1:58:47] demon_dandy: Doesnt that still make it allegorical?
[1:59:01] dax812: Is there a Veggie Tales Star Wars parody
[1:59:03] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke when god is sow haha fuck yeah when god is reap this fucking sucks
[1:59:07] fullcrackalchemist: I do know
[1:59:07] Burr11: to be allegorical it needs to match more 1:1 and have a real point to it
[1:59:08] demon_dandy: Its a stand in no?
[1:59:09] JaAmfan: it takes bits from abrahamic religions and eastern ones to conplete the setting
[1:59:11] Burr11: but it's just space magic in the end
[1:59:14] rikkaonline: yeah i think the force is completely detached from irl religion
[1:59:14] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese true!
[1:59:36] ReyJaggy: oh i get it, like allegory is hidden, but the force being a religion is literally revealed to be a thing
[1:59:42] InsaneLoke: its inspired by yeah
[1:59:42] dax812: I looked up "Is the force real" and google said no its from a movie
[1:59:47] Senoquese: george lucas isnt really religious and wasnt inspired by any specific religion, he just wanted to write about a silly space religion
[1:59:49] TurnLeftman: Only slightly. It was a single George Lucas quote. It's mostly just a mixture of cowboy movies, kurosawa movies, and sci-fi serials
[1:59:51] niertlwal: oh no
