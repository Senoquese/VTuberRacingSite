[2:12:27] gravitypriest: I'm still catching up on it being in vogue to call -yourself- a weeaboo
[2:12:49] Delsin7Pony: a chinchilla drawing a chinchilla, but is the second chinchilla drawing a chinchilla?
[2:12:52] Doomgel: I'm just playing. Although I would say that I like some aspects of idol stuff, but certianly not al of it
[2:12:55] gravitypriest: yeah it is probably a younger gen thing
[2:13:02] MizuchiVT: absolutely
[2:13:08] StarGirlGreen: @Delsin7Pony now im questioning that !!!
[2:13:08] niertlwal: i think anime is more mainstream, hell i think there was a football player who was wearing a naruto headband in an interview
[2:13:09] Returner7: yeah def in vogue for the current generation to "like anime"
[2:13:13] niertlwal: which was insanely funny
[2:13:17] demon_dandy: i think its just cause any ingroup eventually gets self aware with age, weaboo became an acceptable term
[2:13:35] HarrisonFjord: demon slayer vol 1 was the best selling comic book in america in 2020 iirc
[2:13:42] MizuchiVT: I'm an otaku not a weeaboo *pushes glasses up, breathes heavily* /s
[2:13:44] ph0sphorus7: That like saying I like marvel but you really mean I like the movies not the comics
[2:14:12] gravitypriest: none viz is like the most profitable publisher lol
[2:14:13] Doomgel: well with the recent run of rubbish comics, yeah manga destroys the industry

[3:25:13] kawaiicrew4ever: i thought it was more the little bro lmao he carried the movie for me

[3:27:27] breakerj912: But it is indeed a beautiful looking movie
[3:27:44] Senoquese: if a 3d movie gets water on my clothes i am immediately leaving a bad review on rottentomatoes
[3:28:12] Returner7: dude the people on the local news were saying the 3d in the first Avatar was soo lifelike that folks didn't want to go back to reality LMAO!
[3:28:36] Doomgel: @Returner7 I mean, it was cool, but it wasn't that cool
[3:28:45] Senoquese: pointy nails are always cute
