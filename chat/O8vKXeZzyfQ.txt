[1:55:08] cho__aniki: GameCube can't handle Ashton's power
[1:55:08] JTBun: thats a secret area you are meant to see
[1:55:10] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:55:13] Senoquese: try either direct3d 12 or vulkan but besides that theres not really much you can change

[2:00:38] RobotFaker: I'm saying it sucks so you don't feel bad for not playing it(?
[2:00:39] demon_dandy: this is all your fault, pitcrew reading this..

[2:05:16] ArthurWar: I've never had it be *this* slow
[2:05:17] Senoquese: @Kitkattack its not that popular
[2:05:19] RobotFaker: Ashton just talk really slowly so it seems like it's meant to be like this

[2:05:23] tomookouroki: chinchihappi
[2:05:38] abelsa02: are you on 4x resolution or something lol
[2:05:38] Kitkattack: @Senoquese compared to other gamecube games I mean

[2:05:40] MelvinSoupreme: this was a gamecube release game
[2:05:40] rikkaonline: shes gonna whip out an actual gamecube

[2:05:56] tomookouroki: 3d allstars goat...
[2:06:08] Senoquese: @Kitkattack yeah even with that taken in consideration, sunshine is one of the games thats notorious for natively not being 100% well emulated
[2:06:40] RedOniVA: I've never heard that before, but seeing this I guess I can understand now.
[2:06:48] mushi_buns: yippy!!!!

[2:07:22] ApocalypseSC: ashton51Dance ashton51Dance ashton51Dance
[2:07:24] xivandroid: like people have been emulating gamecube games pretty well for over a decade
[2:07:25] mushi_buns: sadge
[2:07:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: did you test the ashton version Before stream? so you could do all the right optimizations for it?
[2:07:33] Senoquese: @xivandroid yeah youd thinkk but its mostly smash melee
[2:07:55] deafmutelaughing: my conclusion is that nintendo is poopy
[2:07:55] yojamjam: i suspect 60fps was the killer here
[2:08:17] Senoquese: you can but the game wasnt even reaching 30 fps
[2:08:21] xivandroid: @Senoquese yeah but I've seen like a dozen vtubers stream sunshine and have no issues
[2:08:22] yojamjam: mario sunshine is a 30fps game anyhow
[2:08:33] Senoquese: changing the fps cap wouldnt *lower* the fps
[2:08:33] xivandroid: she was playing at 60fps?
[2:08:52] justchiken: I think the Ashbox64 is just a rebranded SouljaGame ashton51Sus
[2:09:01] yojamjam: yes but 60fps in sunshine is a hack, i am betting that was somehow the issue
[2:09:07] JTBun: it is
[2:09:09] RobotFaker: pour water on your pc it's thirsty that's why it's running slow
[2:09:09] rikkaonline: its an emulator so yes
[2:09:09] Kitkattack: I'm only familiar with PS1 and PS2 emu's
[2:09:10] tomookouroki: yes
[2:09:16] demon_dandy: dolphin is def one of those big projects
[2:09:17] rikkaonline: emulators in general arent for normies
[2:09:27] JaAmfan: @Senoquese isnt it via a gekko code? it's a gerryrig workaround that can break other things in the code
[2:09:28] Kitkattack: you do have to really like to tinker yeah
[2:09:29] xivandroid: @rikkaonline are you calling ashton a normie?
[2:09:44] aureliangates: ashton51Pathetic
[2:09:45] rikkaonline: @xivandroid ashton51Heh
[2:09:46] abelsa02: ashton51Love
[2:09:49] Senoquese: @JaAmfan ive tried both modded in and gecko code 60fps and its the same performance
[2:09:54] ahzree: 60fps or widescreen hack shouldnt be an issue lol
[2:10:09] demon_dandy: who the fuck is this? wheres super ashton fuuuuck im so pissed
[2:10:20] rikkaonline: omg the ost my favorite mario game
[2:10:27] mushi_buns: i will spare seno.. ashton51Stare
[2:10:32] ahzree: we're gaming now though
[2:10:33] RedOniVA: I still think this collection is sorta lackluster, but at least there's a way for modern audiences to play this without emulation.
[2:10:35] ahzree: ashton51Baby
[2:10:36] DavidPortnov: The random Italian is back.

[2:12:38] deafmutelaughing: there were not
[2:12:39] yojamjam: subs were turned off, og has them
[2:12:41] MelvinSoupreme: mario is basically on ice skates in this game he's very slippery
[2:13:05] deafmutelaughing: the _ button

[2:15:09] RobotFaker: oh my god was it always that senstive or is it just this version?
[2:15:19] buruhas: It'll be a good time in the platforming sections
[2:15:35] yojamjam: it's like this because no analog triggers
[2:15:42] ArthurWar: Stick sensitivity is an issue with a couple of the NSO apps too, the Gamecube one has it especially bad
[2:15:49] abelsa02: if you spin while shooting you can become a sprinkler doobyPeak
[2:15:57] MelvinSoupreme: the platforming levels in this game were really fun for me
[2:16:01] yojamjam: this port handles well with the gamecube adaptr
[2:16:03] RedOniVA: In the original, you switched between spraying on the move and spraying in place with the analog triggers.
