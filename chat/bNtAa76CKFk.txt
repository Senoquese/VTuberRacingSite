[5:41:51] AtrusHB: Only thing i didn't really like about this remake is that the character models and their animations don't really do justice to the FMV actors in the original 1997 game. I think that's mostly because they were trying to modify motion capture to match the og actors, because the the character animation fom some hidden new content is great by comparison

[5:47:12] AtrusHB: @vera_azure Yep, for the longest time even the steam versions of myst and riven required you to have quicktime installed to play them. It wasn't until scummvm added custom engines to support them that the quicktime requirement was dropped.
