[0:35:02] moush: smash is the black sheep
[0:35:04] mwukuro: theyre just elitist
[0:35:10] JTBun: like Streetfighter
[0:35:11] TheAsterite: it's cause smash players only play smash
[0:35:11] the_ol_regular: You know what?
[0:35:17] justcerebro: skullgirl is just a regular 2d fighter it's literally a marvel vs capcom clone
[0:35:17] TheAsterite: they hardly ever branch out
[0:35:17] SolAzul42: Because smash doesn't intentionally make their inputs difficult
[0:35:23] the_ol_regular: What about Them's Fighting Herds?
[0:35:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: smash is the black sheep in the sense that it has the 3rd largest purse size in tournaments

[0:36:25] KingHappywai: and i still turn them off
[0:36:26] SolAzul42: But yeah it's designed as a party game first and foremost, which puts it at odds with the competitive scene
[0:36:30] justcerebro: smash is a fighting game but it has no overlap with the usual fighting game community that's why people treat FGC and Smash community as separate entities ashton51Smile
