[1:46:46] Burr11: are they supposed to be eye bags or is it just to make their eyes look bigger
[1:47:03] insp_gadget: i think they want to make the eyes look bigger. through make up, like those cat eyes.
[1:47:27] horribleham: @rikkaonline I could go on a very impassioned rant about the de-fanging of gyarus for boring otaku that are scared of girls.
[1:47:30] Kitkattack: I do like that show, but there really is nothing gyaru about it
[1:47:45] Romblymo: So they draw a line under their eye basically. I keep seeing it as a second bottom eyebrow
[1:47:57] Burr11: i guess when i've seen jirai kei girls specifically drawn, the eye bags are actual eye bags and not hidden by the drawing style
[1:47:57] insp_gadget: also there's those that put make up on their eye bags to make them look less puffy
[1:48:14] shallows_: so what you are basically saying is that you see pretty girls in anime and reinterpret it to real life thru your own western beauty perspectives, when it actually comes from a different set of fashions and beauty trends in japan?

[2:28:25] HashiriyaR32: Could also be a crew issue.  Again, didn't take enough time to trouble shoot, and they may have forgotten to lower the landing gear for the 2nd landing attempt.
[2:28:30] Burr11: honestly if it was just a landing gear issue it shouldn't have led to that catastrophic of a landing
