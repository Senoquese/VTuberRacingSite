[2:47:14] yojamjam: fluddless levels are secretly the most fun part of the game
[2:47:37] ArthurWar: They kinda are because of how it forces you to learn all the tech
[2:47:48] Burr11: yeah usually, lol
[2:47:54] HmmHrmHarumph: yes, but that's what gives it character
[2:48:04] DerSeelander: This mod is mega cute
[2:48:06] metaconstruct: cute sunflowers..
[2:48:08] demon_dandy: It helps that flud is kinda fun tbf
[2:48:27] yojamjam: fludd really is the weakest part of sunshine, playing this game with sm64 longjump solidified this opinion for me
[2:48:33] rikkaonline: nintendo is so good at making games sometimes that they need to handicap themselves
[2:48:38] HmmHrmHarumph: if Mario Sunshine were good it wouldn't be good anymore, you feel?
[2:49:02] TheRATifier1: Do fan games count?
[2:49:07] rikkaonline: the motion controls really ruined skyward sword imo
[2:49:18] pogotross: om
[2:49:29] rikkaonline: oot is just 3d lttp
[2:49:37] DerSeelander: Does being able to climb objects in Borderlands 3 vs 2 count?
[2:49:37] FrostbyteTigressa: Hi Chilla
[2:49:40] Senoquese: some ppl can argue portal 2s story is worse but every single gameplay addition was for the better imo
[2:49:42] pantalaimon91: I can appreciate trying new features but sometimes they just aren't as interesting as they were in concept
[2:49:48] yojamjam: twilight princess's gimmick was the wolf which left basically no impression
[2:49:56] rikkaonline: 3 dungeons, dark world, 6 dungeons
[2:50:01] demon_dandy: Tbf the "gimmick" of oot didnt really stat since the ocarina goes away
[2:50:04] ArthurWar: We were using the Twilight Princess character designs for a long time after, Brawl and Smash 4 both used them
[2:50:12] demon_dandy: stay*

[2:51:06] HmmHrmHarumph: Fi is better than Navi at least
[2:51:09] rikkaonline: marin my beloved
[2:51:13] Juris_Est: Fi was boring and annoying
[2:51:22] Juris_Est: I hated the harp, as well
[2:51:36] ArthurWar: People also hated Wind Waker when it first came out so the worm does turn lol
[2:51:39] TheAsterite: tatl or navi? there's only 1 choice

[5:01:15] kienergy_: hi ashton
[5:01:26] linkykos: Henlo AshtonMarten!! amaiumLove hayami1Patpat
[5:01:29] Kitkattack: it's Christmas in July!
[5:01:34] horribleham: hi raiders!
[5:01:41] Amai_Umimaru: No go off queen amaiumShy
[5:01:42] pogotross: time to talk about politics and religion!
[5:01:49] KayAlamode: real talk tho, you're a good friend and an empathetic person asthon and that's a good thing ashton51Love
[5:01:51] pantalaimon91: We're doing drama dives in here. It's fun
[5:01:56] Senoquese: yeahh the vtuber drama, ashton tweeted that ashtons streams are shitty which is like??? we really got haters like that??
[5:02:00] bonatide: She was a half chuuba from the start anyway
[5:02:31] linkykos: lilyhoSip
[5:02:32] demon_dandy: Same tbh LOL
[5:02:34] Kitkattack: who is this motherfucker
[5:02:42] Kitkattack: you've mentioned him like three times
[5:02:47] Senoquese: i dont care about the definition of being a vtuber but hes a straight up shitty person
[5:02:51] deafmutelaughing: I never heard of him before last week
[5:02:53] Senoquese: like the clip of him saying the slur lol
[5:02:53] Juris_Est: The peanut dipshit?
[5:02:59] czerno333: it was chill for me until i learned the guy is kind of a dickhead
[5:03:04] demon_dandy: He was nominated for tga too which is crazy
[5:03:05] KayAlamode: in a tizzy because Ashton was ROBBED
[5:03:07] JTBun: hes a bigot and a loser
[5:03:10] pogotross: he's one of those random streamers that jump to 40k overnight
[5:03:12] JTBun: so i hate him
[5:03:14] horribleham: Ashton should have won
[5:03:25] pantalaimon91: In my opinion, on the one hand he's an ass from everything I've seen, on the other the award doesn't matter and people should just move on
[5:03:27] HmmHrmHarumph: that guy spawned in a week ago to create some weird drama
[5:03:29] Kitkattack: oh what the hell he just plays shooters and rages
[5:03:30] agroedEagle: funny thing about peanut he only started streaming in 2025
[5:03:40] bonatide: Giving the award show that much credit is the real loss imo.
[5:03:41] Juris_Est: I've seen people saying he vehemently denies being a VTuber, and talks shit about them instead
[5:03:49] demon_dandy: I mean hes mainly big right now because of the game he plays
[5:03:57] Senoquese: his community voted him as a vtuber as a prank because of how often he spoke badly of vtubers
[5:04:02] cho__aniki: just bring back filian's vtuber awards or start another one, the twitch streamer awards are ran by an elitist clique that hates vtubers, vtuber culture, and vtuber supporters
[5:04:03] nykaorl: let's not forget it was hosted by people who actively resent vtubers
[5:04:35] Kitkattack: blow up the vga's
[5:04:36] KayAlamode: he said you're all 40 year old men using voice changers to sound like 14 year old girls
[5:04:37] Kitkattack: !bomb
[5:04:41] abysshunted: if QT resented  VTubers she would not have had Mouse give a musical number
[5:04:42] Senoquese: @KayAlamode this
[5:05:02] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[5:05:07] bonatide: Who cares is the correct opinion imo. Its a whatever "award" from a whatever show
[5:05:07] pogotross: @abysshunted QT wants to clout farm Peanut more than she cares about vtubers
[5:05:14] Amai_Umimaru: I literally did not know 99% of people at the awards so I didn't really care
[5:05:18] Kitkattack: tubers are the minority in the grand scheme of streaming
[5:05:19] agroedEagle: his Halo streams were peak
[5:05:36] Amai_Umimaru: But I don't enjoy watching people getting bullied/teased
[5:05:39] pogotross: om I feel like way too many people don't know QT's past on twitch
[5:05:42] Amai_Umimaru: even irl streamers were getting weird jokes
[5:05:53] Senoquese: we unfortunately do have care when the hate becomes this visible and impactful
[5:05:54] czerno333: it was really funny when John Hololive showed up
[5:05:55] Amai_Umimaru: Right everyone worked hard to get to where they are
[5:06:04] Senoquese: have to care*
[5:06:07] HmmHrmHarumph: award shows are so weird
[5:06:08] ArthurWar: Yeah, it was pretty mean-spirited for some reason
[5:06:10] KayAlamode: the overall vibe was "mean spirited"
[5:06:13] agroedEagle: the streamer awards were whatever twitchcon on the other hand was a shitshow
[5:06:14] demon_dandy: I cant dictate who calls themselves a vtuber ashton51Tehe but it is kind of a  "are you cool with the community" thing
[5:06:19] abysshunted: Best thing is just ignore the haters, keep doing your own thing, and let your own audience know you're awesome
[5:06:23] horribleham: horribleham gifted a Tier 3 sub to Amai_Umimaru! They have given 502 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[5:06:36] abysshunted: *come to know
[5:06:37] bonatide: If it was like an ironmouse award show and he won i think it would matter, but its tangential streamers making their own personal opinions known. Vtubing is its own thing
[5:06:37] deafmutelaughing: quite bothersome indeed
[5:06:47] Amai_Umimaru: ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy Thank you Hamu!
[5:06:51] Senoquese: you are so awshum ashton51Baby
[5:06:53] Kitkattack: ashton51Heyyy
[5:06:55] jherchin12345: yes
[5:06:55] KayAlamode: yes ashton51Blush
[5:06:58] ArthurWar: Yeah ashton51Love
[5:07:00] abysshunted: yeah!
[5:07:01] nomzoogles: ashton i dont think ur awesome. I think ur Epic.
[5:07:03] InsaneLoke: stream cutout right before you said awesome, thought that was funny
[5:07:24] Senoquese: the problem is those streamers are like 10x larger and more present in normie media than any vtuber could wish to be
[5:07:28] horribleham: one at a time or all at once?
[5:07:31] demon_dandy: glorp your awesum and ashton afff
[5:07:33] Senoquese: this WILL affect the average persons view on vtuber
[5:07:39] abysshunted: Also the award show isn't decided by the hosts. It's entirely viewer nominations and votes. It's not like the Game Awards.
[5:07:42] littleeclipse_: I just think if you yourself don’t identify as something “like peanut with being a Vtuber” then he shouldn’t be given the nomination of said thing despite him being one by definition
[5:08:03] Kitkattack: you know what they say about pineapples in the morning INSANECAT
[5:08:05] pingufrend: it sucks that it happens but its reassuring that normies wont enter the vtuber space and hijack it bc they cringe at it so much
[5:08:11] pogotross: @littleeclipse_ He wouldn't if he didn't have 40k ccv
[5:08:55] deafmutelaughing: "cringe is dead" mfs when they have to listen to their boomer coworkers discuss politics
[5:09:01] DerSeelander: Lol
[5:09:06] nomzoogles: i wonder where it stems from because its so out of nowhere!
[5:09:07] Amai_Umimaru: Whenever I hear "that's a 40 yo man being a cute girl" it sounds so old
[5:09:12] VodkusLT: you sound agresive vtuber
[5:09:17] demon_dandy: Yeaahhhh ashton51Tehe
[5:09:19] Juris_Est: Yea, that's the meme that has breached containment into normie circles
[5:09:19] Amai_Umimaru: The people that say that sound so old
[5:09:29] agroedEagle: for me the issue was i always thought vtubers were always just goonerbate but many are good artists and singers  which made me change my mind
[5:09:32] Juris_Est: And is taken as fact
[5:09:34] Senoquese: yeahhh
[5:09:39] czerno333: yeah it's literally just the same thing but redirected
[5:09:40] deafmutelaughing: the 40 year old man bit just reminds me of that baalbuddy comic
[5:09:47] horribleham: let that 40 year old be a cute girl!
[5:09:48] Amai_Umimaru: shounen anime is mainstream amaiumACTUALLY
[5:09:54] horribleham: god forbid people have fun
[5:09:58] nomzoogles: vtubers are diddyblud media off limits
[5:10:02] pogotross: @Amai_Umimaru yeah, it's like "there are no girls on the internet" from the 90's
[5:10:09] abysshunted: You have to like Shonen and anime Attack on Titan, though (I hate it)
[5:10:19] czerno333: the psychology of it all is very strange
[5:10:24] Juris_Est: @nomzoogles wtf are you even saying
[5:10:25] DerSeelander: Kids on the playground pretending to be streamers
[5:10:30] pantalaimon91: Anime is just shy of mainstream and has been relegated to where animation in general in the west has been for a very long time. For kids and cringe to like as an adult.
[5:10:32] Stellar_Fox1: sometimes i forget how much stuff normies consider cringe and completely off limits
[5:10:35] bonatide: "Anime" is fine but otaku culture isnt. Decultured souless anime is the only thing the main stream will accept
[5:10:38] pogotross: om ball and gun ass anime
[5:10:54] nomzoogles: @Juris_Est i jest from the pov of the haters cause it does feel like thats the perception to some degree
[5:10:59] bonatide: Niche cultures will never be qccepted
[5:11:08] agroedEagle: id say anime is in a fine place, many of those gym guys have brand of sacrifice tattoos that its a stereotype at this point
[5:11:16] horribleham: Someone needs to get that art of the soldier taking a bunch of knives and grenades for the kid and slap 'furries' and 'vtubers' on it.
[5:11:17] richiexiii: @bonatide True.
[5:11:25] richiexiii: Also, hi Ashton. Hi Pitcrew. o/
[5:11:36] pogotross: Hey now don't bring my isekai slop into this
[5:11:47] Juris_Est: I enjoy a spoonful of isekai slop every so often limesShrug
[5:11:52] bonatide: Imagine telling a normie you like lucky star
[5:12:14] jherchin12345: yeah its a very similar feeling
[5:12:21] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[5:12:33] Senoquese: it is kinda scary how only one or two really popular people can completely affect a huge chunk of a community for this long, the power to direct people to bully others like that
[5:12:36] GManx0: You now get gatekeepers and normies beating you up
[5:12:47] pantalaimon91: It feels bad to feel like we have to hang out back in the closet with all the other "unacceptable" things.
[5:12:48] richiexiii: "Normal is when you get to know them. Everybody's crazy." -- Michael Bolton, 1985.
[5:13:01] ArthurWar: This mission is very obtuse
[5:13:04] deafmutelaughing: just a normal tuesday am I right
[5:13:04] littleeclipse_: Peanut literally wanted to win to “own the Vtubers”
[5:13:10] demon_dandy: Even anime is like, you gotta fight wannabe tastemakers and normies
[5:13:16] abysshunted: "water damage in the restroom" is the hint you need
[5:13:25] pogotross: Stare just turn the knob
[5:13:42] InsaneLoke: mario:
[5:13:43] horribleham: My friends used to be vtuber hates until I started openly enjoying.
[5:13:46] pogotross: om wait I didn't know you could turn the knob
[5:13:58] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[5:14:15] DerSeelander: I used to pretend play DBZ with my friends in primary school but I remember some girl telling me the powerpuff girls could beat goku in a fight
[5:14:18] horribleham: this really is the resident evil of mario
[5:14:25] KayAlamode: good night ashton. I know you never see the chats where I praise and only when I am being a bully, but you are a very talented entertainer and I look forward to your donothon
[5:14:31] abysshunted: what you need to do is in the restroom, not from outside
[5:14:37] littleeclipse_: @Blaisevtch That’s why I don’t like community voted things but idk how you’d do a streamer award without it
[5:14:42] demon_dandy: Night kay ashton51Wave
[5:14:42] pogotross: @DerSeelander did you shoot your kamehameha into the sky or did you not TRUELY BELIEVE
[5:14:46] Senoquese: LOL
[5:14:47] deafmutelaughing: @DerSeelander nowadays we have powerscaling wikis for these types of arguments
[5:14:52] Senoquese: we all know how that feels ashton51ICANT
[5:14:53] jherchin12345: om
[5:15:00] GManx0: They are just like me fr fr
[5:15:03] KayAlamode: ashton51Love
[5:15:35] ArthurWar: They really do throw you in on this one and say "figure it out buddy"
[5:15:37] pogotross: DinkDonk DEVS DinkDonk DEVS DinkDonk WE NEED YELLOW PAINT
[5:15:39] DarkSilverW338: Look for the yellow paint Kappa
[5:15:44] abysshunted: last hint: what you need to do is inside the restroom
[5:15:45] deafmutelaughing: haha more like the steamer awards. like poopy
[5:16:00] Erjoc: We need a giant crazy taxi arrow in the sky
[5:16:07] horribleham: the past 500 chats: "Ashton, you really make my life better for being in it, you are so good at what you do." the last chat you sent: "Lol fumbled." Guess which one she notices ashton51Despair
[5:16:14] Senoquese: @abysshunted oh oh "what is poop". do i win
[5:16:36] horribleham: we need to gamble
[5:16:40] pogotross: @horribleham she just sees the truth and ignores the lies Clueless
[5:16:47] littleeclipse_: @Blaisevtch Yeahhh you right about that
[5:16:53] ArthurWar: LOL
[5:16:55] Senoquese: LOL
[5:16:55] pogotross: oh this is easy: if XQC is involved don't care
[5:16:55] demon_dandy: LOL
[5:16:56] metaconstruct: huhhhh
[5:16:57] horribleham: whoaaaaa
[5:16:58] deafmutelaughing: it does end up working out
[5:17:02] Senoquese: stupid fucking game ashton51ICANT
[5:17:07] nomzoogles: i feel like for stuff like this feeling apathetic is a pretty big virtue
[5:17:09] yojamjam: this fucking level lol
[5:17:15] InsaneLoke: tuah
[5:17:19] DarkSilverW338: welcome to la-mulana
[5:17:23] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[5:17:25] horribleham: PFT
[5:17:26] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[5:17:29] nomzoogles: LOL
[5:17:33] bonatide: The ultimate question is do pekple i like respect me/agree with me imo
[5:17:39] pantalaimon91: It's better to be measured and take your time thinking of what to say rather than firing from the hilt. If it comes off as apathetic so be it.
[5:17:41] bonatide: The periphery can be ignored
[5:18:01] InsaneLoke: wasnt the shine in there
[5:18:14] Senoquese: i agree but at the same time not speaking up can invite people to assume whatever they want yeah
[5:18:27] InsaneLoke: sorry!
[5:18:32] Senoquese: anything can be a dogwhistle if youre looking for it, and those people certainly are
[5:19:12] deafmutelaughing: what do you mean by reactionary because my understanding is that means you have conservative politics and a disdain of modern culture
[5:19:22] horribleham: just giving mario a concision lolol
[5:19:27] horribleham: OOO THE DOORS
[5:19:30] horribleham: so cool
[5:19:33] DerSeelander: Do you find time to watch anime any more as an adult?
[5:19:46] horribleham: I never got to this level because I didn't beat the mantas
[5:20:03] deafmutelaughing: or like social progress specifically
[5:20:18] abysshunted: this is one of the 50 mandatory shines
[5:20:34] horribleham: ew, I hate their tails
[5:20:39] horribleham: :3
[5:20:40] yojamjam: i think sunshine has a super high rate of childhood dnf
[5:20:43] horribleham: naur
[5:20:51] demon_dandy: @deafmutelaughing i think she just means in the literal sense of having an outward reaction
[5:20:55] metaconstruct: tldr you can just not engage with bad faith actors , i think thats fine, maybe even optimal
[5:21:41] Senoquese: just unfortunate that more often than not ive seen people that take silence or inaction as "theyre totally on my side but they want to appease the crowd"
[5:21:42] horribleham: the stoic streamer knows not to react when mario goes 'wahoo!'
[5:21:50] bonatide: People trying to make anime mainstream will always have to equivocate. Trying to keep the culture what it is will always be niche
[5:21:50] Amai_Umimaru: she's a yapper!
[5:21:54] demon_dandy: Im gonna be mad if you delist this ashton
[5:22:23] deafmutelaughing: lost ashton media
[5:22:29] pantalaimon91: The camera angles in the rooms are abysmal man
[5:22:29] richiexiii: YLB

[5:22:41] demon_dandy: Ig thats fine ashton51Tehe but you got some epic wins
[5:22:46] InsaneLoke: no deleting parts of game series
[5:22:47] Erjoc: Yapton marten at it again
[5:23:20] horribleham: you broke his poster!
[5:23:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: leave the vod up please I missed the first part cuz I had to do a bunch of errands
[5:23:27] DerSeelander: You should restrict embarassing VODs to tier 3 members lmao

[5:25:36] Kitkattack: I meant both yeah, to eat or like the look of

[5:26:33] agroedEagle: have you been able to do yoshis juice fountain move yet?

[5:26:46] czerno333: @Kitkattack yeah the enzymes in the pineapple are burning your mouth
[5:26:48] abysshunted: mango is actually in the poison ivy family
[5:26:52] metaconstruct: yea its too much
[5:26:58] pantalaimon91: I only like cooked pineapple, like on pizza
[5:26:59] Erjoc: Pineapple enzymes are spooky.
[5:27:11] horribleham: I will win
[5:27:11] DerSeelander: I'm going to wager you don't like kiwi either because it burns?
[5:27:14] bonatide: Andddddddd dropped
[5:27:15] demon_dandy: Can you get in the other vents with yoshi?
[5:27:15] czerno333: i think it is literally like a digestive enzyme, like in animal stomachs that's what it gets used for
[5:27:25] bonatide: Pineapple my goats got shooters
[5:27:30] Erjoc: I made a pork roast with raw pineapple once and the whole thing turned to goo
[5:27:33] agroedEagle: ashton are you a carnivore?

[5:27:52] used_sock1: elisHmm
[5:27:59] Senoquese: salmone,,,
[5:28:04] tub_of_bingus: i take the burning sensation of pineapple as a challenge: i assert dominance by eating it faster than it can consume me
[5:28:19] demon_dandy: Oh my god the nl clip about the guy feeding him a piece of mango Flirt
[5:28:24] pantalaimon91: Aren't chinchillas vegetarians?
[5:28:30] Senoquese: i think youre done with this path now that you have yoshi
[5:28:33] czerno333: cutting kiwis in half and eating the halves with a spoon has always been the method
[5:28:37] metaconstruct: yes but not martens
[5:28:40] abysshunted: Get another pineapple, get yoshi again, then go to the noki swingers
[5:28:41] used_sock1: you use yoshi to eat the ghosts
[5:28:43] yojamjam: take yoshi up to the ceiling maze he can eat the ghosts
[5:28:50] DerSeelander: You remind me of asmongold having to chase down healthy water with soda lmao
[5:28:52] demon_dandy: You just eat the ghosts
[5:28:57] horribleham: a REAL meat eater!

[5:29:41] bonatide: Did you clear the chomplet level? I zoned out
[5:29:44] pantalaimon91: So the chilla only contributes to being fluffy and adorable in a way different to the marten I guess
