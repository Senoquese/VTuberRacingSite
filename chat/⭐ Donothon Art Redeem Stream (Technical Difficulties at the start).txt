[1:11:26] rikkaonline: i thought it was just that SA didnt like anime much
[1:11:29] rikobutepic: Haruhi.
[1:11:33] vtuberacingcorp: It was before either of those!
[1:11:39] rikkaonline: haruhi is after 4chan
[1:11:42] Senoquese: nuh uh thats a chinchilla eating sand
[1:11:54] Navy_Mongoose: FMA came out in 2003 maybe that?
[1:11:56] rikobutepic: Bing chalingchilla
[1:11:58] Returner7: I think it was School Rumble that killed one of the big fan subbers
[1:11:59] demon_dandy: Maybe just azumanga lmao

[1:12:16] Navy_Mongoose: oh that makes a lot of sense
[1:12:17] Senoquese: azumanga lmaooo

[1:12:22] Burr11: yeah azumanga
[1:12:39] Senoquese: remember that fucked up azumanga meme we saw that turned out to be from like 2009 LMAO
[1:12:45] Navy_Mongoose: or DiGi Charat, since moot was a catgirl
[1:13:07] rikkaonline: azumanga is the seinfeld of anime
[1:13:12] demon_dandy: LMAO osaka slideshow
[1:13:32] Burr11: i felt lucky star was the seinfeld of anime
[1:13:41] Navy_Mongoose: what about Yotsuba&? Yotsuba did become the mascot
[1:13:43] Burr11: lot of observational humor
[1:13:52] anonsama9001: kagami best lucky star btw
[1:14:15] Burr11: or maybe you made up the english lyrics?
[1:14:22] Returner7: look, ppl like Seinfeld because it was one of the first of the genre, and I suppose Azumanga was also one of the firsts of the genre
[1:14:39] demon_dandy: I mean both are still real funny
[1:14:57] Burr11: i like konata
[1:14:57] Returner7: eh I don't really care much for Seinfeld
[1:14:59] rikkaonline: theyre both hugely influential on everything that followed
[1:15:00] vtuberacingcorp: Seems like the actual reason 4chan was founded was because 2ch blocked non-JP IPs. The Something Awful subboard had been big into 2ch, so moot forked it and made 3chan.
[1:15:10] vtuberacingcorp: *and made 4chan.
[1:15:11] rikkaonline: to the point where people dont even notice much of the influence
[1:15:44] Navy_Mongoose: SA was still banning all anime
[1:15:48] rikkaonline: azu and seinfeld
[1:16:05] TheAsterite: friends
[1:16:07] rikkaonline: literally every sitcom is
[1:16:10] TheAsterite: it's like the anti-friends
[1:16:24] rikkaonline: its like asking if a rock band is influenced by the beatles
[1:16:34] Burr11: it always bugs me when people dont like seinfeld but like stuff that borrows so much from it lol
[1:16:45] vtuberacingcorp: I don't think they banned anime, supposedly they banned Hentai.
[1:16:58] Senoquese: always sunny is goated
[1:17:06] Navy_Mongoose: I think Seinfeld holds up
[1:17:22] demon_dandy: I think even if you dont find it directly funny, i think something about old men whining about extremely menial thinga is funny
[1:17:46] rikkaonline: thats the trope - people that watch seinfeld today find it unoriginal, because theyre used to the tropes it invented permeating modern tv
[1:18:18] Burr11: seinfeld's callbacks are so good.. it's funny how the plotlines all intermingle by the end
[1:18:19] vtuberacingcorp: The more I did into it the more it was a very complex, multi-faceted reasoning. As with all histories.
[1:18:35] demon_dandy: That too burr
[1:18:45] fookengrooven: U have 6 fingers?
[1:18:59] Navy_Mongoose: Just ask yourself, is it funny to see men trying to wear a bra? This joke was in Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys and the answer is yes

[1:20:05] demon_dandy: Its funny he complains about the bagel place ninoegWHATTHE its like cosmically funny i swearrre
[1:20:14] TheAsterite: i think malcom in the middle was one of the first sitcoms to be filmed cinema style instead of like, sitcom style
[1:20:30] Zerorush: The only sitcom adjacent things I can remember watching and enjoying were Scrubs, Always Sunny, and Community
[1:20:43] demon_dandy: Yeah malcolm in the middle is probably the progenitor for sitco s like always sunny
