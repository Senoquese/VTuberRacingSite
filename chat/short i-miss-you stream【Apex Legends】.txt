[0:39:52] demon_dandy: what you think of the new character? ashton51Tensai
[0:39:57] cable_vt: idk if you can do it in game but you can add it as a launch option
[0:40:08] Returner7: video -> adaptive resolution -> 60fps
[0:40:18] Kitkattack: I wasn't gonna talk you down from the strimm but it's not a great idea to get hammered just after being sick
[0:40:22] demon_dandy: yeah her kit seems pretty niche or specific to indoors
[0:40:51] Returner7: uh oh
[0:40:57] cable_vt: as a launch option you can do "+fps_max 60" (sans quotes) and it'll lock you to 60 without messing with your resolution
[0:41:31] cable_vt: yeah, steam launch options in properties
[0:41:35] cable_vt: if you want help after i got you LOL
[0:41:41] anthechamp8932: qu ik
