[2:01:07] Fireflye645: It's a dick move but you cannot blame him

[2:09:24] Navy_Mongoose: RE2 is the best
[2:09:26] Kitkattack: or or ro Silent Hill
[2:09:38] Kitkattack: I love love love Silent Hill 2 OG
[2:09:42] the_ol_regular: Silent on deez Hills
[2:09:44] demon_dandy: Re2 did get a remake LMAO but its different
[2:09:45] katsuragi_kakeruvt: didnt RE2 get like a super remake
[2:09:54] ScholarofGames: I'd recommend OG of each game.
[2:09:55] Kitkattack: yes and no
[2:09:55] the_ol_regular: Uh, yah chat
[2:10:02] the_ol_regular: That's what a remake is
[2:10:02] yojamjam: definitely og for sh2
[2:10:06] ScholarofGames: Silent Hill 2 is stand alone.
[2:10:11] fsteakk: 2 is standalone
[2:10:19] deathtopaulw: 3 is a direct sequel to 1, so you can play 2 alone
[2:10:25] Kitkattack: Silent hill games are chronological except for 2
[2:10:29] ScholarofGames: And honestly you could do either or for Silent Hill 2, the remake is amazing.
[2:10:31] Fireflye645: IIRC there isn't anything about 1 in 2.
[2:10:31] the_ol_regular: What chat is saying
[2:10:34] ScholarofGames: Still recommend the OG though.
[2:10:40] demon_dandy: The remake for sh2 i hear is real nice
[2:10:43] the_ol_regular: I haven't played Silent Hill 2 yet but I know that much
[2:10:50] ScholarofGames: There is
[2:10:52] the_ol_regular: Resi 2 remake yes
[2:10:52] demon_dandy: Its different
[2:10:57] Fireflye645: There is a remake but it's very different
[2:11:00] the_ol_regular: They have the same DNA
[2:11:02] Navy_Mongoose: there is, but it plays vastly differently
[2:11:02] 0NIB0: nah it's third person only
[2:11:03] Noworksm: RE 1-4 all have remakes
[2:11:03] ScholarofGames: They are very different
[2:11:04] katsuragi_kakeruvt: there is a completely updated version of RE2
[2:11:09] demon_dandy: Re2 remake i really love but its quite different
[2:11:13] deathtopaulw: nothing beats RE1 remake's feeling
[2:11:13] FranzNF: RE2 remake changes things somewhat heavily
[2:11:22] WhompingWalrus: Still good though.  RE3 remake is where it gets dicey...
[2:11:23] the_ol_regular: You know what chat?
[2:11:25] Fireflye645: RE2 classic is more like this than the RE2make is
[2:11:25] ScholarofGames: More so that I really suggest you just play OG RE2 first.
[2:11:26] demon_dandy: :tf:
[2:11:34] the_ol_regular: Ash should decide
[2:11:41] 0NIB0: there might be a fixed camera mod for RE2 remake? if i remember correctly
[2:11:51] Navy_Mongoose: RE1 and REmake are both fixed camera, RE2 is fixed camera, and REmake 2 is over the shoulder like Dead Space
[2:11:52] demon_dandy: Id love that
[2:11:56] the_ol_regular: @0nib0 yes actually
[2:12:08] katsuragi_kakeruvt: ashi press the square button, listen to the voices
[2:12:10] the_ol_regular: There you go chat, Ash likes tank controls
[2:12:19] Fireflye645: We love tnak controls
[2:12:37] Navy_Mongoose: this part pisses me off
[2:12:39] the_ol_regular: But yes you can play OG Resi 2 if you'd like
[2:12:41] demon_dandy: I do vouch for re2 remake as a fan of both og and new but i think you might prefer og
[2:12:50] the_ol_regular: Even tho the remake is great on it's own
[2:12:53] ScholarofGames: There are a few things about RE2R that makes me try to steer people toward the OG.
[2:13:06] Fireflye645: @demon_dandy RE2 remake is still REALLY good yeah
[2:13:18] the_ol_regular: Brb
[2:13:26] demon_dandy: NICE
[2:13:36] ScholarofGames: @Fireflye645 Very good, I'm just a bit of a grump old fart due to some of it's changes and short comings.
[2:13:55] the_ol_regular: Now how about that
[2:13:57] demon_dandy: Its funny theres percentages for when zombies grab you for the bomb exploding iirc ashton51Omegalul
[2:14:18] the_ol_regular: Aight, I was wrong, the crickets do stop spawning
[2:14:28] Navy_Mongoose: might be wrong, but the bug dudes endlessly spawn on Normal difficulty
[2:14:29] Fireflye645: Yeah if you run for a couple of steps you just explode it's great
[2:14:40] the_ol_regular: @navy_mongoose o rly?
[2:14:41] Fireflye645: @Navy_Mongoose Wrong there's just a lot

[2:15:25] the_ol_regular: I dunno, I never went as far to run
[2:15:29] Fireflye645: IIRC it shows the mansion and then it explodes
[2:15:30] demon_dandy: Its like an explosion mp4
[2:15:50] the_ol_regular: Dang Jill/Chris really blew up
[2:16:02] Navy_Mongoose: I learned by getting hit, and learned again by firing the grenade launcher

[2:50:51] Navy_Mongoose: @rikoremade clothes are in the wash
[2:51:05] the_ol_regular: Y'all act like humans are born with clothes
[2:51:14] rikobutepic: the heartbeat is pretty freaky
[2:51:27] ScholarofGames: Wait, Tyrant just backhands Wesker in this?
[2:51:37] demon_dandy: Flirt
[2:51:44] the_ol_regular: *Leon OG Resi 4 death sound*
[2:51:53] ScholarofGames: @the_ol_regular A classic
[2:51:54] FranzNF: @ScholarofGames yeah, but Barry shot him twice with the 45
[2:52:10] ScholarofGames: @FranzNF Pfh I prefer the OG.
[2:52:14] the_ol_regular: About that Ash
[2:52:20] Navy_Mongoose: @FranzNF I think he means in comparison to what he does to Wesker in the OG
[2:52:44] FranzNF: yeah i know but you could assume he should be death anyways
[2:52:47] FranzNF: also, no
[2:52:47] Navy_Mongoose: no, I won't tell you
[2:52:49] the_ol_regular: Has any chilla said that Lisa is new to the remake and didn't exist in the OG?
[2:53:05] ScholarofGames: No was saving that for the end of the run.
[2:53:24] the_ol_regular: Crimson Heads are new to the remake as well
[2:53:28] Navy_Mongoose: yes, the Trevor family stuff wasn't in the OG
[2:53:31] ScholarofGames: Which since this is the end may as well talk about it.
[2:53:41] the_ol_regular: Clueless
[2:53:43] heeropatv2: Trevor was in the original but they expanded on their family in the remake
[2:53:48] heeropatv2: he built the mansion
[2:53:48] Navy_Mongoose: you have plenty of time
[2:54:02] the_ol_regular: KEKW
[2:54:25] the_ol_regular: You got 3 minutes before Namek explodes
[2:54:26] FranzNF: the times goes on the fight only lol
[2:54:46] Navy_Mongoose: in the OG the 3 minute timer runs during cutscenes and elevator ride, leaving you with about 1 minute to do the actualy fight
[2:54:49] ScholarofGames: Honestly it annoys me because it's kind of hamfisted with how they did it.
[2:54:57] the_ol_regular: @Navy_Mongoose Now how about that
[2:55:08] the_ol_regular: @ScholarofGames Nah I like Lisa's inclusion
[2:55:16] FranzNF: wdym if you don't pick up Chris he will be stuck on the lab forever
[2:55:34] Fireflye645: She had a tummy ache!
[2:55:34] the_ol_regular: There is a strat for the stairs tho
[2:56:21] the_ol_regular: He got motivated

[2:57:21] katsuragi_kakeruvt: sleep is peak human behavior
[2:57:31] FranzNF: i'll touch that dent, just watch me

[3:04:41] RycegoZ: Chris is too dumb to 2 time

[3:05:12] Fireflye645: Less than 13 hours!!!!!!
[3:05:16] the_ol_regular: 13 hours!!!!
[3:05:20] Navy_Mongoose: Middle is Easy
[3:05:21] Fireflye645: "Or higher" Ashten

[3:05:53] the_ol_regular: 13 hours is long tho
[3:06:00] katsuragi_kakeruvt: its long for me....
[3:06:03] the_ol_regular: But yes, Chris has a different story
[3:06:03] ScholarofGames: Eh first time, not to bad.
[3:06:05] katsuragi_kakeruvt: ashton51Despair
[3:06:07] 0NIB0: you can easily beat them in a few hours
[3:06:12] demon_dandy: We were tellin you last night we were bein serious LMAO
[3:06:14] RycegoZ: The fact you kept Chris and Barry alive is an accomplishment you should be proud of
[3:06:16] Fireflye645: 8-14 hours is pretty average time for first playthroughs on these games
[3:06:20] the_ol_regular: What Ryce said
[3:06:22] Burr11: you got the bad end.. need to replay for the good one
[3:06:41] Navy_Mongoose: no, that was Jill's best ending
[3:06:43] the_ol_regular: I was scared Ash was gonna forget about Chris during the end
[3:06:55] the_ol_regular: Resi 1 has some slightly different endings
[3:07:07] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:07:11] Fireflye645: Well she has different content, Barry isn't in Chris' run
[3:07:17] Navy_Mongoose: Barry doesn't exist in Chris' campaign though, likewise Rebecca doesn't exist in Jill's
[3:07:23] RycegoZ: Mama Marten too busy worrying about you to sleep
[3:07:31] FranzNF: 11/13 is in fact 80% so we weren't lying tho
[3:07:32] ScholarofGames: I believe so?
[3:07:32] the_ol_regular: Hmmm
[3:07:33] the_ol_regular: I think so
[3:07:35] metaconstruct: holy crap did i miss it
[3:07:36] Fireflye645: You can
[3:07:42] demon_dandy: Should be able to
[3:07:50] the_ol_regular: Chris and Jill have different companions
[3:07:51] metaconstruct: ashton51OGEY ashton51OGEY ashton51OGEY ashton51OGEY
[3:07:57] Reserted: silly ending with silly ashy
[3:08:04] demon_dandy: Thats for re2 ashton51Tensai
[3:08:09] ScholarofGames: That doesn't really get expanded till later.
[3:08:11] RycegoZ: Yes

[4:15:00] RycegoZ: 99% of Ashton Martens end the stream before they beat the game
[4:15:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: SO what you think of the ending?
[4:15:05] InsaneLoke: so, RE2?
[4:15:18] the_ol_regular: @InsaneLoke Spoilers!!! (joking)
[4:15:18] Kitkattack: you seemed really really into the gameplay loop/style
[4:15:25] Kitkattack: you'd adore the Silent HIll games
[4:15:27] InsaneLoke: i just hope you wont wait till next october
[4:15:28] FranzNF: Fatal Frame next
[4:15:45] the_ol_regular: Dino Crisis even?
[4:15:48] RycegoZ: Ashton would've love P.T. (RIP)
[4:15:48] Kitkattack: I'm so here for this arc
[4:15:50] InsaneLoke: you like puzzles, most good puzzle games are also horror
[4:15:55] the_ol_regular: (Evil Within)
[4:15:58] Fireflye645: Fatal Frame is so so so SO scary dude
[4:16:00] Navy_Mongoose: puzzles and adventure with zombies
[4:16:10] InsaneLoke: go ahead, as long as its cold
[4:16:12] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they are retro
[4:16:13] InsaneLoke: outside
[4:16:14] mrp0p1nfr3sh: so why not
[4:16:19] demon_dandy: Silent hill would be pretty great ashton51Tensai
[4:16:23] the_ol_regular: Horror racer
[4:16:24] ReyJaggy: Lots of retro horror games yes
[4:16:26] InsaneLoke: the aura
[4:16:32] FranzNF: honestly to me Fatal Frame shares many of the good stuff you like about RE1
[4:16:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Cuz then you breath and you see your breath and thats THE SPOOKIEST
[4:16:34] Navy_Mongoose: I'm gonna be wearing my Leon Kennedy hoodie for the next couple months, that's why
[4:16:47] the_ol_regular: Oh Navy
[4:16:48] demon_dandy: Are you gonna try dead rising again ?
[4:16:49] InsaneLoke: why?
[4:16:54] the_ol_regular: Not good idea
[4:16:57] Navy_Mongoose: yeah fuck 3
[4:16:59] the_ol_regular: Resi 3 has lore stuff
[4:17:01] demon_dandy: Re3 is pretty necessary
[4:17:06] Fireflye645: 3 and Code Veronica are both fun!
[4:17:06] ScholarofGames: OG 3 is good
[4:17:07] RycegoZ: RE3 Remake sucked, but still you have to play it
[4:17:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah you have lore stuff
[4:17:11] InsaneLoke: RE3 is like during 2 i thought
[4:17:12] Navy_Mongoose: jk, RE3 has issues, but definitely play it
[4:17:16] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You cant really skip much
[4:17:26] FranzNF: ngl, 2 to 4 kinda makes sense cause they connect a bit
[4:17:26] demon_dandy: Re3 remake was rough but the og was great
[4:17:30] the_ol_regular: You gots to do Resi 3
[4:17:34] InsaneLoke: well once youve started with 1, you have to go in order
[4:17:35] Senoquese: asking pitcrew what games to play in a franchise always ends up the same shit ICANT
[4:17:41] Fireflye645: You CAN skip to 4 but there's a lot in the earlier games
[4:17:42] ScholarofGames: Eh you can, RE4 kind of stands alone.
[4:17:44] ReyJaggy: re3 has the most iconic boss
[4:17:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They are probably same pitcrew who said dont play half life blue shift.
[4:17:51] FranzNF: Play RE0 before 2 tho
[4:17:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they stay disinforming
[4:17:55] the_ol_regular: What Rey said
[4:18:00] rikkaonline: you need to get a crt to truly appreciate the original quality
[4:18:01] heeropatv2: as long as you play it before 5 ig
[4:18:04] Fireflye645: @FranzNF ????
[4:18:11] ScholarofGames: They have clearer versions.
[4:18:17] InsaneLoke: if you play RE1, you might as well go in order. but if you just want to play one RE game, you could start with 4
[4:18:19] demon_dandy: Stick to the numbered games for now ashton51Tehe
[4:18:21] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah idk why they said play rezero before 2
[4:18:23] the_ol_regular: Sowwy Ash, you gotta play them in order
[4:18:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: play in ordered
[4:18:46] Fireflye645: GOG has RE2 classic so that's nice
[4:18:46] RycegoZ: You have to play Code Veronica after 3, you'll love it
[4:18:50] the_ol_regular: Resi 0 is before 1 but ya know, Resi 2 is amazing
[4:19:03] Kitkattack: lmao
[4:19:08] Kitkattack: yay
[4:19:12] the_ol_regular: Ash, what about Conjuring 1?
