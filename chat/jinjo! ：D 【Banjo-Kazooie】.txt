[4:30:04] Navy_Mongoose: lore about that pirate, his game was cancelled in favor of Banjo Kazooie being made instead
[4:30:23] demon_dandy: Oh frr?
[4:30:49] chinwillach: Long as you're attacking you'll get 'em easy
[4:31:14] demon_dandy: I guess it makes sense the cove was one of the first levels
[4:31:24] Returner7: Banjo Kazooie weren't originally furries!
[4:31:25] chinwillach: Poor pirate never had a chance
[4:31:34] anonsama9001: do you have a schedgy planned for this week ashton51Squish
[4:31:59] demon_dandy: Animal mascots were in ashton51Tehe
[4:32:02] chinwillach: Banjo Kazooie went through quite several ideas before becoming the game it ended up being
[4:32:10] Senoquese: thatd be really fun but we should look at tutorials and stuff on discord beforehand LOOOL
[4:32:10] Navy_Mongoose: I think it was some game where you played as some pirate kid adventurer but they couldn't figure out how to make him appealing
[4:32:14] Kitkattack: oh man that's going to be tough
[4:32:34] Navy_Mongoose: so it was mutated over and over until it became Banjo Kazooie
[4:32:39] demon_dandy: @senoquese nahhhh she'll figure out the lakitu skip on her own :)

[4:32:58] Senoquese: we could link you some stuff before the stream to help you w it, i dont think its stuff you can figure out live ashton51Tehe
[4:32:59] chinwillach: Earliest iteration was an isometric RPG titled Dream: Land of Giants. Like Super Mario RPG
[4:33:04] a_shybot: imagine if banjo kazooie was made for adults? almightyKap
[4:33:12] Navy_Mongoose: I wonder if it's referenced in Sea of Thieves at all?

[4:35:21] chinwillach: Wii U was a decent console but it sold HORRIBLY
[4:35:24] T33bags: it’s ok to not know Scott the woz but it’s so inane that you asked if he was an Minecraft smp guy
[4:35:27] ChiaraStellata: Wii U had some good titles but its gimmicks like the controller with the screen never panned out
[4:35:28] Navy_Mongoose: the very first Scott The Woz moment is a Wii U being thrown out of his 2nd floor window
