[0:23:10] niertlwal: yeah i just made sure the original link was banned but that was just a stopgap
[0:23:18] niertlwal: i was taking a look real quick to see what else i can put on there
[0:23:25] allopettv: the setting bans all hyperlinks so nothing can get through now

[0:27:54] Adamisfruit: It’s a copyright nightmare
[0:27:59] niertlwal: was just cleaning up the old ones
[0:28:13] Dreamdecipher: a pasteleft dream
[0:28:34] JTBun: nintendo doesn't care
[0:28:38] JTBun: they never have
[0:28:44] JSD_VGZ: Trying to balance that many characters can't be easy
[0:28:48] cscolley: imagine putting your entire soul into a franchise and no matter what you do, people complain
[0:28:53] Senoquese: oooh i missed the shades! boyshton was too cool for shades...
[0:29:50] kid_cow: need to start tuning into your streams more your a joy to watch
[0:29:51] Senoquese: sakurai was a goat but most of nintendo sucks
[0:29:58] Senoquese: animal crossing was such a missed potential, they immediately gave up on it
[0:30:07] Senoquese: it only got like, a year of updates?
[0:31:15] MannedUpCentral: Hello! How's it going today?
[0:31:18] joshythewitch: different dev teams
[0:31:31] JSD_VGZ: You have a very interesting idea of game development
[0:31:39] rikkaonline: sometimes nintendo just has their own idea of the right way to have fun, and if you dont like then they dont care
[0:31:39] JTBun: nintendo just doesn't support their games much after launch
[0:31:41] JSD_VGZ: I do know the Animal Crossing Team is the Splatoon Team
[0:31:44] cscolley: Nintendo develops some but only publishes others. they don't make smash, HAL does.
[0:31:44] kid_cow: @Senoquese your so right!!!! my family used to be suuuper obsessed with the older games like new leaf but we all got new horizons and dropped it pretty quick
[0:31:49] joshythewitch: Like the Splatoon team really loves to keep working on their tgame
[0:31:50] beat_shobon: They have different dev teams, Smash Bros for example had outsourcing from Namco
[0:32:55] ReyJaggy: im back whats the hot take?
[0:32:56] 0oGooseo0: They really seem to hate metroid for some reason despite how much people want it.
[0:33:01] joshythewitch: If they had decided to make future AC updates paid, it wouldve been a lot of money they woulda got ngl
[0:33:09] 0oGooseo0: Also rip kid icarus
[0:33:10] cscolley: they can see the numbers we can't. they do the math on whether a franchise will make a return on investment before they allocate that money.
[0:33:30] joshythewitch: updates as in new seasonal cosmetics i mean
[0:33:31] ReyJaggy: Ah yeah, only zelda is their most cherished IP
[0:33:44] Senoquese: the animal crossing mobile game still gets updates but not the main game lol
[0:33:47] 0oGooseo0: Zelda and Mario
[0:34:04] cscolley: it's always money. that's how mafia works.
[0:34:21] ReyJaggy: doesnt stardew valley still get updates? animal crossing can still add stuff
[0:34:37] kid_cow: they could start porting over the furniture items from pocket camp to expand decoration options
[0:34:48] cscolley: !discord
[0:34:49] StreamElements: i don't have one mwahahaha jebaited............... or not?! https://discord.gg/hZGNxSB7gg
[0:34:57] joshythewitch: they couldve just kept adding new items haha
[0:35:32] joshythewitch: actually yknow what nintendo just fix your dumb way of doing online games first please
[0:35:32] kid_cow: i wish they didn't water down the villagers personalities so bad, none of them feel like my actual friends anymore
[0:36:00] CoreyChameleon: Well, I'm going to head out now. Bye!
[0:36:18] CoreyChameleon: No problem. Same to you!
[0:36:33] rikkaonline: game freak
[0:36:36] joshythewitch: Pokemon is game freak
[0:36:37] JSD_VGZ: mainline games are made by game freak
[0:36:41] rikkaonline: lol game freak is legit incompetent devs
[0:36:45] JSD_VGZ: Pokemon makes money no matter what, so they don't really have to try
[0:36:46] beat_shobon: if pokemon was managed directly by nintendo it would be so different ahahah
[0:37:20] phatscout: Do people really not like Animal Crossing now?
[0:37:22] Senoquese: being a nintendo fan is an abusive relationship
[0:38:03] zayhha: yeah, i can see that
[0:38:27] zayhha: heyo ashton, hope you're having a good day
[0:39:17] rikkaonline: i think modern games have exploded in development complexity, and people are expecting more in the same amount of time
[0:39:18] Senoquese: not having cheese anymore feels so freeing tbh
[0:39:26] JTBun: smash is more supported than much of their other games, but it still isn't at the level of other fighting games, like SF or GG It's not much of a financial thing , just think the teams at nintendo always need/want to work on different projects
[0:39:29] rikkaonline: like animal crossing was delayed a few times
[0:39:36] behoimii: where the bets ashton51Bongo
