[1:13:40] moush: some people got alexa or whateve around the house to take notes
[1:13:42] NilesNaomi: usually for me it's some youtube video I wanted to watch then I suddenly remember that I was looking at a specific reddit thread before I thought about it and retrace my steps.
[1:13:55] Senoquese: it could be slight adhd yeah

[1:14:16] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You should talk to your doc and see if you could test for it
[1:14:18] behoimii: next bet should be 5th or higher, ashton is getting too good at this
[1:14:23] Senoquese: adhd symptoms can come and go with age so might as well have it checked

[1:15:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: he had to have had something other than ADHD
[1:15:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cuz that makes no sense
[1:15:30] rikkaonline: japan first, then doctor
[1:15:31] behoimii: idk, there is only one way to know

[1:16:36] WhompingWalrus: We don't need to medicate personalities away lol.  If it isn't seriously harming your life just own it.
[1:16:40] Returner7: huh? ADHD is a classified as autism spectrum now isnt it?!
[1:16:48] jackrileyd: If you can live, and function without it. Don't get the medication. It's costly,  and you create a dependence.
[1:16:52] Returner7: YES
[1:17:03] barfchan: yeah its like a 3 way venn diagram with adhd/autism/ocd right
[1:17:13] TheRATifier1: I have both and I function without meds
[1:17:14] Senoquese: i have adhd and autism and yes it is hell
[1:17:20] demon_dandy: Im sure a doctor will have a better diagnosis than chat tbh ashton51Stare
[1:17:25] lesboyfriend: well they're related
[1:17:28] ReyJaggy: cant get diagnosed if i dont go to the doctor :pointhead:
[1:17:31] barfchan: im more adhd/ocd and it SUCKS
[1:17:46] rikkaonline: it sounds like your concerns about adhd may be the anxiety
[1:17:50] Returner7: ok... so you're on the spectrum, that sounds pretty normal LOL
[1:18:03] Soozaphone_: I’m back
[1:18:03] Senoquese: i got another error...
[1:18:04] vic_weave: OCD co-occurs with autism and ADD at a high rate

[1:18:19] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:18:25] 0oGooseo0: I feel like there's a lot of people who are on the spectrum tbh
[1:18:26] ReyJaggy: isnt mumei on the spectrum and found out until recently as an adult
[1:18:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: To be fair japan has shit societal views on mental health so like. dont follow japanese societal tropes
[1:18:28] moush: ofc the time i believe
[1:18:43] MikeFiro: Autism is in fact quite literally a BEEG Spectrum and does in fact overlap with ADHD/OCD etc :(
[1:18:57] Senoquese: it was all the boogers you ate as a kid that made you like this
[1:19:07] TheRATifier1: Wait Mumei is autistic?
[1:19:10] demon_dandy: Maybe it  was the pumice stone...
[1:19:15] rikkaonline: yeah
[1:19:17] Senoquese: yeah
[1:19:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @TheRATifier yeah
[1:19:24] Senoquese: you just have a faulty brain, thats it
[1:19:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: autism presents in wildly different ways
[1:19:31] rikkaonline: sounds reasonable
[1:19:35] 0oGooseo0: Yeah, makes sense
[1:19:44] Senoquese: NO I MEAN, in the end with all the terms, its just that everyones brains are faulty in someway
[1:20:00] rikkaonline: damn not just adhd, but adhd 2
[1:20:10] TheRATifier1: @mrp0p1nfr3sh Y'know that makes so much sense now XD
[1:20:21] horribleham: We diagnose this race queen with 'all'
[1:20:36] demon_dandy: Went to doc marten and she diagnosed me with cringe ashton51Wibble

[1:20:51] Senoquese: shes got the ashtism and the ASDHD
[1:20:53] ReyJaggy: You are diagnosed with delulu yabai yaoi syndrome
[1:20:54] vic_weave: OCD is a rather severe disorder though, and I think a lot of people understate it's compulsions
[1:21:19] Senoquese: ashton can you tell nintendo to fix their servers

[1:21:48] Returner7: alright top 5 bet once again!!!
[1:21:59] HashiriyaR32: I think Blur from Bizarre Creations  kinda fits the bill, but it came out in 2010, and was even a bit more on the arcade side
[1:22:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I too have generalized anxiety depression and ocd tendencies but i havent been diagnosed on that
[1:22:03] Senoquese: if you are on twitch you are more prone to getting mental illness
[1:22:14] MikeFiro: and the problem with Autism etc. is the big misconception that others who dont have/ know about it and how that affects a community :x
[1:22:17] 0oGooseo0: I've heard that part of ocd is having intrusive thoughts
[1:22:19] behoimii: take the meds only for doctor marten streams and be normal ashotn for the other streams tamapoSip

[1:23:21] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:23:42] Senoquese: oh my anime
[1:24:03] vic_weave: Kick is just Twitch but allows more types of streams
[1:24:14] rikkaonline: kick has no moderation and exists to promote the gambling company that owns it
[1:24:16] Returner7: @vic_weave so Justin.tv LMAO!
[1:24:17] vic_weave: allows multistreams too
[1:24:26] moush: some of them are banned twitch/yt people yea
[1:24:28] horribleham: It's a little sussy
[1:24:36] horribleham: LOL
[1:24:49] barfchan: them copying the twitch UI nearly 1:1 is so funny to me
[1:24:50] demon_dandy: Its a bit weirdge but on the surface its just a twitch competitor
[1:24:52] vic_weave: they are less concerned about being "family friendly"
[1:24:58] Senoquese: i know a twitch that allows more streams, its called chaturbate

[1:25:52] kizakyun: I HAVE TO RUN NOW but thanks for the RACES
[1:25:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Kick is bad because they stole old twitch software to build the platform then pay people to gamble to entice kids.
[1:25:57] MikeFiro: ill be back
[1:25:58] moush: they're literally paying twitch for it
[1:26:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ALSO they dont content moderate so theres straight porn and neo nazis
[1:26:06] JTBun: Kick as a platform might be fine, but it allows for anyone to pretty much do anything and not be punished much for it... which will lead to insanely horrible communities and streamers
[1:26:08] rikkaonline: having the competition is good, otherwise twitch will just keep squeezing more money out of streamers
[1:26:17] ReyJaggy: thanks believers
[1:26:19] JTBun: and it's backed by a huge online gambling company
[1:26:21] lesboyfriend: İ'll always believe..

[1:27:29] rikkaonline: itll be a short trial, that kind of thing is pretty settled law lol
[1:27:30] vic_weave: ostensibly, XQC could be the one liable
[1:28:13] rikkaonline: yeah kick is just a provider in that case
[1:28:21] demon_dandy: Well thhe difference imo is ninja didnt really have a community, had viewers
[1:28:24] TheAsterite: the ip holder would sue both tbh
[1:28:39] TheAsterite: xqc for streaming it, and kick for doing nothing about it
[1:28:45] vic_weave: he is the one violating the media sharing; companies go after platforms in order to save themselves money pursuing individuals
[1:28:49] moush: ashton51Heh
[1:28:59] rikkaonline: if the streaming site gets a notice of violation, they have to cut access to maintain their protection
[1:29:09] jackrileyd: Remember the "Lowe moderation" complaint also means less BS punishment for streamers. Viewers on Twitch can cause a streamer to get suspended.
[1:29:20] Senoquese: most mental illness is internal than something that just shows
[1:29:34] rikkaonline: i think ocd is something that people without it dont usually understand
[1:29:54] vic_weave: Depending on the compulsions OCD can be more or less observable
[1:29:59] Returner7: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[1:30:04] Senoquese: yeah i feel like my adhd is impossible to explain to others lmao

[1:30:11] Matharu_: wheel op
[1:30:12] Returner7: alright, I'll make the next bet a top 7 bet LOL!
[1:30:23] vic_weave: but when you have, "I have to lock the door three times or else I don't know if reality exists" it can be a severe issue
[1:30:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: in reguards to XQC he and kick will be held liable because they dont hold him accountable so they can claim negligence on KICKS part
[1:30:27] metaconstruct: ashton51Smile despite everything its still u
[1:30:35] Senoquese: how do i tell ppl that it feels like i have 2 brains that disagree w each other without being locked up

[1:31:00] JTBun: I mean, I do that too
[1:31:08] JTBun: I just to make sure i did lock it
[1:31:10] rikkaonline: @mrp0p1nfr3sh if kick gets a dmca notice and doesnt act, then they will be responsible
[1:31:11] Returner7: huh ok this will be a top 5 only 9 ppl
[1:31:23] ReyJaggy: damn
[1:31:24] demon_dandy: Yeah i get randomly paranoid every now and then
[1:31:32] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @rikkaonline even without it they can still be held liable because DMCA is supposed to hold him accountable
[1:31:43] TheAsterite: my adhd has me fixating on collecting things
[1:32:02] horribleham: lolol
[1:32:07] jackrileyd: Ashton, just open the door with a gun in hand.  No need to be afraid.
