[2:13:14] HDoomGuy: emphasis on slightly

[2:13:38] JTBun: I mean all N64 games usually had ass cameras lmaooo
[2:13:41] demon_dandy: I feel like the movement betrays the camera more than mario 64 ashton51Tehe
[2:13:45] Burr11: haha he totally was like "you're gonna die because you suck"
[2:13:54] Navy_Mongoose: M64 didn't let you recenter the camera though, it always locked you in certain angles
[2:13:57] T33bags: that was your spy training
[2:14:01] Kitkattack: and that's when the darkness in Ash started ashton51Angy
[2:14:12] HDoomGuy: i think the camera controls are a little more intuitive but some of the default camera movements suck pretty hard yeah
[2:14:20] HDoomGuy: such is the n64 life
[2:14:44] BibingkaBear: guh-huh~
[2:14:53] TheAsterite: probably c-up

[3:09:54] metaconstruct: tailbone check ashton51Sadcheer
[3:09:58] raiifrost: A worthy risk
[3:10:17] raiifrost: She can't be a race queen if she didn't take such risks
[3:10:43] HDoomGuy: i feel like i have too much of an anxious disposition to eat raw food lmfao
[3:11:07] raiifrost: All the salmon goes to the ass
[3:11:08] HDoomGuy: oh nice
[3:11:29] rikkaonline: if bears can eat it safely, then so can you
[3:11:33] fixedspectacles2014: I might've eaten a burger that was a little raw. We will see if I get sick tomorrow
[3:11:46] fixedspectacles2014: ashton51Stare
[3:12:14] HDoomGuy: nice nice!
[3:12:29] rikkaonline: ground beef and steak is way different
[3:12:30] fixedspectacles2014: It was def raw
[3:12:35] fixedspectacles2014: I was so hungry though
[3:12:45] rikkaonline: steak can be raw, ground beef CANNOT
[3:12:46] Navy_Mongoose: undercooked ground beef is a different game
[3:12:47] raiifrost: I've had my fair share of pink chicken, my stomach is basically iron
[3:12:52] RycegoZ: Rare meat is icky. Everyone knows medium is the best
[3:12:54] HDoomGuy: and yeah rare/medium-rare burgers are good too so i guess i do have some raw experience, all the horror stories are just afiliated with fish for whatever reason
[3:12:55] InsaneLoke: rare burgers give me heartburn but rare steaks are awesome
[3:13:12] InsaneLoke: raw chicken is like the most dangerous lmao
[3:13:13] HDoomGuy: oh yeah pink chicken is bad news
[3:13:16] BibingkaBear: ooh yeah ceviche so good
[3:13:21] Navy_Mongoose: pink chicken is nono
[3:13:25] demon_dandy: we made nyquil chicien for you ashton ashton51Squish
[3:13:26] fixedspectacles2014: My stomach is quite strong so I should be okay
[3:13:34] RycegoZ: Ceviche with tostadas on the beach is great
[3:13:35] T33bags: ceviche is technically not raw because you cook it chemically with lime
[3:13:40] raiifrost: Raw chicken is VERY bad, but I've already bit into it, so, can't waste it
[3:13:51] raiifrost: At least it was cooked somewhat
[3:13:59] InsaneLoke: once i bought uncooked breaded chicken before thinking it was precooked and bit right into it while rushing out the door
[3:14:01] pomatomaster: AYO PINE MARTEN REPRESENTATION
[3:14:06] rikkaonline: in japan their supply chain is clean enough raw chicken is possible, but i cant imagine the texture would be any good
[3:14:07] pomatomaster: ratJAM
[3:14:12] demon_dandy: Even if pink chicken wasnt evil salomnella, the texture would be way too gross
[3:14:14] RycegoZ: Why Pine Marten and not Pine Tree?
[3:14:26] pomatomaster: no shot - meat all the way
[3:14:41] T33bags: ceviche is raw shrimp in prep but lime cooks it chemically just like when you make carne apache with raw beef
[3:14:42] pomatomaster: how do you?
[3:14:44] InsaneLoke: love meat 💓
[3:14:52] InsaneLoke: its a reflection
[3:15:03] pomatomaster: how are you? (is what i mean lol)
[3:15:11] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[3:15:21] Navy_Mongoose: first person
[3:15:31] raiifrost: Yeah, lime denatures the protein in a way that simulates being "cooked"
[3:15:36] InsaneLoke: bleh :ppppp
[3:15:46] pomatomaster: eating hot tamales so we vibing
[3:16:01] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:16:02] raiifrost: Well, not lime, but the acid
[3:16:06] InsaneLoke: ???
[3:16:06] Navy_Mongoose: what's wrong with hot tamales?
[3:16:08] pomatomaster: YOU DONT LIKE HOT TAMALES????
[3:16:12] InsaneLoke: whats wrong with tamales????
[3:16:17] fixedspectacles2014: hot tamales are just kinda gross
[3:16:23] T33bags: @pomatomaster do you mean the gum or real tamales

[3:44:49] demon_dandy: Hes one wicked cricket, thats all we know
[3:45:15] Navy_Mongoose: I had Frogger, I hated it
[3:45:21] demon_dandy: She was kinda cracked at zapper ngl
[3:45:25] Navy_Mongoose: 1997
[3:45:36] HDoomGuy: i loved Frogger on PS1 as a kid and i loved it and then played it as an adult and its so evil
[3:45:46] Navy_Mongoose: I liked 3d Frog Frenzy
[3:45:53] HDoomGuy: yeah
[3:45:59] HDoomGuy: yeah that's the one
[3:46:16] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul

[3:47:05] demon_dandy: Shovelware streams are always fun
[3:47:15] HDoomGuy: a lot of things are extremely fucking dumb so that's a bit hard to quantify

[3:47:44] HDoomGuy: i guess it's a Vibe Thing
[3:47:49] the_monster_mike: so 3d frogger?
[3:47:54] HDoomGuy: oh yeah true
[3:47:57] InsaneLoke: ash would you ever be interested in streaming the borderlands series
[3:48:09] HDoomGuy: i feel like Zapper is less shovelware and more of a Mascot Platformer Game
[3:48:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Those are great games
[3:48:22] HDoomGuy: i hate Borderlands with a passion
[3:48:22] InsaneLoke: its pretty fun
[3:48:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I skipped 1 but 2 and 3 are great
[3:48:30] RycegoZ: Borderlands is kinda meh tbh
[3:48:38] raiifrost: I'd watch as long as it was an Ashton Marten stream
[3:48:44] demon_dandy: borderlands are kinda fun but unless youre dedicated they get a bit mind numbin
[3:48:51] T33bags: i think it could be fun and the first playthrough of borderlands 2 is easy and fun
[3:48:51] Navy_Mongoose: I liked Borderlands 2 for a while until I got sick of pumping lead into meatshields for an hour
[3:48:52] HDoomGuy: yeah a lot of Mascot Platformer things are cynical
[3:49:04] HDoomGuy: or not completely cynical but definitely have that 'capitalizing on a thing' quality
[3:49:06] T33bags: borderlands 2 was really well recieved more than 1 i think
[3:49:24] ganondorfongolf: Borderlands 1 and 2 were fun, but the writing gets worse with each game.
[3:49:25] demon_dandy: ashton51Sip
[3:49:36] HDoomGuy: yeah honestly i played the borderlands games back in the day and they don't hold up in the gameplay or writing department
[3:49:45] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[3:49:46] InsaneLoke: id say 2 is the only one worth playing
[3:49:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the cucked guy did the writing
[3:49:49] HDoomGuy: no it was written BY the guy who got cucked
[3:49:52] HDoomGuy: Anthony Burch
