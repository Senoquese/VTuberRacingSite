[1:48:48] rikkaonline: basically the logic to eps 1 and 2 was they were going to make shorter chapters so the whole game wouldnt get held up
[1:49:08] Leo_Taku_: @JTBun Of course, its just in their position, hardware has loads more of returns even if the stuff fails lol
[1:49:12] Senoquese: the hl3 discussion is kinda long and complicated, might be something for a post-hl2 discussion stream lol

[2:26:02] Navy_Mongoose: the enemies are combine, the rebels are the human companions
[2:26:07] the_ol_regular: @mcdoomington2 sure but IРђЎll see when

[2:27:42] ApocalypseSC: tech leaps between games in the 90s/2000s were so drastic
[2:27:46] ApocalypseSC: crazy going from hl to hl2
[2:27:58] the_ol_regular: I, love, video games
[2:28:02] rikobutepic: whats with all the ketchup
[2:28:02] ApocalypseSC: ive been playing quake 1 and it must have been insane going from doom to that
[2:28:06] the_ol_regular: Controversial take I know
[2:28:08] demon_dandy: Lmao
[2:28:11] Burr11: aw
[2:28:15] rikobutepic: angeli405Aim
[2:28:39] Burr11: @ApocalypseSC it was! it was like OMG it's actually 3D now
[2:28:42] rikobutepic: its because the same people are still in charge
[2:28:52] Burr11: and the multiplayer was next level
[2:28:53] Kitkattack: idk about all that
[2:29:02] Kitkattack: Moore's law still holding strong
[2:29:08] Burr11: alyx!! ashton51Baby
[2:29:22] Burr11: moore's law is that cpu speed keeps doubling
[2:29:25] Burr11: or something
[2:29:30] rikkaonline: transistor density doubles every 24 months iirc
[2:29:33] the_ol_regular: Brb
[2:29:34] ApocalypseSC: and just in quake's level design they slowly introduce what the tech is capable of. by the end of the game the levels are so much more advanced
[2:29:36] Navy_Mongoose: Personally I like to look at how cellphones evolved
[2:29:51] the_ol_regular: @navy_mongoose same
[2:29:53] Kitkattack: ^essentially that processors become expontially more powerful
[2:29:53] barfchan: SNIFFA
[2:30:09] rikkaonline: more cpu power in the same space
[2:30:12] JTBun: lmao ummm, computers get faster every 2 years
[2:30:14] Kitkattack: cpus/computer hardware
[2:30:15] JTBun: basically
[2:30:30] Navy_Mongoose: they used to be massive and expensive luxuries, now they're much smaller and affordable necessities
[2:30:47] JTBun: we are expanding to AI
[2:30:49] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:30:56] rikkaonline: if you compare the size of websites or games, we are definitely using that extra power
[2:31:01] Senoquese: its a bit crazy to say imo, it might normalize vr for normie audiences but it doesnt do much besides passthrough and AI shit
[2:31:03] Kitkattack: Ashton, all kids have chromebooks now in school
[2:31:06] rikkaonline: its just more mundane than youd expect
[2:31:07] Kitkattack: a lot has changed
[2:31:10] Burr11: the thing is like 5-10 year old CPUs are still pretty damn usable for most things except the most demanding games.. in the past you were FUCKED if you had a computer that old
[2:31:10] JTBun: it's insanely useful in medical fields and stuff
[2:31:11] the_ol_regular: Who?
[2:31:23] rikkaonline: your phone is more powerful than those lab pcs
[2:31:43] the_ol_regular: Chat has a lot of tech experts
[2:31:47] demon_dandy: tbh all kids having iphones was where i was at
[2:31:53] ApocalypseSC: I'm still playing everything on a 4790k, from 2015
[2:32:01] the_ol_regular: I just want my PC to run games at a reasonable performance while looking sexy
[2:32:05] Kitkattack: you're not wrong, computer literacy has actually gone down because society is more and more mobile centric
[2:32:26] Senoquese: LOL
[2:32:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:32:32] anonsama9001: lel
[2:32:35] Burr11: yeah kids think computers are magic now.. in the past you had to deal with the actual computer to get stuff done
[2:33:02] Senoquese: funky music time
[2:33:04] barfchan: hey HEY city 17 is one of the FINEST remaining urban centers
[2:33:13] JTBun: For most people AI is not super useful, but the Medical field and other fields of work can use AI to significantly help. (Not including AI art and stuff, shit sucks)

[2:36:00] demon_dandy: asked her 15 x 16 and smoke started coming out her ears ashton51Wibble
[2:36:26] McDoomington2: @JTBun AI art always came off as using it for the wrong thing. It always felt to me like something that would be more useful for boring, repetitive tasks that are pretty much always the same, not the stuff that's simpler for human artists but which AI doesn't understand and which inevitably has to be fixed by a human artist.
[2:36:26] anonsama9001: lol demon
[2:36:32] demon_dandy: they dont wanna get shot ashton51Wah

[3:06:23] Senoquese: and the collabs that youve done, were mostly with the same people
[3:06:30] Senoquese: so they could assume you only do collabs with friends

[3:13:36] Kitkattack: poor birb ashton51Kneel killed by buggy collision
[3:13:46] McDoomington2: Probably bugs left over that were never fixed as HL2 was updated over the years.
[3:14:04] Navy_Mongoose: that bird was then when I first played this 12 years ago
[3:14:08] Navy_Mongoose: there*

[3:14:47] Senoquese: for 2 decades, npcs wouldnt even blink until an update some months ago
[3:15:21] McDoomington2: There's a mod called the Half-Life 2 update on steam that puts it on the EP2 engine and makes minuscule technical improvements.
[3:15:25] Navy_Mongoose: barney calls them that
[3:15:26] demon_dandy: yeah this era and early xbox 360 era is filled with amazin games that are overlooked for older or closer gen games
[3:15:28] Senoquese: but the episodes are more recent and have tons of more fixes and features
[3:15:35] skweeki: the headcrabs are kinda cute imo ashton51Squish

[3:24:12] demon_dandy: LMAOOO
[3:24:17] Senoquese: these later parts of the game were so old that they were partially made in the hl1 engine and just tweaked
[3:24:23] Senoquese: they ran out of time by this part and just wanted to release the game
[3:24:41] Kitkattack: The Regal City North theater on Western has a deal with Crunchyroll and they show a bunch of anime movies
[3:25:07] demon_dandy: yeah i dont even remember this ashton51Tehe i remember the final section bein so cool that i just skipped this ig

[3:26:47] Xuang101: Can we hear an Ashton dying noise?
[3:27:10] Senoquese: a part of the map in the last chapter was so old it was before they used models regularly, so they were still making stuff out of cubes, and they never bothered updating it since
[3:27:30] Xuang101: How do you die so quickly?
[3:27:41] Blazemage2001: helloooo
[3:27:45] McDoomington2: @Senoquese Yeah, some parts of Half-Life 1 are directly inspired by Akira. The freight elevator where headcrabs come down on you has even been confirmed to be an Akira reference by one of the devs.
[3:27:51] Bookethead: talent

[3:30:36] McDoomington2: They're both very smart and very stupid. On one hand they tend to bunch up around you no matter what, on the other they can navigate rough terrain and do things like bunkering tactics.
[3:30:42] demon_dandy: imagine being that solo combine and seein 6 people
[3:30:46] Xuang101: If we compare bowling I would say... Gutter ball

[3:34:51] Blazemage2001: bowling screens when you get a strike:
[3:35:05] Senoquese: LOOOOOL
[3:35:09] McDoomington2: Fun fact: Gordon's face model is the result of Valve devs David Speyrer, Eric Kirchmer, Greg Coomer, and Kelley Bailey's faces being morphed together.
[3:35:18] Senoquese: the citizens get so sad when you die but barney doesnt care
[3:35:44] Senoquese: if you dont immediately reload the save, theyll start mourning you
[3:35:49] Xuang101: Wanna try avoiding bullets?
[3:36:04] demon_dandy: When you stand and roll it like goes to the right of your hand but when crouch and bowl it goes right from the center ashton51Tehe
[3:36:10] McDoomington2: And yes, Valve had a dev with the last name Coomer.
[3:37:06] demon_dandy: we held them off ashton ashton51Angy
[3:37:41] godlessweeb: "Gordon you useless fuck" seemed a little much but valve knows what they're doing I guess
[3:37:50] McDoomington2: Yeah, they only do that if Gordon is actually dead.
[3:37:56] Senoquese: yeah when you die and they mourn theyll be like "can you hear me doctor?? dont go into the light!" or theyll start crying and saying its hopeless ashton51Tehe
[3:38:12] demon_dandy: i swear this is a pc only section my ass did not roll no grenads ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[3:38:23] McDoomington2: Probably because Valve thought it might get annoying if you end up at low health a lot.
[3:38:58] demon_dandy: @senoquese fake flatlining on the hospital bed to see if anyone cries
[3:39:05] Senoquese: @demon_dandy LOOOOOOOOOL

[3:39:45] Navy_Mongoose: @McDoomington2 yes, but if they didn't want to be annoying then why do NPCs remind you to reload every time you arne't 100%?
[3:39:46] Xuang101: What goodie would Ashton like?
[3:39:50] Xuang101: A cookie?
[3:39:57] Blazemage2001: a dr pepper

[4:00:11] Kitkattack: well she does love your stream and mentions you ninoegHEART
[4:00:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BUT it is good etiquette to not bring others up on streams that they aren't there during collabs

[4:01:26] Senoquese: rockets
[4:01:29] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Rockets yeah
[4:01:29] Kitkattack: I think that's a stupid rule, it should be obvious that all streamers also enjoy watch some other people/vtuber's streams too
[4:01:35] McDoomington2: Rockets
[4:01:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Kitkattack its more to keep focus on the streamer
[4:01:47] Senoquese: the rule is there for a reason
[4:01:48] Datadraino: nah, it feels good to get invited to stuff
[4:01:52] McDoomington2: Striders are only damaged by explosives.
[4:02:00] Blazemage2001: it avoids awkwardness
[4:02:01] rikkaonline: the rule is for us, not you
[4:02:09] demon_dandy: i think nino loooove you ashton51Heh

[4:03:39] rikkaonline: until they write the twitlonger youre good to talk about them all you want imo
[4:04:15] Senoquese: they give you more
[4:04:33] Kitkattack: I get that it's a bit rude for us to bring up other tubers but no one exists in a vacuum
[4:04:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Just gotta run
[4:04:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: dont sit in one spot
[4:04:45] Kitkattack: I'm totally fine when you talk about other ones <3
[4:04:59] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, it's a very fine line
[4:05:10] demon_dandy: I think its valid to ponder but also an ashton overthink moment maybe ashton51Love
[4:05:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its a common rule in vtubing because it can cause people to focus on other vtubers instead of the vtuber you are watching. thats why its just common to only talk about the vtuber you are interacting with.
[4:06:21] T33bags: jealous gfe but shes just actually jealous ashton51Angy
[4:06:36] Blazemage2001: very fair
[4:06:39] Senoquese: she ACTUALLY hates it when we play fortnite ashton51Wibble
[4:06:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its our daily toxo plasmosis injection guys
[4:07:04] Navy_Mongoose: can we still talk about Jerma though?
[4:07:12] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yes because jerma is ashi
[4:07:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: jerma is ashis pastlife
[4:07:24] T33bags: @Navy_Mongoose she is jerma so its the same thing
[4:07:26] Senoquese: i see it as a rule that exists in the case that people screw up and overstep - they were already warned, but context matters a lot especially if ashton brings it up first
[4:08:22] demon_dandy: i was gonna say "look ashton its nino ashton51Baby " when the strider appeared tbf ashton51Love
[4:09:10] demon_dandy: Yeye i feel that, its a lil too reference for reference sake
[4:09:19] Kitkattack: it's one thing if it's relevant to the conversation
[4:09:21] DatBoiVLC: 2 apples tall ashton51Squish
[4:09:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: just follow the rules guys.
[4:09:24] Navy_Mongoose: 2ft? Isn't she an insect?
[4:09:27] BurkeTheBerserkLurker: gtg, goodnight and God Bless
[4:09:38] Senoquese: this part used to be easier but the games age and bugs made the citizens worse at shooting the striders
[4:09:50] T33bags: hmmm i guess the vtubers i associate you with most are vtubers youve probably inroduced to soremama
[4:09:55] demon_dandy: LMAO
[4:09:57] Datadraino: nah its just those 1am thoughts that cloud ya mind
[4:10:08] Senoquese: yeahhh i getcha

[4:10:18] Senoquese: its *your* time and we are here for *you*
[4:10:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Just run i think?
[4:10:28] demon_dandy: Different streamers have different comfort levels with that
[4:10:32] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i kept running and shooting
[4:11:04] Senoquese: LOL
[4:11:10] Kitkattack: oh god I'm jk
[4:11:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i think so?
[4:11:23] godlessweeb: Tumblr callout post "Well known menace Ashton Marten calls out existence of other vtubers, quoted as saying "when I'm offline your job is to make fancams of me and nothing else""
[4:11:27] Navy_Mongoose: I go to my best friend's stream and spam your emotes ashton51Heh
[4:11:32] T33bags: i think the way you phrase it comes off more parasocial than it is you just dont want the topic to change from you and your stream to others
[4:11:32] Kitkattack: I'm a little bit more self aware of my online presence FailFish
[4:11:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @godlessweeb ISNT THAT WHAT ANDREW TATE DOES LMAO
[4:11:45] Kitkattack: at least I'd like to think so
[4:11:55] DatBoiVLC: Me hopping in my friends VC while *they're* streaming "You'll never guess what Ashton did today!!!"
[4:12:14] Navy_Mongoose: idk, do you get pissed off if anyone uses others emotes here?
[4:12:20] godlessweeb: I use this one all the time ashton51Baby but I just assume they think its a random anime girl
[4:12:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I got banned from another vtubers chat for dropping your chilla emotes... cuz i was subscribed to you. but like they didnt have emotes...
[4:12:24] Navy_Mongoose: plus theres BTTV stuff
[4:12:24] Senoquese: its like, theres so many other places where we could bring that kinda conversation about others up, doing it specifically on ashtons chat during *her* specific streaming time for herself is kinda weird
[4:12:26] DatBoiVLC: Anyone who gets pissed off about another streamers emotes being used in their chat is petty ashton51Stare
[4:12:28] demon_dandy: LMAO hmmmm wonder whod use ashton emotes everywhere ashton51Stare
[4:12:31] Kitkattack: @DatBoiVLC I do that with a lot of my friends that are deep into vtubers ashton51Omega
[4:12:31] JTBun: I mean, I personally don't see the issue with emotes
[4:12:39] rikkaonline: yuzuOMEGALUL
[4:12:57] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe

[4:13:00] justatree2: ashton51Love so cute
[4:13:11] T33bags: @T33bags like i guess that can come off as jealous but its more like common courtesy
[4:13:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: louett1Eyes
[4:13:16] demon_dandy: This is becoming more and more clear its ashton anxiety ashton51Tehe
[4:13:17] DatBoiVLC: Prey Animal Behaviour
[4:13:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Squish
[4:13:52] Kitkattack: are you kidding me that's hype, it's like "oooo amaiumChuuu amai enjoyer"
[4:13:53] Senoquese: shes partially right and its also partially anxiety, in the end i do get what she means and where those feelings are coming from
[4:14:06] godlessweeb: When I see a mutual sub of a vtuber when I'm in a non-vtuber stream I do think "aah, a fellow traveler
[4:14:35] demon_dandy: Yeye, i moreso mean the fear that other people get annoyed at her emotes
[4:14:36] Senoquese: LMAO ashton51Tehe
[4:14:47] Navy_Mongoose: I know you say to use your emotes disrespectfully, but I honestly try not, usually just reaching for whatever emote I feel is best suited for the message
