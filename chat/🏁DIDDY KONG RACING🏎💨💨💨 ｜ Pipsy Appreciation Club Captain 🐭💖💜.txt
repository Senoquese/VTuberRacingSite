[2:32:53] LouetteTheClown_: i'm so sorry i broke concentration OOF
[2:32:54] Playmer: I mostly just think pipsy just makes it way harder
[2:32:55] demon_dandy: you overtook him for a bit too ashton51Pog
[2:33:08] KittyCuddler_443: E
[2:33:22] Playmer: She has a very low top speed, so it makes gaining a lot harder
[2:33:57] demon_dandy: sometimes its like the missles have a phat hurtbox, other times its like a needle
[2:34:11] AlexRod01234: dw the hover is my least favorite
[2:34:28] bhodg22: is thus game truely better than mario kart 64?
[2:34:44] ReyJaggy: ashton51Bork
[2:34:47] Playmer: I'm not realling saying you should switch, but you _are_ on hard mode. So you're the best player of this tbh
[2:34:48] demon_dandy: its different flavors tbh
[2:34:50] AlexRod01234: ashton51Bork
[2:34:56] MuttleyStrikeout: do you know that letting go of acceleration when you use a boost gives you a bigger one?
[2:35:11] MuttleyStrikeout: oh maybe
[2:35:14] demon_dandy: the zipper boost tech ashton51Pog
[2:35:35] AlexRod01234: still I'd prefer Pipsy any day
[2:35:44] Playmer: Banjo is all top speed, bad accelleration
[2:36:06] demon_dandy: the music changin on character select is rad
[2:36:09] AlexRod01234: I heard Tiptup
[2:36:27] MuttleyStrikeout: isnt bumper op?
[2:36:59] Peplen: this song is a banger
[2:37:11] demon_dandy: when you hover on different characters it changes too

[2:38:52] AlexRod01234: ashton51Love
[2:38:57] Playmer: The real issue is that pipsy is a 1/5 top speed
[2:39:13] Playmer: https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Diddy_Kong_Racing/Characters
