[3:09:49] demon_dandy: anyone else getting the glowing objective icon on the "release airlock" lever? ashton51Smile ashton51Smile
[3:10:19] Burr11: i guess it just glows whatever you're aimed at

[3:13:37] a_shybot: sorry, ive been lurking and junk, but in all honesty this game is perfectly scary without being in vr. it just takes a bit for the actual game to start
[3:13:40] Returner7: yeah the cold sleep hibernation during long distance travel leads to these kinds of time shenanigans
[3:13:40] Kitkattack: WHERE ARE MY OBJECTIVES LADY
[3:13:46] dax812: Ashton literally got hired on this ship and no one told her what to do
[3:13:54] Senoquese: is the game stretched vertically? or am i insane
[3:13:59] InsaneLoke: REEH
[3:13:59] dax812: aur aur aur aur aur
[3:14:06] Burr11: the lip syncing feels off

[3:14:46] Senoquese: loosen the strap maybe
[3:14:49] luwudco: yeah I cant look at screen, vr is pain
[3:15:28] Senoquese: you should try to get a more modern headset, better resolution and fps helps with nausea ashton51Tehe
[3:16:11] Senoquese: oh it is that, but theres stuff that can help with that
[3:16:11] luwudco: What headset are you using?
[3:16:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its not her headset
[3:16:12] Burr11: yeah its the movement not matching what you're seeing that's most of the issue..
[3:16:15] InsaneLoke: the better fps helps nausea immensely
[3:16:24] Returner7: i suppose this first portion is the job simulator portion?
[3:16:31] Kitkattack: Scooting around on a desk chair will just do that to you
[3:16:38] Senoquese: try to loosen the strap too if your head hurts
[3:16:43] moush: uh prob like an hour in lul
[3:16:58] Kitkattack: If you aren't used to it people usually teleport around like vrchat
[3:17:02] Burr11: yeah whats the point if its not gonna be scary
[3:17:06] Senoquese: LMAO it took like an hour in the movie too
[3:17:11] Returner7: lol yeah it's making me motion sick too
[3:17:13] JTBun: yeah VR might just make this too confusing
[3:17:26] Burr11: i would get out of VR.. clear this boring part, and then get back in for the scary part
[3:17:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The game was not made for VR it makes it way worse
[3:17:27] moush: i remember getting lost here even w/o vr
[3:17:46] ReyJaggy: lol
[3:17:50] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh it works perfectly in vr if you already know how the game works, as good as a mod can

[3:19:32] AshtonMarten: kitkattack has won 10 from the slots!
[3:19:33] JTBun: yeah if you are getting sick from this, then yeah I would switch
[3:19:46] dax812: Feels like desktop would be more immersive but this is also cool to watch
[3:20:17] Senoquese: the game is always just like this in vr or desktop, its mostly just a matter of you feeling sick
[3:20:19] dax812: its so funny that the cutscenes get all small
[3:20:25] barfchan: ichimaiaScared
[3:20:30] Kitkattack: No way

[3:21:14] T33bags: ???
[3:21:19] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh thats not what im saying lol, im saying most of her problems w the game are w the game itself
[3:21:52] Kitkattack: This is ng for vr
[3:22:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese I played the game unmodded and never had issues with gameplay so idk feels like the mod isnt adding more than its making the game harder but its up to her if she is feeling sick from it.
[3:22:47] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh idk why youre arguing with this lol, if shes lost shes gonna be lost in vr or desktop ashton51Tehe
