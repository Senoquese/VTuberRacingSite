[0:39:43] Angelofdeath640: I feel like wing was more Yaoi bait
[0:39:44] Red__2: we were all young once and clicked whatever looked cool on the "legitimate website" of choice

[0:49:19] RokuwaNeoro: Oh the other FLCL seasons don't exist
[0:49:22] TheDocperian: For sure
[0:49:22] DavidPortnov: It could be.
[0:49:26] The_Great_Moof: it's very "young boy" roded
[0:49:29] demon_dandy: Oooo im just ogre ashton51Despair
[0:49:31] TurtleSheen: that's true, it's more boy-focused
[0:49:34] The_Great_Moof: coded*
[0:49:43] Lord_Scrublet: flcl really is about MALE puberty to make a correction of myself
[0:49:44] Kitkattack: it is a young boy's anime coded for sure
[0:49:45] MelvinSoupreme: i like how twitchy your eyebrows are with the glasses
[0:49:48] InsaneLoke: themeslop carried by visuals
[0:49:53] Potatoidea: It is cool that Frieren is basically a modern classic
[0:49:56] deafmutelaughing: yeah.... I need a few more years to say frieren is in the greats
[0:50:16] Senoquese: LOLLLL
[0:50:20] Yergos: I like the frieren manga a lot, I haven't seen the anime though
[0:50:29] Haloghostj: LUCKY STAR THE GOAT I'VE SEEN IT 20+ TIMES
[0:50:39] DavidPortnov: @Yergos Same. I'm up through most of Season 1 in the manga.
[0:50:43] TheDocperian: I found I enjoyed the Nichijou manga way funnier than the anime
[0:50:44] Kitkattack: 4koma are the worst with having a lot of impossible to translate jokes
[0:50:46] InsaneLoke: cultural tom and jerry connection
[0:50:48] demon_dandy: Its also extremely pretty
[0:50:58] JTBun: i love nichijo
[0:51:01] The_Great_Moof: Nichijou is good but the best part of it has gotta be "Helvetica Standard"
[0:51:06] DavidPortnov: Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei must have been wild to localize.
[0:51:09] Haloghostj: Everytime I've rewatched I catch more stuff
[0:51:15] Potatoidea: D:
[0:51:16] The_Great_Moof: OWWWW
[0:51:21] Senoquese: hmm helvetica standard rings a bell Clueless
[0:51:23] horribleham: To be fair. You need a lot of cultural intelligence about the US to understand South Park yaoi
[0:51:27] theSimplechild: Helvetica Standard is hit or miss but the hits hit hard
[0:51:28] demon_dandy: @thedocperian actually trueeee especially some stuff past 100 kills me

[0:51:49] buruhas: 📡
[0:52:08] InsaneLoke: i get what u mean, youd rather show off a less known anime
[0:52:09] irediu: frieren should be even more popular
[0:52:11] Yergos: I think frieren deserves the amount of love that it gets, it is REALLY good
[0:52:12] Private_Shorty: I didn't want to put frieren in my 3x3 cause I felt like recency bias has it higher than it might end up being
[0:52:13] Red__2: frieren is just that good
[0:52:14] redactedenheim: Im reading it so I didn't put it on my 3x3
[0:52:15] Kitkattack: I don't think Fri is all that but it's good
[0:52:30] cobatts: frieren the most 7/10
[0:52:33] vera_aisight: i get what you're saying im considering it the same way
[0:52:40] outrunthewind: There's season 2 coming

[1:04:39] chasingperspective11: Kino journey heck yeah
[1:04:40] timinator193: believe it or not lol
[1:04:40] The_Great_Moof: Texhnolyze is way way too edgy to make a 3x3 imo. nobody here's a big enough nihilist.

[1:06:41] InsaneLoke: ur gonna be seeing a lot of patlabor today
[1:06:42] DavidPortnov: Kids on the Slope was so close to making my 3x3. It permanently influenced my music taste.
[1:06:45] The_Great_Moof: my trash anime take is that i super hate all the characters in Steins;Gate. could not get into that anime even after hours of watching it.
[1:06:53] TheDocperian: I'm so sad I couldn't fit Girls' Last Tour on my 3x3
[1:06:56] horribleham: If you are in a vtuber stream it's probably not a deep cut

[1:08:07] borg_to_the_third: Yeah
[1:08:08] irediu: rip
[1:08:12] PSYCOMMUnist: The story is the better part of Gridman than the action
[1:08:18] DavidPortnov: Ultraman is a pretty good gateway though.
[1:08:35] chasingperspective11: Cyperpunk edge runner great as well from trigger
[1:08:38] DavidPortnov: Yeah, the original series.

[1:13:43] DavidPortnov: I love Shinkai, but not all of his movies hit.
[1:13:45] JaAmfan: shinkai is a genuine hack
[1:13:47] sufferingpariah: massively overrated director
[1:13:53] outrunthewind: Shinkai has a formula
[1:13:53] The_Great_Moof: i was a HUGE Makoto Shinkai stan but i've fallen off super hard the last few years.
[1:13:54] Private_Shorty: @deafmutelaughing Wait REALLY? I knew S2+ was ass but I thought S1 was supposed to be good even compared to the manga... if you're telling me it was WORSE
[1:13:56] cobatts: hasn't made anything worthwhile since 5cm per second
[1:13:57] deafmutelaughing: I cried at Suzume, I will admit
[1:14:06] DavidPortnov: @deafmutelaughing Same here. That one hit hard.
[1:14:10] Kitkattack: 5cm is crazy slow drawn out
[1:14:14] DavidPortnov: YEs
[1:14:15] demon_dandy: Yeah
[1:14:16] chasingperspective11: Yes
[1:14:16] The_Great_Moof: yeah
[1:14:17] saigyo1: Hosoda
[1:14:19] demon_dandy: Hosoda
[1:14:30] saigyo1: Hosoda mogs Shinkai HARD
[1:14:32] ScarletRook: Hosada > Shinkai
[1:14:35] Lord_Scrublet: hosoda is great imo
[1:14:35] theSimplechild: Hosoda and Shinkai competing for the public's short attention span
[1:14:35] The_Great_Moof: oh that's Hosoda, his movies are more stylized? if that makes sense?
[1:14:45] haato01: agree, same
[1:14:47] demon_dandy: At least early hosoda, his new stuff ehhh
[1:14:51] DavidPortnov: I need to rewatch Weathering With You.
[1:14:52] JTBun: same
[1:15:09] cobatts: weathering is insane but probably a more interesting movie
[1:15:17] chasingperspective11: Weathering with you very pretty
[1:15:26] deafmutelaughing: @Private_Shorty take my opinion as just my own, I don't think many share it
[1:15:27] chasingperspective11: Summer wars
[1:15:32] The_Great_Moof: well Kimi no Na Wa is just a "cleaner" story. it's easier for a broad audience, less challenging.
[1:15:40] Kitkattack: Asobi is great but so many people got turned away by the first few eps.... ashton51Nightmare
[1:16:01] horribleham: "I need to leave my wife and kids" type moral of the story ashton51Baby
[1:16:16] Lord_Scrublet: asobi is the hardest to watch show that I would consider amazing
[1:16:36] chasingperspective11: All about the family lol
[1:16:38] DavidPortnov: I think you've made a very good point.
[1:16:41] deafmutelaughing: Suzume is largely about the national trauma of the 2011 earthquake
[1:16:43] ImChileanNow: myraNod
[1:16:50] cobatts: it's kinda "don't bother trying to do anything about climate change"
[1:16:52] demon_dandy: Oooo ogre only understand surface themes of tenki no ko like self discovery ashton51Pathetic
[1:17:00] pymiddd: helo rat maesiraChatting
[1:17:02] deafmutelaughing: Mamoru LOVES his motifs
[1:17:03] dax812: @demon_dandy +2

[1:17:12] ImChileanNow: @demon_dandy ashton51Omegalul
[1:17:13] saigyo1: Hosoda's best work is in Doremi
[1:17:17] Kitkattack: ashton51Omegalul
[1:17:22] chasingperspective11: Still love Digimon war game
[1:17:23] Kitkattack: that's awesome DD
[1:17:34] The_Great_Moof: Makoto Shinkai probably spent 90% of his teenage years being sad in Tokyo train stations ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:17:34] JTBun: I fucking hated belle
[1:17:35] keternal: oh yeah that sucked ass tru
[1:17:39] cobatts: hasn't made anything good since summer wars
[1:17:42] chasingperspective11: Sadly too many many times
[1:17:45] demon_dandy: Summer wars was amazing though
[1:17:47] JTBun: belle had good music and visuals at times tho
[1:17:52] JTBun: but the story was ASS
[1:17:52] xicervt: hello everyone anime watchers
[1:17:53] DavidPortnov: Haven't seen Belle. I guess I can count myself lucky.
[1:17:54] fctseventyseven: I asked a friend to watch belle on theatre with me and I felt so embarrassed about it cause it was ass
[1:18:00] DavidPortnov: @xicervt Hello! Welcome in!
[1:18:01] deafmutelaughing: Boy and the Beast is PEKA
[1:18:03] deafmutelaughing: PEAK
[1:18:13] JTBun: no i agree with u

[1:18:31] cobatts: girl who lept through time
[1:18:34] keternal: belle 2?????????????
[1:18:36] ImChileanNow: best Shinkai IMO's still 5cm/s because it's raw youth and regret condensed in 30min, few can achieve the same with so little
[1:18:46] deafmutelaughing: Scarlet
[1:18:46] dax812: My friend told me never to watch Belle cause it was shit
[1:18:52] demon_dandy: Ah it came out and people are ripping it
[1:18:54] fctseventyseven: All the good Hosoda films aren't written by him, after Wolf Children he started writing the scripts himself and they are all bad
[1:18:55] RockLobster52: oh was that new movie by him as well? thought it looked similar
[1:19:02] c14dog: Didnt care for it either
[1:19:05] ImChileanNow: YEAH

[1:21:25] xicervt: Gintama is one the best show if you watch alot of other anime becuse the joke wont hit otherwise
[1:21:30] DavidPortnov: Dandadan is very Ultraman now that you point it out.
[1:21:34] saigyo1: you knew that Ikuhara directed a lot of Sailor Moon right?
[1:21:42] skullvolver: kamen rider on top tbh

[1:31:35] The_Great_Moof: also FMA 2003 over Brotherhood is kinda uncommon.
[1:31:36] DavidPortnov: I remember when Raildex was a THING.
[1:31:43] HmmHrmHarumph: they're watching that all the time in the nursing home
[1:31:43] StarBurst_Stream: mauuDead
[1:31:44] irediu: were they that old ?
[1:31:44] Romblymo: I remember reading all of railgun/index's fan translated novels once the anime ended
[1:31:47] outrunthewind: Railgun is still new, right ashton51Cope
[1:31:52] EmkaZRC: It was big
[1:31:55] xicervt: Railgun and index sure are good until s3
[1:31:56] Qrockpot: railgun > index more cute girls
[1:31:56] RockLobster52: they even made a new virtual-on because of raildex
[1:31:58] StarBurst_Stream: well i meant railgun, but both i guess orooKEKW
[1:31:59] demon_dandy: Index raaan the streets at the end of the 2000s Classic
[1:32:04] Cleareye_: Nagatoro
[1:32:04] Potatoidea: My Railgun experience is liking the OP songs and literally nothing else
[1:32:05] cobatts: nagatoro
[1:32:05] InsaneLoke: its worse
[1:32:05] deafmutelaughing: nagatoro
[1:32:05] irediu: nagatoro ?

[1:32:06] InsaneLoke: tbh
[1:32:07] demon_dandy: Nagatoro
[1:32:08] fctseventyseven: It's way better than nagatoro come on
[1:32:09] ScarletRook: Railgun is getting a new season next year so Raildex is still in  fashion
[1:32:14] redactedenheim: nagatoro is ok
[1:32:14] The_Great_Moof: Raildex was freaking HUGE for like a year.
[1:32:16] Romblymo: index/rail/accel will surely all be animated before I die
[1:32:20] demon_dandy: I mean its more cutesy innocent
[1:32:21] eb0ss1: nagatoroq
[1:32:25] eb0ss1: I love nagatoro
[1:32:27] InsaneLoke: takagi san felt pointless
[1:32:27] ImChileanNow: Nagatoro anime sucks balls, manga is much better
[1:32:27] Private_Shorty: @The_Great_Moof I'm 90% when somebody picks only 1 FMA it's FMA:B unless it's cropped to show the title as the 2003 one LOL
[1:32:30] dax812: Nagatoro manga is really good
[1:32:30] RockLobster52: in the original imagesets yeah
[1:32:32] The_Great_Moof: lol
[1:32:33] bonatide: Nagatoro was terrible
[1:32:37] EmkaZRC: Huh I didn't know that
[1:32:38] irediu: so true ashton
[1:32:40] The_Great_Moof: Nagatoro's better than Takagi
[1:32:45] fctseventyseven: nagatoro was masochist fetish stuff early on tbh lol
[1:32:47] ImChileanNow: Takagi-san anime is like a lunch anime, it's there
[1:32:49] Qrockpot: true nagatoro anime played it safe
[1:32:50] irediu: nagatoro was straight up evil
[1:32:50] HmmHrmHarumph: Nagatoro manga would make my 3x3
[1:32:57] RockLobster52: yuuuuuup
[1:32:57] ImChileanNow: I think Takagi-san is for a mood, Nagatoro is for another
[1:32:58] cobatts: takagi is kinda just fluff. nagatoro is fetish content
[1:32:58] StarBurst_Stream: but my boy won in the end LETSGOOO
[1:32:59] bonatide: Takagi was good, people just hate good fun
[1:33:00] Drury277: bottom row is for zoomers masquerading as ojisans
[1:33:02] InsaneLoke: it was awesome
[1:33:03] deafmutelaughing: I watched the first few episodes of Takagi and liked it enough but yeah not for me
[1:33:05] dax812: The anime didn’t go on long enough for the good parts of Nagatoro’s character so everyone thinks she’s a bitch ashton51Squish
[1:33:12] Cleareye_: The webcomic was definitely a harassment fetish
[1:33:12] outrunthewind: Takagi likes to tease, Nagatoro is a bully
[1:33:15] xicervt: fullpanic sure is fun to watch every now then they got serious
[1:33:16] theSimplechild: Nagatoro manga also took away some of her bite iirc. The first chapter/episode she's straight up cruel.
[1:33:21] DavidPortnov: @Drury277 +2
[1:33:24] ImChileanNow: I watched 2 seasons of Takagi-san and went to the manga, it's aight
[1:33:28] keternal: the takagi sequel manga is really cute
[1:33:32] HmmHrmHarumph: first chapter of Nagatoro is the peak I love it. She fucking destroyed that guy
[1:33:32] Senoquese: yea if you enjoy nagatoro you gotta admit its fetish stuff atleast ashton51ICANT
[1:33:33] InsaneLoke: well theres a sequel where they are married lmfao, it started before the main series finished
[1:33:37] ImChileanNow: the best thing out of Takagi-san was making a path for BokuYaba
[1:33:46] Senoquese: TRUEEEE
[1:33:48] redactedenheim: Lots of people didn't like Fumofu
[1:33:50] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[1:33:51] Mace492: LETS GO
[1:33:51] dax812: Nagatoro def started as a bullying fetish and then he realized he had a good romcom
[1:33:51] Senoquese: i enjoyed darker than black way more than fmp
[1:33:52] DavidPortnov: They do go hand in hand...

[1:34:25] EmkaZRC: That was a common theory but it was kind of debunked
[1:34:31] HashiriyaR32: I was surprised when one of the HoloEn 3D rewinds made a Darker than Black reference
[1:34:32] TurtleSheen: are you saying Railgun isn't timeless?
[1:34:36] redactedenheim: Redacted "Aged By Railgun" Enheim

[1:37:01] outrunthewind: There are SO MANY MEMES from Arakawa that most people don't even realize
[1:37:01] demon_dandy: Madoka another series that ran the city at the turn of the decade

[1:39:50] saigyo1: you can tell Arakawa is directed by Shinbou
[1:39:54] cobatts: that's right
[1:39:55] demon_dandy: The themes Classic

[1:42:52] SouthWeast: rerorerorero
[1:42:54] deafmutelaughing: I like part 4 better but I can't understand disliking 3
[1:42:56] HmmHrmHarumph: Part 3 is aliright
[1:42:59] Calmo_Ho: part 3 is what I think of when I think jojo
[1:43:02] skeletom_ch: Did Kakyoin lay this egg??? 👉🥚
[1:43:06] EmkaZRC: Solid ya
[1:43:12] beat_shobon: Also love Cromartie High School, my beloveds
[1:43:12] bonatide: Its the most mid
[1:43:12] ImChileanNow: its not bad but it's not the best
[1:43:13] Yergos: I liked the movie version of part 3 more
[1:43:19] Senoquese: i can understand really hating some part 3 episodes but the WHOLE part?
[1:43:19] fctseventyseven: Part 2 is the best
[1:43:21] DavidPortnov: Part 3 is when it becomes itself.
[1:43:22] bonatide: Pt 3 is the baseline
[1:43:23] dynamozx05: oooh you're not tricking anyone, you've read that thing the Clamp made about Kakyoin laying an egg
[1:43:24] EmkaZRC: Part 3 is weak
[1:43:26] demon_dandy: Yeah im at a point where i like the ova morw
[1:43:27] Kitkattack: a lot of part 3 they are just wandering around a desert
[1:43:31] TurtleSheen: Part 2 is best
[1:43:33] The_Great_Moof: i think people forgot the funny & fun parts of part 3
[1:43:34] w0wells: agreed, part 4's murder mystery thriller plot is just my fav
[1:43:35] turtlespook: how did part 6 turn out incidentally? been thinking of catching up
[1:43:36] res_ipsa_: really like part 3, just a little too villain-of-the-week at times. Still great though
[1:43:38] Red__2: part is so important folks say to skip part 1 and 2 to get to it ashton51Despair
[1:43:40] Redcrafter: Redcrafter subscribed with Prime. 
[1:43:42] Calmo_Ho: a lot of rage baiters in chat
[1:43:53] InsaneLoke: part 1 movie
[1:43:54] chasingperspective11: Ova is awesome
[1:43:57] JTBun: I just think out of all the parts, part 3 had the best characters lmao
[1:43:58] JaAmfan: the proper gore in the ova>>>>
[1:44:00] cobatts: wasn't part 1 the lost media?
[1:44:02] deafmutelaughing: still boggles my mind that the OVA finale was directed by Satoshi Kon
[1:44:07] ImChileanNow: the only part I was kinda "ehh" was 5 because of too many loose ends, Giorno felt like a cork to shut Shueisha up
[1:44:18] Senoquese: @turtlespook i really didnt enjoy watching part 6 i tried 3 times and i love jolyne but it lost the jojo charm imo
[1:44:20] Private_Shorty: I think that's totally fair yeah. 3 is good on it's own but it setting up literally everything else for the next 3 parts is super influential
[1:44:23] StarBurst_Stream: gopissgirl
[1:44:26] The_Great_Moof: WHAT
[1:44:29] cho__aniki: @turtlespook Netflix's release strategy of putting an entire season out all at once killed the hype and I think they had to reuse part 3 tracks near the end
[1:44:31] demon_dandy: Those ova cuts are so brutal
[1:44:36] xicervt: i got to say God Eater the animation is my number one anime where the animation is on fire tho i never see people talking about it
[1:44:38] DenpaDesu: DenpaDesu redeemed awww for 1000 Bits 
[1:44:47] dynamozx05: the 90s JoJo OVAs walked so the David Production Series could run
[1:44:49] The_Great_Moof: holy shit i need to rewatch it
[1:44:49] deafmutelaughing: I didn't put any Jojo on mine because I only read the manga
[1:44:55] Kitkattack: wtf was those dogs
[1:44:59] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[1:45:00] JaAmfan: @dynamozx05 other way around
[1:45:04] chasingperspective11: Lololool
[1:45:04] InsaneLoke: cromarie is very navy
[1:45:09] The_Great_Moof: Cromartie is so fun
[1:45:20] DavidPortnov: It's a crossover show for sure.
[1:45:25] cho__aniki: being meguca is suffering
[1:45:26] ImChileanNow: generational?
[1:45:40] turtlespook: "deconstruction of the xyz genre"
[1:45:51] cobatts: karaoke time
[1:46:13] res_ipsa_: holy shit, haven't thought Madoka Ante Up in a long time lol
[1:46:18] murderdeathki1l: lol
[1:46:20] ImChileanNow: did you see that ragebait yt "essay" where there's no mahoushoujo for girls between Sailor Moon and Meguca? soyoKEKW
[1:46:28] murderdeathki1l: nothing like some good torture
[1:46:31] Kitkattack: dog at least it's not mahou shoujo site
[1:46:31] The_Great_Moof: lol
[1:46:31] xicervt: Madoka is amazing tho
[1:46:34] HmmHrmHarumph: I didn't like Madoka for that reason :)
[1:46:40] JaAmfan: there has not been a single intelligent or contextual opinion on madoka posted to the internet
[1:46:40] bonatide: The progenitor is typically rhe best tho
[1:46:42] RockLobster52: I think I'm alone in not liking madoka much
[1:46:42] StarBurst_Stream: eggymi1YEPPERS
[1:46:47] demon_dandy: he killed people and enjoyed doin itttt
[1:46:49] murderdeathki1l: its character building
[1:46:55] horribleham: It's sinless because it was good
[1:47:01] Senoquese: LMFAOOO
[1:47:05] ImChileanNow: I think Madoka is ok (rated it 10)
[1:47:10] The_Great_Moof: OH GOD
[1:47:13] dynamozx05: Madoka as a magical girl series subvertion was great on Its own, my only gripe is the flood of angsty magical girl shows that tortured girls for the sake of shock value rather than existential and philosophical well thought topics like Madoka did
[1:47:14] The_Great_Moof: I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
[1:47:16] Kitkattack: you are the singular Aldnoah stan
[1:47:19] StarBurst_Stream: Classic
[1:47:21] ImChileanNow: like you can not like something personally but you can appreciate the craft
[1:47:23] saigyo1: you seen Urobuchi's Phantom?
[1:47:23] xicervt: and i hate Magical girl stuff and but Madoka and Sailor moon are the only one i gave the chance too
[1:47:24] murderdeathki1l: so true
[1:47:29] cobatts: loool
[1:47:30] Cleareye_: What will win a chinchilla's ADD or a chilla's small bladder?
[1:47:32] demon_dandy: They makin von memes out of urobutcher if his era was current
[1:47:33] murderdeathki1l: no one is innocent
[1:47:34] HarrisonFjord: HarrisonFjord subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! urobuchi moves like king von when he writes women
[1:47:34] buruhas: what I forgot Urobutcher wrote Aldnoah/Zero, he fumbled
[1:47:41] ImChileanNow: @xicervt try Precure. Trust.
[1:47:43] outrunthewind: And thus started another hour of Slain torture discussion
[1:47:43] cobatts: hi fjord
[1:47:44] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:47:45] DavidPortnov: I liked it... Didn't love it, but I enjoyed it.
[1:47:50] JaAmfan: @buruhas he only wrote the first ep
[1:47:51] fixedspectacles2014: ashton51Smile
[1:48:06] deafmutelaughing: ashton51Omegalul
[1:48:06] xicervt: @ImChileanNow Precure omg i gotfot about that show its amazing too
[1:48:24] xicervt: @xicervt sorry fat fingers
[1:48:29] theSimplechild: @buruhas I think his involvement halted pretty early into the story, like 4 episodes in
[1:48:30] ImChileanNow: Mahou Shoujo of the End? nyanomSmile
[1:48:37] Senoquese: i wanna watch the suffering anime but i cry too easily
[1:48:41] RockLobster52: there's artistic merit in it, but I just couldn't watch because it's too depressing
[1:48:44] fctseventyseven: I remember urobuchi writing this a random show called gunslinger stratos and realizing my goat was washed
[1:48:49] murderdeathki1l: it made me uncomfortable its bad
[1:48:51] EmkaZRC: Madoka is to magical girls show what Evangelion is to mecha show. I like both btw but it's true
[1:49:03] demon_dandy: it did frustrate me how cynical it was with some of the characters
[1:49:07] HashiriyaR32: Wasn't Gunslinger Stratos an arcade game?
[1:49:12] RokuwaNeoro: Yeah, that's an anime of an arcade game
[1:49:12] DavidPortnov: @fctseventyseven I didn't know he wrote that. It's also been on my list for so long.
[1:49:14] ImChileanNow: its a game
[1:49:16] analmcgoober: Bleak anime where peeps die for the fun of it, bad anime
[1:49:17] ImChileanNow: but it was an anime too
[1:49:17] horribleham: It's bad because they made the girls suffer for a mid anime. Madoka was peam, and therefore is ontologicaly good
[1:49:25] RokuwaNeoro: A super rad arcade game but the anime wasn't great from what I remember
[1:49:31] cobatts: urobuchi writes the first episode of a lot of things. can't blame him for much
[1:49:37] fctseventyseven: @DavidPortnov keep it there
[1:49:38] dynamozx05: if you like Urobochi's writing and henshin/tokusatsu stuff, you should watch Blassreiter, It's basically Kamen Rider in Germany
[1:49:39] Private_Shorty: Woah woah woah Gushing is an entirely different show
[1:49:40] murderdeathki1l: the girls are not real spoiler alert
[1:49:43] ImChileanNow: bro revived a buried memory, I watched Gunslinger Stratos nininOmegaLUL
[1:49:53] DavidPortnov: @fctseventyseven  ashton51Noted
[1:49:54] xicervt: i am sure there was another Magical Girl show that was really good to been a while tho since i watch Magical girl show
[1:49:57] deafmutelaughing: I didn't like gushing but not for that reason
[1:49:57] saigyo1: Urobuchi can be washed but he's forever forgiven for Phantom
[1:49:58] outrunthewind: OK, the thing about Madoka is that when it aired the first time, it was not a trope yet to literally brutally murder your magical girls, so it had a big impact. Then it started a trend and people were spoiled about it and now it doesn't hit as hard
[1:50:05] irediu: gushing is not grimdark no ?
[1:50:17] mareeples: @outrunthewind Yeah, Madoka was novel. It's like how Familiar of Zero gets some cred in isekai rankings.
[1:50:21] ImChileanNow: it is trash
[1:50:22] DavidPortnov: @saigyo1 He wrote that too!? Another one that's always been on my list.
[1:50:27] ImChileanNow: not trash like garbage but trash the genre
[1:50:31] Kitkattack: the manga of gushing is so much more tame man
[1:50:33] RokuwaNeoro: @dynamozx05 Oh hey, somone else that knows Blassreiter exists. Caveat: only watch till the halfway point
[1:50:36] JaAmfan: @outrunthewind minky momo
[1:50:39] Kitkattack: they just made it into porn
[1:50:41] ImChileanNow: it is
[1:50:43] horribleham: Gushing is actually a really cute yuri
[1:50:49] RockLobster52: LMAO
[1:50:50] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:50:52] ImChileanNow: somehow the anime turned it into a 300% coomer anime
[1:50:56] saigyo1: @DavidPortnov oh yes. it's excellent!!
[1:50:56] DavidPortnov: @RokuwaNeoro Ok, now that's one I do know he wrote. Love that show!
[1:50:58] RockLobster52: oh right that's the ending huh
[1:51:02] Potatoidea: So it's like isekai where someone does something new and within a month it's a new subgenre?
[1:51:07] EmkaZRC: Madoka is definitely good
[1:51:08] JaAmfan: true
[1:51:08] murderdeathki1l: oh shit lol
[1:51:14] murderdeathki1l: damn
[1:51:15] xicervt: i have to look at my list of anime i watch is up to the 2k now
[1:51:15] StarBurst_Stream: hes does tho Clueless
[1:51:17] horribleham: The manga is more tame in the way you dint have to sit there in the ecchi scene for 10 minutes
[1:51:18] theSimplechild: Honestly the anime for Gushing understands why you're there in the first place
[1:51:25] Kitkattack: same is true of ishuzoku, anime is waaaaaay lewder
[1:51:26] saigyo1: fuck yes Tutu

[1:51:55] demon_dandy: I heard conflicting on it too
[1:51:55] xicervt: Bocchi Kaiji Nichjou sensei
[1:51:56] EmkaZRC: Kaiji best girl
[1:51:59] DavidPortnov: I loved Zetsubou Sensei at the time, might not today.
[1:52:00] murderdeathki1l: hes super straight
[1:52:02] Kitkattack: your favorite tutu
[1:52:02] keternal: higurashi gou/sotsu are completely pointless if you've played umineko imo
[1:52:06] StarBurst_Stream: LOL\
[1:52:07] Jasuchin: Oh heck, I'm late
[1:52:08] Kitkattack: Utena is the shit
[1:52:15] demon_dandy: zetsubou sensei lfg
[1:52:18] Qrockpot: Kaiji is MOE
[1:52:19] ImChileanNow: Kaiji is Saki but better
[1:52:34] Potatoidea: LOL
[1:52:38] ImChileanNow: nah Akagi is kinda wack I prefer Kaiji
[1:52:40] dynamozx05: @RokuwaNeoro yea, the ending was a bit odd but It was one of his first scripts so, I can forgive that, It's free to watch on Gonzo's youtube channel with subs btw
[1:52:40] xicervt: Higurashi is still king i would recommend it to any first anime watchers
[1:52:41] ImChileanNow: it's about the aura
[1:52:45] ImChileanNow: no you're right
[1:52:45] RockLobster52: Kaiji does play Mahjong
[1:52:46] Potatoidea: You're correct
[1:52:48] Jasuchin: Did I miss mine?
[1:52:49] demon_dandy: Thats exactly it
[1:52:56] murderdeathki1l: am i insane lol
[1:52:56] Potatoidea: In the manga
[1:52:57] res_ipsa_: Kaiji plays mahjong in the manga :^)
[1:52:57] RockLobster52: the part RIGHT AFTER THE ANIME ENDS
[1:52:57] keternal: higurashi is naku koro ni 1-2 and umineko is 3-4, there's a really bad anime of the first half of umineko too
[1:53:01] Kitkattack: kaji has a mahjong bit
[1:53:05] redactedenheim: insane but right
[1:53:09] Senoquese: LOL
[1:53:19] StarBurst_Stream: are you doing everyone ash POGGIES
[1:53:31] beat_shobon: Very true
[1:53:42] Potatoidea: Subtleness?
[1:53:47] xicervt: its just a depression show
[1:53:53] dynamozx05: I remember a friend once telling me I looked like Nozomu Itoshiki
[1:54:08] ImChileanNow: limiting content because of the west piffle3NOPPERS ngmi
[1:54:10] demon_dandy: Ich ben didden bludden?
[1:54:14] keternal: if you like zetsubou-sensei check out kakushigoto by the same author, it's pretty different but it's good
[1:54:15] xicervt: but i like it zetsubo sensei Depression sure makes a good anime
[1:54:18] StarBurst_Stream: ashton51Nodders
[1:54:22] outrunthewind: Negima was the shota one
[1:54:33] DavidPortnov: The funny thing is that Zetsubou Sensei just got released in the West officially for the first time recently.
[1:54:35] ImChileanNow: they actually do nowadays, anime production is terribly expensive too
[1:54:48] Kitkattack: that shit in dedededede caught me really off guard ashton51Despair
[1:55:00] demon_dandy: kakushigoto still got his type of joke but different cut of humor ashton51Tehe

[1:56:50] EmkaZRC: I understand what you mean
[1:56:52] Vidyuu: it's hard to describe
[1:56:54] The_Great_Moof: demi-chan was kinda cute but it felt like it was 80% fluff, i gotta think hard to remember it
[1:56:55] DavidPortnov: Same here. It was very off-the-wall.
[1:56:57] cobatts: rumba rumba rumba
[1:56:58] RockLobster52: yeah

[1:57:29] ImChileanNow: why would you need to do that, it only demeans the work
[1:57:31] fctseventyseven: the author making drawing smut of the hot succubus teacher was the best part of demi-chan
[1:57:42] HashiriyaR32: "I'm in despair! [X] has left me in despair!"
[1:57:48] RockLobster52: isn't that always
[1:57:49] ImChileanNow: well it's their issue being stupid not mine
[1:57:53] EmkaZRC: ItsTrue
[1:57:55] ImChileanNow: nah it's definitely the editor/publisher
[1:57:58] DavidPortnov: @HashiriyaR32 The memories are flooding back.
[1:58:11] murderdeathki1l: is it supposed to be humorous?
[1:58:14] Potatoidea: That Tumblr video where there's a big "THIS IS BAD" warning over Scarface
[1:58:35] Qrockpot: im surprised there wasnt a tsukommi char that brought it up
[1:58:36] EmkaZRC: I love this era where people can't tell the difference between fiction and reality and get mad at you for knowing the difference
[1:58:41] Romblymo: Its the game dev paradox where you need to be explanatory

[2:09:42] SoulPatchAdams: didn’t see s2
[2:09:45] StarBurst_Stream: it was great
[2:09:48] ImChileanNow: it was disliked because they can't see the beauty in trash anime
[2:09:50] RockLobster52: the game for punchline was kind of disappointing, but the story itself seemed okay
[2:09:52] HarrisonFjord: I didn't particularly fw punchline

[2:09:54] demon_dandy: I WAS THE SAME i didnt hate it but it didnt leave an impression
[2:09:55] MelvinSoupreme: punchline has sora amamiya? i remember trying it but couldn't make it through
[2:09:57] Kitkattack: I love the look of punchline but i can't say that the story was good

[2:10:11] keternal: punch line was fun and i think if anyone likes AI somnium files and dislikes punch line that's very ??????
[2:10:14] theSimplechild: I think Punchline is Kotaru Uchikoshi's singular foray into anime
[2:10:24] jherchin12345: a figure of her would be so top heavy
[2:10:33] Kitkattack: Punchline opened great but didn't keep up the pace at allllll
[2:10:50] demon_dandy: I did love the world ot conveyed
[2:10:51] chasingperspective11: Kekkai didn't do for me

[2:14:09] ThatAdde: Durarara annoyed me with how it told its story
[2:14:12] DavidPortnov: @TheDocperian +2

[2:22:29] Kitkattack: KLK is so exciting and fun, like you can't think to hard about theming but it's epic
[2:22:32] Yergos: i remember kill la kill being so massive when it came out, I watched it while it aired
[2:22:38] cobatts: wotakoi
[2:22:42] ImChileanNow: it felt flat because it wasn't either a MOTW nor a continuous story with engaging elements, even if the characters are amazing in isolation
[2:22:44] demon_dandy: LOL
[2:22:46] StarBurst_Stream: ashton51Alien

[2:26:10] ImChileanNow: they are very square
[2:26:13] redactedenheim: ok maybe Im remembering the manga
[2:26:14] eb0ss1: pit crew anime club would be very enticing… yall have such good taste
[2:26:17] beribug: only anime ive ever rewatched were nozaki kun, JOJOs, and YuGiOh GX
[2:26:24] ImChileanNow: I think you hate Wotakoi because it got that yaoi lineart but it's straight romance
[2:26:26] DavidPortnov: @eb0ss1 I'd be into that.
[2:26:28] EmkaZRC: I haven't watched it but I had never heard someone shit on it lol

[2:27:17] beribug: only anime ive ever rewatched were nozaki kun, JOJOs, and YuGiOh GX (AND ssssdynazenon)
[2:27:19] Potatoidea: Is it just people posting Zero Two again?
[2:27:21] redactedenheim: one dimension done well is better than three dimensions done poorly
[2:27:25] Private_Shorty: IT WAS ONLY GOOD FOR LIKE 12 EPISODES AND EVEN THAT'S DEBATEABLE
[2:27:27] dax812: I liked Franxx and SAO like potato chips it was fun but not great
[2:27:30] vtuberacingcorp: It was never good...
[2:27:32] redactedenheim: I HATE Darling in the Franxx
[2:27:34] Kitkattack: hidden gem ashton51Nightmare franxx guys listen

[2:27:45] eb0ss1: FRANXX was 10/10 until ep15 and I will die on that hill
[2:27:47] redactedenheim: SAO I love tho
[2:27:47] EmkaZRC: People are defending Darling in the Franxx????
[2:27:50] InsaneLoke: franxx was the first anime i ever dropped
[2:27:50] fctseventyseven: I felt so vindicated about hating franxx from ep3 when it ended and everyone hated it
[2:27:51] MelvinSoupreme: nishigori fell off...
[2:27:57] chasingperspective11: zero two or power from chainsaw man
[2:28:04] The_Great_Moof: oh fuuuuu DariFura triggering me again
[2:28:11] Potatoidea: @chasingperspective11 Power
[2:28:13] beribug: I ALSO AM NOT INTERESTED AT ALL IN KILL LA KILL IM SO SORRY I LOVE OTHER TRIGGER MEDIA I JUST CANNOT STAND THE IDEA OF KLK
[2:28:14] Kitkattack: franxx is pretty, everything about the story and characters and fucking in the robot is soooooo asssssss
[2:28:20] vtuberacingcorp: SAO does have some interesting stuff, but it sets expectations really poorly, and not everyone is into where they're going.
[2:28:20] HmmHrmHarumph: but Dungeon Meshi is the peak????
[2:28:32] Bubsla: Franks has robots that have boobs.
[2:28:39] xicervt: i one those who hate SAO
[2:28:40] Potatoidea: Metalcore OP
[2:28:41] cobatts: death note really needs the OST
[2:28:43] demon_dandy: Trigger slander gotta stop atp
[2:28:43] yojamjam: death note's sound design is so awesome
[2:28:44] Bubsla: Gundam with boobs
[2:28:46] Potatoidea: The MAD classic
[2:28:47] dax812: Deathnote manga is so beautiful but then the anime somehow is just as beautiful
[2:28:48] jherchin12345: but you get the I take a chip AND EAT IT memes
[2:28:50] InsaneLoke: FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT... trigger doesnt take themselves seriously and so they feel half assed
[2:28:54] vtuberacingcorp: The latest SAO light novel stuff is crazy good, but there's not an insignificant amount of mid.
[2:29:02] beribug: the thing is im also a seiyuu pervert so i only ever consume media with my scrimblos
[2:29:06] deafmutelaughing: do you feel that way about Promare?
[2:29:06] dax812: I HATE how Deathnote became a prominent audio for tiktoks
[2:29:08] The_Great_Moof: idk i used to hate SAO haters but that was 2018. if you still hate SAO, you probably actually genuinely dislike it.
[2:29:10] hottungsten: my favorite thing about death note is that they put the entire manga into a single book
[2:29:11] xicervt: i dont get what people like about a mister nice guy Character Like Kirito SAO was so boring
[2:29:15] Kitkattack: people love to hate trigger bruuuu
[2:29:15] bonatide: The live action death note really cemented it as peak for me
[2:29:16] Senoquese: yeaaaa
[2:29:17] F1nalStarman: There was so much hype around Franxx, so when it didn't live up to expectations, I think some folks were searching for reasons to like it so they wouldn't have to face their disappointment head on
[2:29:19] InsaneLoke: it gets to a point where
[2:29:30] beribug: no lock into gridman universe bruhhhh
[2:29:30] used_sock1: but inferno cop was peak
[2:29:38] HmmHrmHarumph: Kill la Kill was their first show. Are you saying it was over before it even started?
[2:29:41] soggytelescope: i think they just need better writers to back up their amazing visuals
[2:29:43] demon_dandy: Is this about like two shows of their catalogue?
[2:29:45] vtuberacingcorp: I saw the first Gridman, it was fun.
[2:29:50] DavidPortnov: @xicervt The thing that I liked initially was just the overall concept... but .hack also already did that. SAO is just modern .hack.
[2:29:51] deafmutelaughing: everyone forgot Promare...
[2:29:52] beat_shobon: Gridman and Dynazenon are great
[2:29:53] redactedenheim: well we like Rikka
[2:29:55] EmkaZRC: Gridman is okay
[2:29:59] eb0ss1: trigger needs another inferno cop /s
[2:30:01] Kitkattack: how does everyone assume that imaishi was just always better before Trigger
[2:30:01] InsaneLoke: @Kitkattack I've literally never seen people criticize them people go to bat for them about how its all ironic so you can't ever fault them
[2:30:06] beribug: i like dynazenon a lot
[2:30:08] InsaneLoke: LOL

[2:30:17] timinator193: Oh
[2:30:18] yojamjam: trigger defenders explain kiznaiver
[2:30:20] Bubsla: I like the super Sentai anime reboot type shows
[2:30:25] Private_Shorty: @vtuberacingcorp The only SAO content I will actually defend is Alicization. That whole arc was kinda awesome (and guess why)
[2:30:27] jherchin12345: what do you mean darling in the franxx is peak anime throat8Imp

[2:30:48] dax812: BNA was good but that ending was so shit
[2:30:51] Potatoidea: I wish the rest of BNA was like the baseball ep
[2:30:52] jherchin12345: @beribug x
[2:30:52] DavidPortnov: @xicervt Yes!
[2:30:53] ImChileanNow: I think it's great but the end was ehh
[2:30:55] WumblyGrumbly: everyone is perverted...

[2:31:22] Senoquese: bna would have been a 10/10 for me if they didnt rush the hell out of the mid ending
[2:31:23] DavidPortnov: @xicervt *sigh* Yeah.
[2:31:25] vtuberacingcorp: @Private_Shorty There's good stuff before that, GGO for example, and the Aincrad arc. But yeah Alicization is the start of the crystalization of where SAO is going.
[2:31:32] ImChileanNow: she did AnoHana so she deserves double the mockery
[2:31:34] eb0ss1: maquia
[2:31:35] theSimplechild: Maquia is her magnum opus imo
[2:31:36] HarrisonFjord: Mari Okada made Iron Blooded Orphans and I'll never forgive her for it LMAO
[2:31:37] vtuberacingcorp: Unital Ring and Progressive are crazy good.
[2:31:37] saigyo1: that's a good show
[2:31:41] ImChileanNow: Maquia is her best stuff
[2:31:43] demon_dandy: kiznaiver is weird cause i got no love for it but i did watch it all

[2:44:03] EmkaZRC: That's the berserk movies
[2:44:05] RockLobster52: wait bleach and naruto but no one piece?
[2:44:06] TheDocperian: Bleach is peak hype moments & aura
[2:44:08] TheComfyPanda: leave us Bleach enjoyers alone argamaPomcomf
[2:44:10] cobatts: out of everything here bleach kinda fucks
[2:44:10] Private_Shorty: Thousand Year Blood war is kinda fucking hype
[2:44:11] beribug: bleach has a lot of nostalgia i think
[2:44:11] リードジャイロツェッペリン: YOOOO ASHTON NICE RAM
[2:44:12] soggytelescope: early bleach is so good
[2:44:16] Romblymo: A lot of us grew up with bleach
[2:44:16] Red__2: > timinator with their shonen-shaped neck
[2:44:18] ImChileanNow: newest Bleach season is not THAT Bleach
[2:44:19] beribug: LMFAOOOOOO BLEACH IS THE BEST???? LMFAOOOOO
[2:44:20] nacko_yo: i think bleach is good
[2:44:21] fctseventyseven: it has the hottest characters
[2:44:21] InsaneLoke: bleach sucks naruto sucks
[2:44:25] theSimplechild: Yeah this is the kind of 3x3 that makes you go "you gotta watch more anime dude"
[2:44:27] timinator193: @RockLobster52 yeah but you have to actually watch one piece
[2:44:28] The_Great_Moof: it's not even close. i say as someone who stanned Bleach for like 20 years.
[2:44:29] Romblymo: because it aired on Jetex if you were in Canada
[2:44:31] insomniyawn: i love bleach but its the only one of the big three i could sit thru when i was younger
[2:44:31] chasingperspective11: bleach have the art style
[2:44:34] InsaneLoke: bleach does have the hottest character
[2:44:35] TheDocperian: I read Bleach for the first time recently, it has zero substance but was really fun
[2:44:36] Chadworthy_: lol
[2:44:36] TheComfyPanda: Bleach has its moments, I like it despite the bloat
[2:44:37] RockLobster52: I was kind of tempted to put bleach on mine, but it was more formative rather than being that far up my favorites
[2:44:38] insomniyawn: so im biased
[2:44:41] chasingperspective11: oolololol
[2:44:43] リードジャイロツェッペリン: bleach is pretty good its the worst thing ever made
[2:44:43] Cleareye_: The Bleach Highs were the highest. The Bleach lows were the lowest.
[2:44:43] DavidPortnov: I was a Naruto-head.
[2:44:46] InsaneLoke: no im saying it cause im a JJK fan
[2:44:47] mareeples: The first arc of Bleach is amazing, but the filler ashton51Despair
[2:44:49] Potatoidea: Overlord in the middle
[2:44:51] saigyo1: one piece babies savehyEvil
[2:44:52] timinator193: Literally just watched it all the way through with a friend
[2:44:54] Private_Shorty: Early Bleach is ass, as somebody who recently started watching it. It's literally nothing but hype moments and aura but the "hype" is 3 slides a minute
[2:45:00] リードジャイロツェッペリン: bleach had alot of bad filler
[2:45:01] jherchin12345: out of the big 3 bleach was kinda the most mid for me. it was good but not the best
[2:45:01] ImChileanNow: Bleach manga is much better, Naruto is wack because it takes away it's own morale, OP is also wack because it takes 320 episodes to be entertaining and it loops the same scene for 60 seconds
[2:45:02] insomniyawn: nelliel was my lesbian awakening
[2:45:03] リードジャイロツェッペリン: honestly
[2:45:04] ScarletRook: Its so revisionist LOL everyone is just being struck with amnesia. Kubo has great style with casual clothes tho
[2:45:07] vtuberacingcorp: I got baited by watching Burn the Witch which was fire, and then I found out it was Bleach.
[2:45:09] buruhas: Counting how many 3x3s are after this one on discord only 😑 (trying not to laugh)
[2:45:09] EmkaZRC: I really like Bleach but it's definitely hype moment and aura. It definitely goes downhill after Soul Society
[2:45:10] DavidPortnov: @Private_Shorty Thank you! Yes!
[2:45:10] The_Great_Moof: Bleach was so sexy & cool but each arc got worse & worse until the last arc was just kinda ass.
[2:45:12] InsaneLoke: early bleach js the best
[2:45:15] Potatoidea: lol
[2:45:15] xicervt: One Piece is boring Naruto shippudden is meh Bleach beat them both
[2:45:16] cobatts: If bleach ended after like 60 episodes it'd be outstanding
[2:45:19] InsaneLoke: overlord though? idk
[2:45:20] chasingperspective11: Naruto my most favorite but one piece recent chapters now one piece most favorite
[2:45:23] DerSeelander: What, it fits so well with the others?
[2:45:23] beribug: im the biggest attack on titan hater im sorry
[2:45:24] Red__2: it did draaag on for a few seasons, simply skip it by reading the manga ashton51Hehe
[2:45:25] RockLobster52: hell yeah
[2:45:26] The_Great_Moof: lol
[2:45:26] ImChileanNow: Bleach manga* is good
[2:45:31] okamistuff: @beribug ???
[2:45:31] EmkaZRC: It's true and you should say it
[2:45:34] chasingperspective11: bleach aura farming
[2:45:35] InsaneLoke: @cobatts ur right too
[2:45:41] リードジャイロツェッペリン: i disagree it needed the shonen slop
[2:45:41] kmxlink: it has an entire season of filler
[2:45:43] F1nalStarman: That's true of most shonen though ashton51Omegalul
[2:45:45] ImChileanNow: Renji
[2:45:47] cobatts: justice for rukia
[2:45:48] timinator193: I hate rukia
[2:45:49] リードジャイロツェッペリン: OH COME ON
[2:45:49] EmkaZRC: Renji yeah
[2:45:50] TheDocperian: Nah I love that it had a good m/f friendship
[2:45:57] timinator193: genuinely dumb
[2:45:58] ImChileanNow: Rukia deserved less
[2:45:58] The_Great_Moof: Ichi-Hime's fine but it's the most vanilla ship.
[2:45:59] xicervt: yeah i wanted Ichigo Rukia
[2:46:00] eb0ss1: rukia 😭😭😭😭😭😭 so kyoooot
[2:46:01] cobatts: ichigo rukia
[2:46:05] EmkaZRC: I never had a problem with the canon ship
[2:46:05] リードジャイロツェッペリン: i like the way it happened
[2:46:06] RockLobster52: I think Orihime is what Ichigo needed, but I still do prefer Rukia and love her chemistry with Ichigo
[2:46:06] kmxlink: if bleach had left filler it would be so much better
[2:46:06] ScarletRook: It should have been Ichigo and Rukia!! Kubo created poetry with them!! The Sun & Moon!
[2:46:09] Jasuchin: I'm fine with Orihime, I saw it coming from a mile away
[2:46:10] sufferingpariah: Orihime GANG
[2:46:12] ScarletRook: gets me so mad
[2:46:13] demon_dandy: I mean this 3x3 is probably the most coherent though, thats bonus points
[2:46:16] Private_Shorty: Nah Rukia works better as the friend those people are lame (she's the best girl though)
[2:46:16] リードジャイロツェッペリン: ichigo rukia makes no sense
[2:46:22] chasingperspective11: lolololol
[2:46:23] jherchin12345: BASED
[2:46:24] EmkaZRC: Rukia best girl
[2:46:26] リードジャイロツェッペリン: Chad renji is pretty good too
[2:46:27] timinator193: She tries to kill herself at least twics and she plot armours through
[2:46:27] InsaneLoke: ichigo rukia was what i wanted when i read in middleschool
[2:46:28] xicervt: but then the girl in the last arc i like too
[2:46:42] InsaneLoke: orihime just never felt like a full character
[2:46:43] ImChileanNow: people who believe in Ichigo Rukia believe any girl being nice is onto them piffle3NOPPERS
[2:46:44] EmkaZRC: IT IS!
[2:46:46] cobatts: tight
[2:46:47] xicervt: forgot her name

[2:47:04] EmkaZRC: Yeah he's really good at characters designs
[2:47:05] InsaneLoke: its definitely the hottest shonen
[2:47:05] RockLobster52: preferred the character designs more at the start before his style became more refined
[2:47:07] nacko_yo: rukia was always meant to be with renji
[2:47:10] eb0ss1: iirc it’s taito kubo
[2:47:11] Kitkattack: he def has a sense of style, the coordinating of swords and powers and fits
[2:47:17] Kazuma_Cathode: Bleach taught me about what Body types I like...
[2:47:21] buruhas: People always nitpick about Kubo's lack of background art
[2:47:21] EmkaZRC: I love Bleach but I HATE Naruto
[2:47:23] リードジャイロツェッペリン: hmmm
[2:47:24] JTBun: girl swear all you want
[2:47:26] JaAmfan: the designs he did for the new sakura wars were really good but the 3d models didnt do them justice
[2:47:26] demon_dandy: It looks nice though i dont really like how ichigo looks
[2:47:29] Private_Shorty: Have you seen any of the alt/modern fits that Kubo draws for the characters? They're so fucking good
[2:47:29] The_Great_Moof: Kubo reads a ton of fashion magazines so his characters are always fashionable
[2:47:30] JTBun: youre talking about big boobs

[2:55:56] リードジャイロツェッペリン: IDK MAN
[2:55:56] Private_Shorty: YES
[2:55:56] Senoquese: it should have been entirely 3d
[2:55:57] InsaneLoke: its the transitions
[2:55:58] Private_Shorty: EXACTLY
[2:56:07] cobatts: yeah the dancing is good, but they can't comp for shit
[2:56:07] InsaneLoke: if it was all 3d it wouldve been good
[2:56:07] EmkaZRC: I can agree with that
[2:56:11] motionstahp: The 2D in that scene people posted also was really standout
[2:56:12] demon_dandy: It looked amazing when it was popping off
[2:56:17] Senoquese: they should have done a girls band cry and made it all 3d
[2:56:18] EmkaZRC: It's the blend of the two
[2:56:31] fctseventyseven: Girls Band Cry is the best looking 3d anime yet imo
[2:56:41] InsaneLoke: amazing 3d with bad 2d is such a funny reversal
[2:56:50] F1nalStarman: o7

[2:57:14] demon_dandy: Chainsaw man some of those cuts are insane
[2:57:18] outrunthewind: yes
[2:57:18] eb0ss1: GBC OVER HNK? OVER BEASTARS??? OVER TRIGYN STANPEDE?????
[2:57:21] saigyo1: Etotama had incredible 3D segments. seamless with the 2D
[2:57:22] DavidPortnov: I like Studio Orange's 3D.
[2:57:27] timinator193: But Dragon Ball Z the one on my mind alot ashton51Love
[2:57:29] リードジャイロツェッペリン: i think we have seen better 3d before i think i saw a live action side to side with people recreating the scenes and some of the dance moves just looked out right goofy
[2:57:30] thomas2uentin: anime Steven Universe
[2:57:30] ImChileanNow: best 3D for me is still Etotama
[2:57:33] InsaneLoke: i loved the new trigun animation
[2:57:33] DerSeelander: I feel like there will be a point where they master 2D + 3D, they're getting better and better
[2:57:35] Potatoidea: GameBoy Color
[2:57:42] Senoquese: no ashton the precure eds dont count as a 3d anime

[2:57:44] リードジャイロツェッペリン: so that might be why its so memeable
[2:57:44] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[2:57:45] Senoquese: I KNEWWWWWW IT
[2:57:47] JaAmfan: also true
[2:57:50] InsaneLoke: though once we bring in movies, its hard to beat the Lupin movie
[2:57:52] fctseventyseven: HNK is way better in the manga though
[2:57:57] EmkaZRC: It's Houseki No Kuni no contest
[2:58:04] saigyo1: @ImChileanNow you're a knower!
[2:58:05] JTBun: LMAOOOOO

[2:59:53] The_Great_Moof: RWBY... ugh. i stuck with it for so long. so much wasted time.
[2:59:55] theSimplechild: Waterboarding in Guantanamo Bay sounds pretty rad if you don't know what either of those things are

[3:00:32] dax812: @InsaneLoke Like the fights are fine but they'll go on for like 3x longer than any fight should and it just takes forever
[3:00:33] ImChileanNow: Inuyashiki was also great but it's more raw
[3:00:36] ajvark: wait is this your 3 by 3 ashton or is it someone else's
[3:00:36] DavidPortnov: Bold take. I actually also loved the Inuyashiki manga.

[4:01:13] ImChileanNow: depends
[4:01:13] DavidPortnov: I think that was 5.
[4:01:16] Jasuchin: Persona 4 GOLDEN anime was ass
[4:01:16] cobatts: it's fine?? wild to be here though
[4:01:19] JTBun: P5 is FUCKING HORRIBLE
[4:01:22] JaAmfan: both were bad
[4:01:24] Jasuchin: Persona 4 ORIGINAL anime was awesome
[4:01:24] demon_dandy: Its probably the best persona anime that isnt a movie
[4:01:24] res_ipsa_: The Persona 4 Golden anime is bad. P4A (the original) is pretty good
[4:01:28] Private_Shorty: Golden bad, and P5 also ass
[4:01:38] theSimplechild: P4A is great, and the dub is greater.
[4:01:42] Potatoidea: LOL
[4:01:43] RockLobster52: p4 golden was kind of funny though because it was done through the lens of him being on a ng+ run
[4:01:53] Jasuchin: P4A actually ADDED to Persona 4's quality
[4:01:53] EmkaZRC: Oh so Golden is the P4 one that was ass
[4:01:54] buruhas: danganronpa 3 anime is awesome because it's so bad
[4:01:58] DuelViper_: I disagree the danganrompa 3 was really good
[4:02:01] deafmutelaughing: danganronpa 3 defender
[4:02:02] DavidPortnov: @RockLobster52 That's an interesting sell.
[4:02:05] demon_dandy: LMAO
[4:02:09] Superfroakie82: actually only the first season on danganronpa is adaptation
[4:02:17] aureliangates: ok no danganronpa v3 anime is actually unbelivably funny i think the whole cuck subplot really adds to it
[4:02:29] deafmutelaughing: I think it sucks but so does all of danganronpa
[4:02:32] MelvinSoupreme: LOL
[4:02:33] RockLobster52: yeah golden when it covers what happens in the original is good, but it skips around to cover mostly the new stuff
[4:02:40] motionstahp: Danganronpa 3 was horrible but the Juzo memes when it was airing was very funny
[4:02:44] The_Great_Moof: chat really sharing today, huh
[4:02:46] RockLobster52: so if you just watch that without knowing what happens in p4, it's bad
[4:02:51] aureliangates: thats not why i like it................
[4:03:03] DerSeelander: Call me trashy or basic but I enjoyed the Danganronpa anime
[4:03:09] demon_dandy: Scott pilgrim is also crazy ICANT i respect it but its crazy
[4:03:11] Romblymo: Fist of the North star can still be watched today

[4:04:03] Potatoidea: She used the fist on him
[4:04:06] The_Great_Moof: millenials are getting sensitive about their ages lol

[4:05:02] DuelViper_: Cyberpunk ending PISSED ME OFF
[4:05:02] DavidPortnov: Cyberpunk is easily my favorite Trigger show, but I also just love the game/world too.
[4:05:03] Private_Shorty: Real
[4:05:03] demon_dandy: They nail the humor and sol of the game tbh, its just the battles cant really translate
[4:05:04] Senoquese: LOL
[4:05:04] buruhas: did you get to the episode when David installs the kebab machine
[4:05:25] DavidPortnov: @buruhas Oh yeah, that was awesome!

[4:07:06] The_Great_Moof: HS of the D, i was in a weird headspace and shotgunned that show twice in a single weekend.
[4:07:10] Bubsla: Highschool of the dead has boobs, it's a bit egregious.
[4:07:10] thomas2uentin: Was it?
[4:07:16] EmkaZRC: It's fun
[4:07:22] chasingperspective11: Honestly same for me
[4:07:25] ThatAdde: met you at a really autistic time in your life
[4:07:27] res_ipsa_: @xicervt I'm kind of an AoT hater, and this is my list lmao

[4:07:54] cobatts: no, aot is garbage
[4:07:56] xicervt: @res_ipsa_ ohhh i just dont like how they milk the show and that ending
[4:07:57] The_Great_Moof: AoT S4 fell off a cliff
[4:07:58] redactedenheim: nah I never got into AOT
[4:08:05] DavidPortnov: It's a love-hate.
[4:08:12] demon_dandy: AoT s2 was my favourite part ashton51Baby
[4:08:15] Kitkattack: Aot was never that cool imo
[4:08:18] Bubsla: I hate aot and mha
[4:08:27] res_ipsa_: yeah, that first season really captured me like nothing else back in the day
[4:08:32] chasingperspective11: Hmmm interesting
[4:08:32] Private_Shorty: Librarian, pull up the clip
[4:09:03] Romblymo: AOT was one of the anime that penetrated the normie sphere
[4:09:05] DavidPortnov: Absolutely.

[4:10:09] ArthurWar: BD has an excellent OST because of it, it's crazy good
[4:10:09] xicervt: aot animation is good but the story and that ending kills me
[4:10:12] Romblymo: the gates are open
[4:10:12] JTBun: ive heard nothing but great things about bravely default
[4:10:13] RockLobster52: nope
[4:10:16] DuelViper_: Once you find out this is a isolated island all the impact of attack on titan. Goes AWAY
[4:10:16] Romblymo: nope
[4:10:17] EmkaZRC: No
[4:10:22] RockLobster52: she might be taking care of stuff
[4:10:26] Kitkattack: yeah isn't that nuts that Beribug was just here earlier
[4:10:28] outrunthewind: Not THIS time

[4:11:11] deafmutelaughing: I don't think I've ever heard anyone praise it specifically apart from the vn
[4:11:14] The_Great_Moof: lol
[4:11:19] Kitkattack: "this far in" she says barely into the double digits
[4:11:22] TheDocperian: I swear we had 1 LS
[4:11:30] chasingperspective11: All from that same era
[4:11:33] dax812: Bro is a slice of life enjoyer
[4:11:36] Bubsla: Especially a anime adaptation of a vn game. At that point, it's just the same as the game.
[4:11:49] xicervt: k-on was so good
[4:12:05] ImChileanNow: Panty Stocking is slice of life for Chicago people
[4:12:07] eb0ss1: tech I had k-on
[4:12:08] EmkaZRC: These girls do be doing cute things
[4:12:14] dax812: I don't think i understand what a slice of life is ashton51Bocchi
[4:12:16] xicervt: lucky star was my 4ft anime i ever watch
[4:12:17] Jasuchin: Damn, know what I could've put on my list that I only just remembered? Science Ninja Team Gatchaman!
[4:12:17] ArthurWar: That is exactly what this is lmao
[4:12:24] The_Great_Moof: guy likes moe
[4:12:29] chasingperspective11: Lololol
[4:12:29] Bubsla: Slice of life is like, daily life
[4:12:29] Kitkattack: @ImChileanNow ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[4:12:40] DerSeelander: Lucky Star is super overrated
[4:12:46] aureliangates: ur crazy
[4:12:52] dax812: Lucky Star was my 2nd anime I didn't get ANY of the jokes
[4:12:54] Jasuchin: I need to play Seins Gate
[4:13:04] Kitkattack: PSG2 had some good episodes but didn't work all to great
[4:13:07] xicervt: k-on is amazing i love the one ending song

[4:13:26] TheDocperian: @Jasuchin It's peak
[4:13:36] DerSeelander: No no, Kyoani is great, I just think it's kinda a boring show
[4:13:36] DavidPortnov: @TheDocperian It sure is.
[4:13:39] ReyJaggy: oldge goose
[4:13:40] Jasuchin: @TheDocperian I have it on Steam, I just need to make the time
[4:13:40] ImChileanNow: dude PSG2 is what it was meant to be, if people got disappointed it's their own fault to hype itself inside their heads
[4:13:40] outrunthewind: Some people are just way way too pretentious
[4:13:41] dax812: Konata for sure would've been a vtuber
[4:13:49] EmkaZRC: I hated Lucky Star and K-on back then. Maybe I'd have a different opinion if I watched them now
[4:13:53] ArthurWar: I think Ace Attorney might be the newest thing on here I've watched, and it was mostly because one episode is based on a train mystery that was not an adaptation
[4:13:59] 0oGooseo0: Have I hit unc status in the pitcrew??
[4:14:02] Jasuchin: Nichijou is so good
[4:14:06] DavidPortnov: @EmkaZRC I'm in the same camp.
[4:14:07] DerSeelander: K-On was great
[4:14:19] Bubsla: You're a unc

[4:15:29] EmkaZRC: Shirobako is great
[4:15:30] ImChileanNow: it's still decent
[4:15:35] fctseventyseven: Sakura Quest was ok, should've been more gay
[4:15:35] The_Great_Moof: Sakura Quest was okay. i loved Shirobako tho.
[4:15:42] ImChileanNow: WHAT
[4:15:43] Kitkattack: Gurren lagann is so peak man
[4:15:44] xicervt: Bako was ok
[4:15:44] deafmutelaughing: I didn't get far through shirobako, I loved the vibes but it felt too mundane
[4:15:44] Superfroakie82: sakura quest was a lot of absolutely nothing
[4:15:44] F1nalStarman: Shirobako and Ghost in the Shell!!!
[4:15:52] ImChileanNow: I'll buy the mouse trap
[4:15:53] The_Great_Moof: i think its mid
[4:16:07] DavidPortnov: GitS 1995 is actually in my Top 4 favorite movies period.
[4:16:10] redactedenheim: Idon't remember Shirobako. I watched it, I just don't remember it
[4:16:10] cobatts: sakura quest is one of the few p.a. works I didn't watch

[4:16:42] Kitkattack: Sol has great taste
[4:16:56] dax812: I couldn't understand Dragon Maid I kept trying to enjoy it
[4:16:58] beat_shobon: i like the office lady dragon
[4:17:01] The_Great_Moof: it is!
[4:17:11] ImChileanNow: bro if they get filtered by Maid Dragon they are in the wrong hobby
[4:17:13] killerscorp942: Maid dragon ops are so good
[4:17:15] xicervt: Maid Dragon is awesome also Oppai Loli is nothing wrong
[4:17:22] Kitkattack: I don't vibe with slice of life honestly
[4:17:23] borg_to_the_third: Fafnir
[4:17:23] insomniyawn: it is really good yuri with side charas that just dont appeal to me personally so i always go back and forth on it
[4:17:24] redactedenheim: see now Dragon Maid is too fluffy for me, I dropped it
[4:17:24] lexycon94: I think dragon maid is fine but for some reason I just can't see it as a yuri lmao
[4:17:26] Bubsla: Yeah, it's got some criticism. Not as egregious as some of the other stuff though I think.
[4:17:35] EmkaZRC: I knew I probably wouldn't like Dragon Maid so I never bothered
[4:17:36] The_Great_Moof: Kobayashi x Tohru is actual iyashikei vibes

[4:24:17] The_Great_Moof: Vandread, yead, 100% into a silly harem anime
[4:24:19] Kitkattack: bros who stan Gurren lagann are already real ones
[4:24:23] Bubsla: Black clover is also pretty generic
[4:24:27] Mace492: Black Clover is peak
[4:24:32] PockChicken: i couldnt get past the screaming at the start of black clover
[4:24:35] demon_dandy: The most random of people turn to black clover
[4:24:36] chasingperspective11: @dax812 Lol
[4:24:36] Private_Shorty: Black Clover has some insanely hype moments ngl
[4:24:37] Navy_Mongoose: @Kitkattack ashton51Nodders
[4:24:48] xicervt: black clover was really meh for me
[4:24:52] DavidPortnov: I've always thought of Gurren Lagann as an anime everyone has seen and loves.
[4:24:55] vtuberacingcorp: Oh I love that restaurant anime.
[4:24:56] RockLobster52: I think I will put Vandread on my to-watch list, this looks good
[4:24:57] InsaneLoke: black clover is my most hated animanga of all time. ive tried like a dozen times to try and give it a chance and ive dropped it every time, i just cant get through it
[4:24:57] vtuberacingcorp: It's so cute
[4:24:59] chasingperspective11: Vandread I think was 2000
[4:25:02] PockChicken: Railgun is better than Index, fight me
[4:25:10] demon_dandy: quintuplets bringin back the feeling Classic
[4:25:19] Gloryflare: why no black clover?
[4:25:24] cobatts: thats just truth
[4:25:26] redactedenheim: @PockChicken valid but index is also good
[4:25:28] ThatAdde: Anime? 100%
[4:25:29] Private_Shorty: Tbh Black Clover is like if Bleach had better animation but only like 50% of the time (thousand year blood war is good but I haven't seen any of it yet)
[4:25:31] InsaneLoke: i feel like thats the general consensus, that railgun is the better
[4:25:37] Superfroakie82: ok i sent in something
[4:25:38] dax812: "It's gonna get good after 200 episodes I swear"
[4:25:39] outrunthewind: I watched like 2 episodes of Black Clover and dropped it
[4:25:44] Bubsla: Another way too long shounen anime
[4:25:45] 0oGooseo0: I'm making my friends watch gurren lagann rn lol, we do it when we hang out
[4:25:55] dax812: Been watching anime since 9th grade they watched one anime each year
[4:26:11] Private_Shorty: There's a curve for black clover, the first 40 episodes are kinda ass, it gets good for a while, it peaks, then it goes back to being ass
[4:26:11] Potatoidea: Not shown: 10 viewings of One Piece
[4:26:13] demon_dandy: Tenchi muyo is kinda awesome tbh thats a really cool pick
[4:26:14] The_Great_Moof: ouch
[4:26:14] Mace492: Black Clover takes like 20+ episodes to get good but thats a big ask for most people
[4:26:15] xicervt: young one comeback when you got a list of 2k+ anime
[4:26:24] xicervt: that you watch
[4:26:37] PockChicken: need more boomers in chat
[4:26:42] xicervt: ...
[4:26:44] vtuberacingcorp: I haven't seen much of the anime, but I think Black Clover is actually a pretty good manga. I quite enjoyed it.
[4:26:46] outrunthewind: @Private_Shorty If you have to watch 40 episodes of ass to get good, you have an ass-show
[4:26:48] zer0hazard: black clover is an acquired taste. that being said, acquiring the taste isn't worth the effort
[4:26:50] InsaneLoke: black clover just has the worst pacing ever
[4:26:51] xicervt: is 32 old enough
[4:26:55] Bubsla: Slow ass anime
[4:26:55] InsaneLoke: i couldnt stand it
[4:26:56] The_Great_Moof: @outrunthewind ITS TRUUUUE
[4:26:58] Private_Shorty: @outrunthewind Yup, never said it was a good show lol
[4:27:03] DavidPortnov: Yes, for sure.
[4:27:06] keternal: when i went to see heavens feel at its premiere they played a black clover trailer and everyone was like BOOO and the people MCing the premiere were like wow ok y'all do Not like that huh
[4:27:12] Bubsla: It's very formulaic
[4:27:14] Private_Shorty: But it has good moments that take way too much time to get to
[4:27:16] PockChicken: +30 is boomer here
[4:27:17] Kitkattack: true, nothing that ground breaking so far
[4:27:19] DavidPortnov: But it is what is and I don't mind watching it knowing that.
[4:27:21] InsaneLoke: the gachiakuta anime is SOOOO shonen, and i didnt get that vibe as much from the manga
[4:27:21] Superfroakie82: theres definitely media where this isnt true
[4:27:25] keternal: i have no opinion myself on black clover, that's the extent of my exposure to it LOL
[4:27:26] xicervt: @PockChicken .....
[4:27:39] PockChicken: 39
[4:27:43] ImChileanNow: watch the first 80 episodes!
[4:27:49] Private_Shorty: It's a hard sell for *3* episodes
[4:27:53] redactedenheim: Haruhi endless 8 was hard to get through even
[4:27:55] Bubsla: I already watched a several 100+ shounen anime, I don't need to see another.
[4:27:56] TheDocperian: I found I resonated with more of the characters in Gachiakuta than any other shonen
[4:28:04] Romblymo: GASP
[4:28:09] JaAmfan: bold
[4:28:11] theSimplechild: ruined forever

[4:28:25] bonatide: Youre so brave and so wrong about fairytale
[4:28:27] RockLobster52: sorry, I can't say I do outside of the arc where they go to the parallel world with magic items
[4:28:30] outrunthewind: Like, I can appreciate a slow burn where the BEST part of a show are later on. Steins;Gate is that way. But slow build up is not the same as shit build up

[4:44:28] cobatts: koyukai no kanata
[4:44:35] dax812: The bigger you get the more they want their content to appeal to everyone so it loses all focus
[4:44:39] chasingperspective11: Very true
[4:44:48] The_Great_Moof: Kyoukai no Kanata. KyoAni's edgelord moeblob.

[4:46:29] demon_dandy: The ova for it before the anime
[4:46:31] StarBurst_Stream: WAIT IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW ninoegWHATTHE
[4:46:37] vtuberacingcorp: People can feel weird about chobits and also know that that's the whole point.
[4:46:37] outrunthewind: I have Ore Monogatari for my large guy/small girl without making it weird
[4:46:43] cobatts: billiards was the prequel as an animator training project
[4:46:46] Kitkattack: Chobits is a heartbreaker
[4:47:00] TheAsterite: Couldn't he just dremel the power button down
[4:47:03] PockChicken: CHI is CUTE
[4:47:08] beat_shobon: I'm sure Chobits changed some wires in my brain when I first watched it, it's such a good show
[4:47:08] ImChileanNow: I think it's a shame most of your audience is male bc we haven't seen any venomous yaoi yet like Togainu no Chi, DMMD or Love Stage
[4:47:09] killerscorp942: I've rewatched it like 5 times so I'd say it's good
[4:47:13] EmkaZRC: Speak your truth!
[4:47:19] shindigs: the opening song is so overrated, prob the most annoying point
[4:47:20] TheAsterite: ashton51Squeeze
[4:47:29] DavidPortnov: That wasn't my beef with Chobits. I actually don't remember what it was. I just remember feeling that Chobits was a waste of my time when I finished it.
[4:47:31] PockChicken: wwwwhhattt
[4:47:34] PockChicken: ban that person lol
[4:47:35] RockLobster52: I think I 've got one toxic yaoi pick in mine
[4:47:38] shindigs: i failed at rage baiting
[4:47:38] MelvinSoupreme: chobits is uh groovin magic?
[4:47:42] Kitkattack: Shindigs you have to sitdown
[4:47:45] vtuberacingcorp: I dunno, I read the first volume at like 12, I don't remember much of it, but I knew that was the point.
[4:47:51] PockChicken: i rage lol
[4:47:55] xicervt: i mean there where other holes to use i dont why they dont Chobits is a bait
[4:47:57] beat_shobon: I can't be ragebaited, I know the song is peak
[4:48:02] thomas2uentin: Least problematic thing clamp has done
[4:48:14] JaAmfan: @MelvinSoupreme thats diebuster

[4:48:40] demon_dandy: Chu chu chu chu yeah
[4:48:41] vtuberacingcorp: I guess it's just like, I think it's a fine topic, it is a little odd how young many of us read it.
[4:48:45] ImChileanNow: I'd go even further and say the problematic label is dum. Just follow CERO rating and you're good
[4:48:52] EmkaZRC: I first watched Chobits as a kid and I didn't knew it was the point but I just didn't care lol
[4:49:09] RockLobster52: my exposure to chobits was like when I was 13 or 14
[4:49:16] Kitkattack: while there is lewd stuff in chobits it's mostly about like true love and cutesy junk
[4:49:20] spikebomb5: biggest trash i read was kissxsis and to love ru darkness
[4:49:34] vtuberacingcorp: I want to be clear, I was not uncomfortable at the time.
[4:49:39] RockLobster52: yeah it's all about saving yourself for someone you actually love
[4:49:40] vtuberacingcorp: I think it's a little weird looking back.
[4:49:42] xicervt: Let me be with youuuuuu so good
[4:49:47] beat_shobon: A lot of Chobits goes beyond the awkward button moment, there's so much good things about the premise and a lot of sincere moments

[4:50:37] killerscorp942: I usually skip ops but that one I sit through for every ep so good
[4:50:45] beat_shobon: Also I feel the whole persocon setting really influenced early Vocaloid so it was quite the segue for teenager shobon lol
[4:50:52] StarBurst_Stream: Comm night in discord let's watch chobit
