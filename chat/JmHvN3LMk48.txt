[0:27:55] ScarletRook: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul the stunned silence
[0:28:21] raiifrost: My favourite part of stream is when Ashton finds out chatters have a life outside of her
[0:28:25] DatBoiVLC: Lmaooo
[0:28:27] Bubsla: @hamhaha83 good night
[0:28:32] yojamjam: no yeah she's 17 months it's a nightmare
[0:28:38] ScarletRook: toddlers find a way to get into everything
[0:28:59] RycegoZ: Toddlers are better than babies, they’ll listen to you if they think you’re smart or cool enough
[0:29:39] RycegoZ: That’s what grandparents are for, they help raise the kids. Takes a village to raise a family
[0:29:57] raiifrost: Always have little trinkets of trivia for the toddler, to appease the child
[0:30:04] rikkaonline: i have a 2.5 yo nephew and wew I would not choose that life lol
[0:30:33] RedCumIsJustBlood: It's a walking PSA
[0:30:36] mushi_buns: ashton51Omegalul
[0:30:57] PrettyPatrickLunchtime: Raising a girl has been a delight
[0:30:59] RycegoZ: People think raising a boy is more hands off
[0:31:04] raiifrost: I see posts recently about how this lady raised her son so good, but being exposed to forums turned him into an incel

[0:31:51] Bubsla: Boys are stoopid
[0:32:01] InsaneLoke: raising me was a nightmare for my parents cus i have autism LOL
[0:32:11] c_v_catullus16: No iPad kids?
[0:32:13] mushi_buns: It really depends on personality even at such a small age
[0:32:30] rikkaonline: at that age, the difference comes from parenting, not the actual gender of the child
[0:32:44] c_v_catullus16: Cocomelon is a sensory nightmare.
[0:32:44] newdlebomb: tv is ruining the yougins
[0:32:44] PrettyPatrickLunchtime: LUL I'm not surprised. Kids pick up on bad tendencies, even if the kids on the tv learn a lesson to not be rude, they resonate with just what they like
[0:32:47] raiifrost: Auchichum
[0:33:00] PrettyPatrickLunchtime: Thank god for Bluey

[0:38:45] Bubsla: Oh no
[0:38:52] RycegoZ: Huh
[0:38:58] raiifrost: :(((
[0:39:13] vectri: >(
[0:39:20] RycegoZ: Oh, you overate and stressed about it
[0:39:21] InsaneLoke: so about bandai
[0:39:28] Robert_Brown_: Did you get a N95 for the con?
[0:39:29] yojamjam: :)
[0:40:35] GrandAM64: I can kinda understand not wanting to bring it to the Western market, considering the current climate
[0:40:50] Bubsla: What climate?
[0:41:08] kevx59: Xenoglossia?
[0:41:27] zenkigo: alo !clap
[0:41:38] Robert_Brown_: @Bubsla People complaining on Twitter?
[0:41:55] T33bags: ewos
[0:41:58] keternal: lmao 60 dollar app
[0:42:03] kevx59: Oof
[0:42:07] Bubsla: Wow
[0:42:09] ScarletRook: But then they saw how big Love Live got with translating their apps so Idk what they're thinking
[0:42:11] justchiken: ashton51Omegalul
[0:42:35] Robert_Brown_: Did they not understand app-store pricing?
[0:42:37] raiifrost: We did a half assed dub job and overpriced the game, why would they NOT want this franchise at all
[0:42:38] Not_Kamille: ashton51Sip
[0:42:40] foncomics: as a long time fan of bandai titles, i have long felt like they intentionally sabotage their chances in their en market...
[0:42:48] Robert_Brown_: I guess it might have worked on Steam
[0:42:56] Toraccel_: Namco historically has a problem of announcing a cool thing, and then failing to market/properly price/properly manage it expecting it to just make money on the base of a popular ip and existing, and then shutting it down
[0:42:57] Bubsla: I think I remember that
[0:43:02] justcerebro: good thing they stopped wasting their resources on mid that early ashton51Smile
[0:43:03] Robert_Brown_: Yeah that was crazy
[0:43:51] Not_Kamille: Wait is the Switch version of P3P badly translated too?
[0:44:08] ScarletRook: Yeah P4 was the golden child
[0:44:17] keternal: the only reason i hate atlus is that there hasn't been a new trauma center in an eon
[0:44:18] Not_Kamille: ashton51Cry ashton51Cry ashton51Cry ashton51Cry ashton51Cry
[0:44:18] TheAsterite: as an etrian odyssey fan, i loved atlus
[0:44:24] TheAsterite: imaHeck imaHeck imaHeck
[0:44:38] vectri: Ettian odyssey has great translations, which is ee
[0:44:40] rikkaonline: so many japanese companies care so little about the world outside japan, they dont even want our money
[0:44:43] TheAsterite: now there's no more etrian odyssey
[0:44:46] vectri: Which is weird*
[0:44:58] keternal: EO was great too i think PQ3 isn't an unrealistic thing to hope for
[0:45:08] foncomics: etrian is sooo good 10/10
[0:45:15] RycegoZ: Atlus made Gwimbly, how could you hate them
[0:45:23] keternal: persona Q
[0:45:28] Bubsla: Just big company bureaucracy
[0:45:50] TheAsterite: do you like dungeon crawlers?
[0:45:56] TheAsterite: etrian odyssey is pretty hard
[0:45:59] Toraccel_: to add to my point Gundam Evolution is a good example, along with multimedia based projects like ShiftyLook
[0:46:22] ScarletRook: mystery dungeon is considered one lol
[0:46:23] keternal: PQ is really fun, it's just EO with a persona skin but that's nice if you're even a casual persona fan
[0:46:33] Bubsla: All the mystery dungeons are good
[0:46:38] T33bags: did you download the psp emulator
[0:46:42] TheAsterite: the original mystery dungeon is on snes iirc
[0:46:43] vectri: Blue has really good music
[0:46:45] InsaneLoke: omg pokemoin rangers
[0:46:50] TheAsterite: dot was playing it last month
[0:46:55] foncomics: I MISS POKEMON RANGERS it was soooooo good
[0:46:59] metaconstruct: hope u had a good lunch ashton51Clap
[0:47:08] mushi_buns: ohh mystery dungeon is so fun!!!! One of my fav games ever
[0:47:15] metaconstruct: ashton51Baby
[0:47:16] Bubsla: Mystery dungeon is a whole series with a bunch of spin offs
[0:47:21] justcerebro: the original mystery dungeon is a dragon quest 4 spinoff
[0:47:21] Toraccel_: the original game with the mystery dungeon format was a dragon quest spinoff where you play as a shopkeeper i think
[0:47:33] InsaneLoke: my friend in elementary lended me their rangers copy and i was obsessed with it
[0:47:40] nacko_yo: nacko_yo subscribed with Prime. 
[0:47:42] Bubsla: There's also a chocobo mystery dungeon
[0:47:58] RycegoZ: It’s like final fantasy, just all connected
[0:48:02] nacko_yo: ashton51Love
[0:48:04] justcerebro: you can't just say all toriyama designs look the same ashton
[0:48:29] mushi_buns: the Explores of sky/darkness games are really good aswell, they made me cry so hard
[0:48:34] TheAsterite: Shiren the Wanderer is like the original character mystery dungeon after the dragonquest original
[0:48:39] justcerebro: yeah and all FF has chocobos you silly
[0:48:42] Toraccel_: love the smiles, my beloved sillies
[0:48:46] Toraccel_: *slimes
[0:49:11] RycegoZ: We’ll get mad either way
[0:49:20] ScarletRook: ashton...
[0:49:32] justcerebro: lmao
[0:49:47] boog6297: Moshi moshi boog desu wa
[0:49:49] keternal: someone made a fan remake of dq1 that i'm excited to check out sometime
[0:49:59] keternal: it looks like they added a lot of neat stuff to it
[0:50:02] Toraccel_: 3 or 11
[0:50:04] RycegoZ: Chrono Trigger, have to play that
[0:50:11] justcerebro: I think people usually recommend 3 or 11
[0:50:15] Bubsla: Yes
[0:50:20] Toraccel_: theyre working on one now i think
[0:50:23] keternal: dq6 is REALLY good
[0:50:27] TheAsterite: dragon quest is huge in japan
[0:50:28] mushi_buns: dragon quest is HUGE in japan yes
[0:50:37] mushi_buns: oh lmao
[0:50:54] RycegoZ: He did Chrono Trigger before Dragon Quest
[0:50:58] justcerebro: chrono trigger was square and dragon quest was enix (before they merged)
[0:51:14] raiifrost: Did you play the NDS PMD games
[0:51:26] Bubsla: The snes version has a different translation, some people like it better
[0:51:31] Robert_Brown_: Toriyama did the character design I think
[0:51:31] keternal: i think even dragon ball is continuing without toriyama so dq absolutely can
[0:51:40] Robert_Brown_: Did he write the story?
[0:51:41] T33bags: the art style and characters are there already it still goes with out him
[0:51:48] Toraccel_: the DS remake has some extra content
[0:51:49] InsaneLoke: peas meaty
[0:51:53] RycegoZ: Nintendo Dual Screen Pokémon Mystery Dungeon
