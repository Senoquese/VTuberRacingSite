[1:14:12] MikeFiro: HypeGhost HypeGhost HypeGhost
[1:14:45] Playmer: It's very situational to be fair
[1:14:47] rikkaonline: ive been on the other side of a bad interview too. it take a few tries to find the place that clicks and appreciates your skillset
[1:15:00] Playmer: Getting some handholding doesn't _automatically_ mean you bombed it.
[1:15:02] MikeFiro: h-handholding?!? HypeGhost HypeGhost HypeGhost
[1:15:08] kyle__senpai: Just got notice at my job today, not looking forward to interviewing again

[1:15:56] Senoquese: asked ppl to find me a job and they put me at the pitcrew... should have stayed a neet
[1:16:00] vectri: Interviewers usually start helping you if you flub the interview and will tell you what to review for future interviews

[1:16:15] kyle__senpai: @vectri this tbh
[1:16:29] rikkaonline: i agree, sometimes getting help is ok, if they can see your thought process is good but you got stuck on something
[1:16:31] TheAnglerCh: programmers are guaranteed to get a job if they wear their special thigh high socks to their interviews
[1:16:34] Playmer: I mostly hear about interviewers _not_ giving that fedback.
[1:17:09] MikeFiro: if i do get feedback i was declined :(
[1:17:16] RobotFaker: I am always worrying about if I'm adquete enough for my software job even though I keep getting good notes because of all the tech layoff news going on.....
