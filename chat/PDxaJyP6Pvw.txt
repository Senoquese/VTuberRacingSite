[1:14:10] rikkaonline: i started helping him through solving it. it was bad because he wasnt completely useless, just not doing great
[1:14:11] Playmer: Usually they'll lead you through the answer/give you hints/that sort of thing
[1:14:12] MikeFiro: HypeGhost HypeGhost HypeGhost
[1:14:45] Playmer: It's very situational to be fair
[1:14:47] rikkaonline: ive been on the other side of a bad interview too. it take a few tries to find the place that clicks and appreciates your skillset
