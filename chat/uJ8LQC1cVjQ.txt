[24:48:47] CoolinMcGroovin: probably a VR mod yeah
[24:48:48] phatscout: well not officially
[24:49:09] Senoquese: phasmophobia?
[24:49:23] phatscout: there are a few VR mods that are genuinely native lever quality
[24:49:28] CoolinMcGroovin: for real look into Cosmodread it's pretty good and it runs well because the graphics aren't crazy
[24:49:31] phatscout: native LEVEL quality
[24:49:44] Senoquese: idk about the cave one since its all immersion and not actual scary stuff
[24:50:02] JTBun: what about soma?
[24:50:07] timinator193: That is scray
[24:50:09] Senoquese: you can do that in a vrchat world
[24:50:25] kryvexi: soma is more existentially scary but it does have a lot of actual horror yeah
[24:50:28] demon_dandy: isnt soma more story? Unless the vr boosts it
[24:50:30] F1nalStarman: Not the Nutty Putty cave!
[24:50:47] timinator193: A furry specfically?
[24:50:51] CoolinMcGroovin: Soma is pretty story based but definitely has really good horror bits
[24:50:52] Senoquese: aw

[24:52:12] CoolinMcGroovin: all ass
[24:52:12] pogotross: I can get any combination of the migrane headache, the occular migrane, and partial body numbness
[24:52:24] Senoquese: if you feel it through it advil its probably a reallyyyy strong headache, not that its not helping ashton51Tehe
[24:52:26] timinator193: Maybe use ephedrine instead of advil
[24:52:31] 십간: and onions
[24:52:38] bonatide: Another garlic would set you right
[24:52:41] 십간: girl dinner
[24:52:44] timinator193: excedrine*
[24:52:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: she ate vegetables once and it fucking murdered her brain
[24:52:58] TheAsterite: could be more screen eye strain than migraine ashton51Thinky
[24:53:20] bonatide: Necklet wwparaKuhuhu wwparaKuhuhu wwparaKuhuhu
[24:53:25] Senoquese: headpats machine off?
[24:53:30] CoolinMcGroovin: actually, Nemimi has this stuff she uses for headaches that works instantly that she convinced someone else to use, you should ask her
[24:53:33] 십간: I'm stuffed from this turkey sandwich
[24:53:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe

[24:54:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: mY chilla you NEED TO EAT A REAL MEAL
[24:54:34] deafmutelaughing: I think it's going to have an incredibly bleak ending
[24:54:35] CoolinMcGroovin: I think in the next episode Pomni will trip and her shoes will come off and her feet will be revealed and
[24:54:44] demon_dandy: ICANT
[24:54:48] Senoquese: i think everyones like actually dead irl and this is like digital heaven and idk im not watching it
[24:55:01] CoolinMcGroovin: damn....
[24:55:10] shyguy336theppg: i found a show on YouTube called Bunny maloney
[24:55:10] demon_dandy: sighhh theres always vrchat pomni
[24:55:19] BIGHAM_vt: :00
[24:55:20] CoolinMcGroovin: the new current theory is that they're uploaded personalities like in Soma actually
[24:55:22] Senoquese: LOL
[24:55:42] deafmutelaughing: I dunno if that's a theory as much as what the show explicitly says
[24:55:51] F1nalStarman: Goose is messing with the fan theories so much ashton51Omegalul
[24:56:22] demon_dandy: @shyguy336theppg wait what grade are you in brother
[24:56:40] Romblymo: its gonna end up they're all just programs or something and its all pointless and grim or something
[24:56:45] timinator193: Surely they just tease the idea until the end of the show lol
[24:56:46] CoolinMcGroovin: unironically yeah it might be worth it
[24:57:00] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[24:57:01] TheAsterite: do you think jax is supposed to be just a less asshole nimdok?
[24:57:05] CoolinMcGroovin: you did all the updates for this phone right?
[24:57:07] StreamElements: Welcome to my Winter Break Donothon, pit crew!!! I'm streaming every day until January 4th to raise money for my upcoming projects in 2026. Wanna help me out? Let it snow here: https://streamelements.com/ashtonmarten/tip ❄
[24:57:09] Senoquese: wasnt your previous phone also disconnecting tho
[24:57:28] deafmutelaughing: I do not get ANY of the IHNMAIMS comparisons other than "they're trapped by computer"
[24:57:29] demon_dandy: nimdok deez nuts or somethin
[24:57:32] Superfroakie82: yeah i think it’d be funny if they were never humans at all they were always programs
[24:57:33] TheAsterite: from "i have no mouth and i must scream"
[24:57:44] CoolinMcGroovin: aint Nimdok that green dude from Gorillaz?
[24:57:47] deafmutelaughing: I know there's a youtube video about it but I refuse to watch it
[24:57:58] kryvexi: honestly i thought ep7 was gonna end with i have no mouth
[24:58:05] F1nalStarman: @deafmutelaughing Same.
[24:58:11] spikebomb5: in the game theres multiple endings
[24:58:12] Romblymo: you should play the vn
[24:58:17] F1nalStarman: @CoolinMcGroovin +2
[24:58:21] Senoquese: i think jax and pomni are gonna kiss
[24:58:24] demon_dandy: They are the last humans tortured endlessly and immortally by a super duper ultra computer
[24:58:37] TheAsterite: i mean, it's not exactly the same but there's some parallels
[24:58:40] demon_dandy: Its an amazing point and click game too
[24:58:42] 십간: pomni marten
[24:58:46] BIGHAM_vt: I don’t foresee any shipping either LOL
[24:58:51] bonatide: I think pomni is gonna kiss me...
[24:58:53] TheAsterite: nah
[24:58:57] deafmutelaughing: @bonatide True
[24:59:04] CoolinMcGroovin: @bonatide I respect that
[24:59:05] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[24:59:06] whosever0: jax and kinger canon
[24:59:06] TheAsterite: the ai is much more malevolent in ihnm
[24:59:07] BIGHAM_vt: bonatide vtubermShy
[24:59:08] 십간: I haven't watched much of the digital circus after the first ep
[24:59:18] demon_dandy: Theres a short story but the game expands on a lot of stuff
[24:59:35] Romblymo: I listened to the radio drama of it, I listen to the AM speech every now and then
[24:59:36] CoolinMcGroovin: honestly episode 3 is what hooks you on the show unironically
[24:59:36] Superfroakie82: i thought all they said was it was inspired by it
[24:59:46] phatscout: It's not a direct 1 to 1 bite of "I have no mouth" but its riffing on it and Harlan Ellison and "new weird" shit in general
[24:59:48] demon_dandy: Its impressive that every episode is like 20 minutes
[24:59:49] GManx0: It seems like such a episodical show that is also railed by its story
[24:59:50] Senoquese: the last episode i watched was during the movie night and it was the really bad one and you were like "fuckk its usually better than this". i didnt believe you
[24:59:53] whosever0: filler with minor plot but its still a fun watch
[25:00:05] CoolinMcGroovin: but yeah I really need to experience I have no mouth and I must scream
[25:00:06] demon_dandy: Maybe 40?
[25:00:09] deafmutelaughing: harlan ellison has a perfect voice for the story
[25:00:16] spikebomb5: ashton....radio dramas were big back in the day
[25:00:26] F1nalStarman: The strong point of the writing is character development imo; the overarching plot is mostly in the background
[25:00:43] GManx0: You are so influenced by your environment
[25:00:48] phatscout: wait the zoomers like harlan ellison?
[25:00:50] demon_dandy: It gets pretty heavy tbf
[25:00:50] CoolinMcGroovin: I mean it's probably big on tik tok the same way Lain was and you know damn well no one played that game
[25:00:52] 십간: is it worst than booktok
[25:00:54] spikebomb5: it's fine, tiktokers only know AM and nothing else
[25:00:56] phatscout: that's crazy
[25:00:58] vermillion2002: @spikebomb5 Yeah War of the Worlds
[25:00:59] DavidPortnov: Yeah, I hear it's a game worth playing.
[25:01:04] Senoquese: LOL
[25:01:10] phatscout: Ashton have you played Control?
[25:01:14] deafmutelaughing: dumbass streamer responds to external stimuli 🫵 ICANT
[25:01:15] timinator193: You are a product of your environment
[25:01:19] Senoquese: doctor who started as a radio drama
[25:01:20] demon_dandy: @phatscout i think people are up in arms over knowing the game and not reading the short story
[25:01:27] GManx0: ashton51Tensai
[25:01:33] phatscout: Ashton have you played Control? it's another New Weird influenced thing you'd probably fw it
[25:02:02] 십간: ring fit Ashton ♥️
[25:02:06] Superfroakie82: what is New Weird
[25:02:07] StreamElements: Welcome to my Winter Break Donothon, pit crew!!! I'm streaming every day until January 4th to raise money for my upcoming projects in 2026. Wanna help me out? Let it snow here: https://streamelements.com/ashtonmarten/tip ❄
[25:02:11] GManx0: Put more feet pics in the goals
[25:02:18] JTBun: I love control, you do not need to play Alan Wake to play it
[25:02:30] vermillion2002: Wait alan wake is related to control?
[25:02:34] kryvexi: oh hey TMA mention
[25:02:34] CoolinMcGroovin: @GManx0 hey Ashton, I think you should look into this
[25:02:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: dramaCDs? DramaCDNUTS!
[25:02:40] kryvexi: LMAO fair
[25:02:42] bonatide: Retweet some wedding 2b to get the ball rolling
[25:02:42] phatscout: New Weird is like the type of stuff than Harlan Ellison writes
[25:02:43] Senoquese: @JTBun i never played control, you do not need to play alan wake
[25:02:44] spikebomb5: theres that one weekly radio drama about mysterious happenings in a small town
[25:02:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[25:03:10] phatscout: yeah you don't need to have played Alan Wake before playing Control
[25:03:11] vermillion2002: @Blaisevtch I legit would have never even guessed
[25:03:13] Senoquese: Life
[25:03:14] kryvexi: it's ok to just exist sometimes
[25:03:19] CoolinMcGroovin: that'd be pretty neat, like joining a Fall Guys lobby or something
[25:03:24] bonatide: Donate to continue her existence
[25:03:26] 십간: I'd like to find some of the jojo CD dramas
[25:03:26] timinator193: 8,069.69
[25:03:27] phatscout: but you probably should play AW1 before playing the control DLCs
[25:03:29] BIGHAM_vt: Ashton marten without her dentures
[25:03:32] F1nalStarman: Fall Guys! ashton51Baby
[25:03:36] JTBun: @vermillion2002 yes, but pretty dethatched other than 1 dlc. They are in the same universe
[25:03:43] redactedenheim: its  better than not existing
[25:03:47] Senoquese: omg fall guys pissed you off
[25:03:49] CoolinMcGroovin: oh I'm sure, it's a free game
[25:03:53] demon_dandy: LMAO seno
[25:03:55] ArthurWar: Some lobbies are designed for smaller groups I think
[25:03:56] timinator193: ig right?
[25:04:00] deafmutelaughing: I think it's still installed on my PS4
[25:04:02] Senoquese: i bought the chinchilla skin and everything to play fall guys with you and we played like 2 rounds and you hated it
[25:04:03] 십간: I'm a ball guy
[25:04:12] demon_dandy: It pissed you off ICANT
[25:04:13] CoolinMcGroovin: WAIT, what if we get together a full Fortnite lobby

[25:05:00] CoolinMcGroovin: please I have the twink Raiden skin
[25:05:02] Senoquese: @GManx0 miku is on the shop rn
[25:05:25] DavidPortnov: Community game day sounds like a good idea.

[25:05:30] bonatide: She didnt even play during Simpsons...
[25:05:30] demon_dandy: You dont even gotta play the br ig
[25:06:10] demon_dandy: It is tbf but incase you wanted to play with s lot of pitcrew at once ashton51Tehe
[25:06:10] CoolinMcGroovin: oh also, you should do a community Concord night
[25:06:23] F1nalStarman: ashton51Omegalul
[25:06:23] kryvexi: arc raiders is probably the most chill extraction shooter ive ever played. low bar though
[25:06:26] bonatide: She sounded so stereotypical it was funny
[25:06:35] JTBun: ark raiders has AI tho
[25:06:38] JTBun: so yuckly

[25:07:16] kryvexi: arc raiders uses ai text to speech   with consent from the VAs so it's closer to the vein of miku than generative "art" slop but i still dont like it
[25:07:31] 십간: beak
[25:07:38] Romblymo: could do some team pitcrew vs pitrcrew games or something
[25:07:46] phatscout: Arc Raiders is a shame because it's genuinely really dope but it has a bunch of al generated voices, yeah they paid the voices but it's still like.... idk man
[25:08:00] CoolinMcGroovin: @Romblymo oh my god wait L4D2 versus
[25:08:05] phatscout: They got an investment form Elevenlabs so that's why they went in on that stuff
[25:08:12] kryvexi: it doesnt help that the voice acting in arc raiders is definitely noticeably weird sounding too LMAO
[25:08:17] Senoquese: i dont like the "ai voices with consent" because whatever money they could get that one time is no money compared to what they could be getting for each individual job
[25:08:19] demon_dandy: @coolinmcgroovin wait ashton on the zombies would have funnn
[25:08:29] kryvexi: @Senoquese agreed
[25:08:30] CoolinMcGroovin: @demon_dandy yessss!
[25:08:32] phatscout: also speaking of Embark, The Finals is pretty rad if you can get past the also ai slop voices
[25:08:35] Romblymo: I think that does have spectator so you could watch is smash eachother
[25:08:50] CoolinMcGroovin: playing the zombies is always fun you get to climb and jump everywhere and troll people
[25:08:50] DerSeelander: Helldivers 2?
[25:08:52] demon_dandy: Zombie gameplay was always way more fun imo ashton51Blehhh
[25:08:59] DerSeelander: I saw you play with Bao a while ago
[25:09:11] Romblymo: tf2 could also be fun since its bigger lobbies
[25:09:28] CoolinMcGroovin: helldivers 2 is so fun actually
[25:09:31] timinator193: lol
[25:09:37] Red__2: that would be better yeah
[25:09:38] timinator193: helldivers 2 gameplay!
[25:09:39] CoolinMcGroovin: yeah more casual just goofy missions
[25:09:43] DerSeelander: Yeah there are trivial ones
[25:09:45] Senoquese: i was kinda hoping youd play with similar level vtubers so you could all learn at the same pace ashton51Tehe still really fun
[25:09:48] GehrmantheCannibal: it is very fun
[25:09:50] timinator193: It comes with experience
[25:09:53] phatscout: they fixed that now
[25:09:58] demon_dandy: That one guy who kept asking to join hd2 lobby the entire stream + the stream after can finally join ashtonPLEASE
[25:09:58] CoolinMcGroovin: yeah sadly just 4 so that's a big downside
[25:10:00] spikebomb5: theres a beta thats like 35 gigs now
[25:10:06] phatscout: they shank the install form like 150gigs to just 35 now
[25:10:08] timinator193: They made the game smaller recently
[25:10:13] DerSeelander: Based
[25:10:16] Senoquese: helldivers 2
[25:10:16] CoolinMcGroovin: Helldivers lol
