[0:55:01] demon_dandy: supras good for customizing if its anything like irl
[0:55:28] mczub: that's super weird that it's not showing up, it should be there after doing that 15 minute intro you already did
[0:55:36] HashiriyaR32: I can see the area where the marker would be...........but no marker
[0:55:52] HungryHonk: you don't have enough campaign progress
[0:55:57] HungryHonk: that's also why online is locked
[0:56:15] HungryHonk: complete the adventure stuff
[0:56:23] HungryHonk: the box that says adventure on the campaign menu
[0:56:27] hajijo: You gotta keep doing them and earning accolade points
[0:56:34] tetelande: Are you sure hungry? The internet says it should be only 15 minutes
[0:56:35] demon_dandy: reliable bronco ashton51Tensai
[0:56:47] HashiriyaR32: the user
[0:56:50] demon_dandy: hungryhonk
[0:57:04] anthechamp8932: do you own Hot Wheels DLC?
[0:57:25] kuroisnotsalty: Hot Wheels DLC!
[0:57:32] AlexRod01234: DLC
[0:57:40] spacechannel4: XD if only they would explain it better
[0:57:42] hajijo: Yeah, that's it! You go to where those are marked on the map and do the missions to unlock more of the game.
[0:57:46] HashiriyaR32: ....ok, this is odd, you already did an expedition, but the map marker for hot wheels DLC not showing?
[0:57:52] mczub: maybe double check the DLC is installed and the game's fully updated?
[0:58:05] hajijo: There's one you didn't do somewhere
[0:58:12] HashiriyaR32: .....wait hold on
[0:58:43] HashiriyaR32: Huh, did you actually do the expedition for Horizon Apex, or is it only iunlocked?
[0:58:44] anthechamp8932: did you install Hot Wheels on your Xbox
[0:58:54] AlexRod01234: restart the game?
[0:58:55] HashiriyaR32: .....ok, I see it, go west a bit.
[0:59:02] demon_dandy: maybe a restart as a last resort
[0:59:07] anthechamp8932: XD
[0:59:15] anthechamp8932: I think not @ansonthenintendogod28
[0:59:24] HashiriyaR32: I saw the marker for the expedition.
[0:59:35] AlexRod01234: Hmm
[0:59:36] demon_dandy: briish
[0:59:42] HungryHonk: you have to do the full campaign and complete the "hall of fame" event to unlock online and presumably the dlc
[0:59:42] HashiriyaR32: Only unlocked, the marker still has NEW on it.
[1:00:02] tetelande: Look at that corner on the map
[1:00:09] demon_dandy: miss ashton, good heavens
[1:00:30] AlexRod01234: I'll have to head to bed early tonight. I believe you will become a pro Ashton! ashton51Love
[1:00:37] hajijo: You'll earn enough points to unlock the next chapter if you do, I think, yeah!
[1:00:37] AlexRod01234: Same to chat ashton51Cheer
[1:00:48] mczub: maybe check the store tab in the pause menu?
[1:00:49] demon_dandy: have a good one alex! catch ya later
[1:01:27] HashiriyaR32: Complete it first, and then if the marker still doesn't show, double check that game is up to date AND that the DLC has been downloaded.
[1:01:30] demon_dandy: super duper last resort ashton51Tensai we'll go buy some real hot wheels toys
[1:01:47] hajijo: @HashiriyaR32 o7

[1:03:08] Playmer: your accent isn't good :P
[1:03:10] demon_dandy: they brought the lego lambo on stage!!
[1:03:14] HungryHonk: the lego dlc was for the last game
[1:04:08] HungryHonk: this game has a better map but i hate every other change they made between 4 and 5, i have like 600 hours in 4 and 20 hours in 5
[1:04:15] TheQwadFather: Hello, how are you?
[1:04:27] demon_dandy: *british accent* yo muppets on facebook thinkin ya bad mate
[1:04:45] HungryHonk: also my favourite car the amc javelin isn't in this game!! cant believe they just left it behind
[1:04:47] anthechamp8932: I k

[1:05:17] newtonia09: are we reverse driving?
[1:05:21] HashiriyaR32: She did the first chapter of "El Camino"
[1:05:44] anthechamp8932: you need to do that to unlock Hot Wheels
[1:05:47] TheQwadFather: Are you using a wheel and stuff or just a controller?
[1:06:10] anthechamp8932: oh
[1:06:12] newtonia09: the one thing I hate about colas is how they leave a thin film in your mouth
[1:06:23] mraction436: How we doing?
[1:06:49] demon_dandy: only wheel is a cheese wheel
[1:07:14] TheQwadFather: How are you today?
[1:07:27] HungryHonk: haha cheese themed steering wheel for your avatar to be holding would be so cute
[1:07:32] TheQwadFather: Doing pretty well
[1:07:51] hajijo: A friend of mine is looking to get rid of a wheel for cheap, maybe we can figure that out. Lol
[1:07:55] mraction436: Your cheesy
[1:08:48] hajijo: Surprise, it's an exploration section!
[1:08:59] hajijo: There

[1:10:22] demon_dandy: probably less car space
[1:10:29] hajijo: The line will take you to the end, so keep exploring for other stars lol
[1:10:40] TheQwadFather: It's all digital
[1:11:09] TheQwadFather: Yeah
[1:11:25] hajijo: I think this whole map is "inspired" by real life, if that makes sense
[1:11:27] TheQwadFather: I think Mexico has real ruins
[1:11:30] demon_dandy: its most likely based on real ruins id imagine
[1:12:00] TheQwadFather: That I don't know
[1:12:31] HashiriyaR32: Try the other end of the ruins
[1:12:35] demon_dandy: ancient civilizations based and pyramid-pilled
[1:12:39] hajijo: The jade statue is on the opposite end of the map!
[1:12:49] HashiriyaR32: ..too late
[1:13:03] HashiriyaR32: You don't have to
[1:13:12] demon_dandy: thats the end :(
[1:13:12] hajijo: S'all good, you don't need to do it over.
[1:13:31] anthechamp8932: you can still do it again after you completed it
[1:13:34] Hikari_with_Kremco_Inc: in before hydrolocking that engine and throwing a rod through the block :F
