[1:57:04] yojamjam: soft press to move and shoot
[1:57:07] HmmHrmHarumph: press it lightly
[1:57:10] ArthurWar: Is it pressing the trigger more gently, I think pressing it all the way down makes you stand in place
[1:57:14] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[1:57:15] whosever0: what the hell, they put a chinchilla in the mario
[1:57:28] Senoquese: ashton51Baby

[1:57:40] ThrowRacket: ever use a gamecube controller?
[1:57:41] TheAsterite: is that possible in the switch version?
[1:57:44] yojamjam: this is the significance of analog triggers
[1:57:47] AlexeiKiruv: jupijej
[1:57:50] ArthurWar: It is, you can get that behavior on the Switch port if you have a Gamecube controller
[1:57:51] Senoquese: switch removed analog yeah
[1:58:00] ThrowRacket: cube controller has analog triggers
[1:58:02] yojamjam: switch maps it to 2 buttons
[1:58:15] littleeclipse_: the GameCube trigger has two buttons within it
[1:58:15] ThrowRacket: metroid prime also used the trigger for strafing and lockon
[1:58:36] demon_dandy: The strafe looks so funny
[1:58:59] Senoquese: LOL
[1:59:01] ArthurWar: LOL
[1:59:08] rikkaonline: lol
[1:59:13] ThrowRacket: f-zero gx also allowed you to remap the gas to trigger for analog gas "pedal"
[2:00:10] WumblyGrumbly: amongus
[2:00:22] littleeclipse_: GameCube trigger had adaptive triggers before PS5 did lmao
[2:00:23] AlexeiKiruv: uwu
[2:00:25] yojamjam: f-zero gx is a cathedral of a video game
[2:00:35] ThrowRacket: by the way the piantas are really stupid and the more you interact with them the more that become apparent

[2:03:33] ArthurWar: Gamecube audio is in a bit of a weirder format and tougher to touch
[2:03:57] demon_dandy: Yessirrrr
[2:04:01] Senoquese: sm64 has plugins for blender where it turns the whole program into an editor that exports rom on its own, gamecube i had to go through dozens of forums to figure out anything like figuring out its file system

[2:21:45] KayAlamode: there's a unique truck sprite in a spot you wouldnt normally get to in the game - you have to trade a pokemon from a friend to skip a section and come back later
[2:21:45] demon_dandy: Ashton would find mew under the truck
[2:21:58] KayAlamode: and people thought there was a Mew under the truck cus it was a unique sprite in an out of reach place
[2:22:04] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[2:22:08] rikkaonline: there was a truck sprite that doesnt appear anywhere else in an offscreen area
[2:22:22] The_Great_Moof: would you still love me if i was under a truck?
[2:22:29] rikkaonline: and it was impossible to get mew on your own
[2:22:33] pogotross: you had to reset your game and lose to your rival to get cut without the SS Anne leaving, then play the rest of the game to get strength and THEN come back to try and push the truck
[2:22:46] Blue_man7: oh I'm happy cuz last time the ashton-cube was being played it was laggy, but lag-be-gone ashton51Smile
