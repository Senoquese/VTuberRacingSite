[0:24:17] rikkaonline: they arrange the parts
[0:24:24] Senoquese: arranger is when the instruments appear
[0:24:43] GManx0: They wrote it, they didnt perform it
[0:24:57] Red__2: composer doesn't know how to play the instruments or get the best sound
[0:25:03] Navy_Mongoose: think of the composer humming the melody, and the arranger deciding whther that part should be played on guitar or kazoo
[0:25:04] Senoquese: you dont always need an arranger, if the instruments need to be changed there will be one
[0:25:05] ahzree: like music structure
[0:25:07] Senoquese: but you always need a composer
[0:25:23] keternal: in most cases with electronic music those are the same person yeah
[0:25:50] keternal: but sometimes you'll see stuff like "composed by toby fox / arranged by camellia" and it has like camellia sound design
[0:25:54] Senoquese: a composer can make the core of the song but an arranger can think "this guitar would sound better if it faded in much later"
[0:26:20] Senoquese: LOLL
[0:26:23] ahzree: I feel like I see the word arrangement on more like jrpgs and stuff with like orchestral instruments involved idk
[0:26:25] ArthurWar: Arrangements could be made with the purpose of a specific kind of performance, like marching band or concert band-specific arrangements
[0:26:27] redactedenheim: I don't get it either so we're both dumb
