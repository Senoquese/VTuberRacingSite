[0:27:35] Kitkattack: One of the first streams I watched you told The cocoa powder story
[0:27:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @behoimi__ She throws then after lighting their tails on fire
[0:28:02] the_ol_regular: That’s the reason why I wanna finish one From Software game before starting a new one
[0:28:04] plazynoodles: DS2 is divisive i think
[0:28:10] Funchucks: to be fair, they took some brutal difficulty factors out of Dark Souls in updates, so people first impression of its difficulty was significant higher than the current experience
[0:28:17] JTBun: DS2 is alright
[0:28:32] ApocalypseSC: ds2 is worth playing at least once
[0:28:37] plazynoodles: maybe theres yassification mods for chara creation
[0:28:51] the_ol_regular: From what I heard, the very first PC port was scuffed compared to the original PS3 version
[0:28:55] plazynoodles: WTF... SO SAD
[0:28:57] ApocalypseSC: i made taylor swift in elden ring :3 but idk how the bb character creation compares
[0:28:59] T33bags: I used to do the randomize glitch where the nose would turn into tucan length

[0:30:51] the_ol_regular: We need a western cowboy Souls-Like
[0:31:08] mrvacbob: you can tell lies of p isn't a western game because all their marketing is like "yeah this is just a total copy of dark souls"
[0:31:09] T33bags: Sony co-owns the rights to bloodbourne with fromsoft so both of them have to make an agreement to do anything with bloodbourne and Sony is probably the one that’s not letting it go anywhere
[0:31:13] Kitkattack: I mean the first dark souls original PC port is totally non functional on steam
[0:31:14] mrvacbob: americans wouldn't admit that
[0:31:24] horribleham: Oh, sorry, that was us

[0:36:59] plazynoodles: restoring the old japanese houses i heard is EXTREMELY expensive and not worth
[0:37:16] plazynoodles: when i was in portland the historic houses were soooo pretty
[0:37:27] BNMotive: its nice because you dont have to live in an old house
[0:37:32] horribleham: most old houses are not worth it from the money side
[0:37:36] horribleham: EXPENSIVE
[0:37:40] Kitkattack: Just the cost of getting rid of waste materials at dump I understand is crazy expensive in japan
[0:37:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Did you learn that from Mighty Car Mods?
[0:37:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: but yes its wabi sabi
[0:37:53] the_ol_regular: Is it possible to commission a house on your image?
[0:37:56] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten it means beauty is in imperfection.

[2:09:55] Navy_Mongoose: you need to lie to him to win?
[2:10:15] TheDragonsBBQ: you can dodge... out of a attack, but you can't I frame the dodge
[2:10:25] Returner7: i know they changed things up since the demo, but this game really prefers you use counters & parries
[2:10:56] Returner7: *i believe
[2:11:20] Returner7: at least it was the case when I played the demo
[2:12:02] NunyaBizniz: does he speak in wingdings lol

[2:14:40] horribleham: so far the designs of everything has been pretty cool
[2:14:55] BNMotive: learn P discipline

[2:36:07] Burr11: lol
[2:36:14] Burr11: you should not get hit
[2:36:22] deadeye99088: Go to the merchant and buy thermite and throw it on him during 2 phase and then use crystals to fill you heavy attacks and DPS him
[2:36:48] RENETTE_DING: styliz4OMEGALUL
[2:37:17] Burr11: BOOM
[2:37:46] Burr11: omg ash
[2:38:26] Burr11: yeah gotta learn
[2:38:31] TheDragonsBBQ: you could try the jab and run or just stand in place and just practice blocking everything before attacking
[2:38:35] Returner7: just gotta practice
[2:38:51] JamsVirtual: this boss taught me how to actually block lol
[2:38:57] Burr11: i mean.. thats why they have a second phase ashton51Tehe
[2:39:02] deadeye99088: No it doesn't do too much to him and don't forget to use your left arm to do DPS it good in a pinch
[2:39:27] Burr11: oh yeah she hasnt been using it.. might be good when he's staggered
[2:40:03] Kitkattack: good good good ashton51Cheer
[2:40:03] Burr11: like this part when hes changing phase
[2:40:27] Burr11: theres one parry.. oh no
[2:40:51] JamsVirtual: noooo....
[2:40:55] Kitkattack: maybe dodging is the strat
[2:41:46] JamsVirtual: yeah i had to just be really defensive for one fight and learn his 2nd phase move set
[2:41:47] Burr11: can probably jab and run like was mentioned earlier but if she wants to master parrying then stick with it i guess
[2:41:58] JamsVirtual: to be able to parry
[2:42:28] Burr11: nice!
[2:42:32] deadeye99088: 2 phase screwed me up big time every time I would attack him I get hit with his swings 2 and die
[2:42:35] Burr11: still got a  heal
[2:42:57] Returner7: you parried it! it is parryable!
[2:42:59] Burr11: yessss
[2:43:02] JamsVirtual: nicee!!!

[3:37:49] mushi_buns: Your character has such lesbian energy
[3:37:50] ApocalypseSC: ashton51Omega 󠀀
[3:37:51] Dakkatooth: A soulsborne game that's just a comedy
[3:37:52] Kitkattack: ashton51Kneel
[3:37:56] Navy_Mongoose: probably little gaps like dank souls
[3:38:17] dax812: Isn't Elden Ring kinda the daytime Soulsborne?
[3:38:29] Navy_Mongoose: there's plenty of bright areas in dark souls though
[3:38:53] reycallsounds: well like one where its not all.... doom and gloom
[3:38:58] dax812: Actually yeah DS3 was pretty bright
[3:39:03] dax812: until they shove you undergound
[3:39:11] Navy_Mongoose: For example, Anor Londo... until you kill the mommy
[3:39:32] dax812: I've only played DS3 I'm a normie ashton51Wibble
[3:39:41] faizdanyal: Heyya Ashton.
[3:39:49] dax812: ashton51Tehe
[3:39:50] Playmer: Gwyndolin is annoying, not hard
[3:39:53] Navy_Mongoose: DS2 specifically had a lighting engine that encouraged you to use a torch
[3:39:54] JTBun: DS3 is great tho
[3:40:17] Navy_Mongoose: Yeah, Gwyndolin isn't very hard, but a rather unique encounter
[3:40:31] Navy_Mongoose: rip
[3:40:32] dax812: Noooo she lied and died ashton51Steer
[3:41:07] Playmer: To be clear, obviously people can have issues with Gwyndolin, but they're usually overthinking it. They have like 3 moves to learn and two of them you can hide behind a pillar for.
[3:41:47] reycallsounds: pls rember that wen u feel scare or frigten never forget ttimes wen u feeled happy
[3:41:47] Navy_Mongoose: Gqynevere is the mommy
[3:41:52] Navy_Mongoose: Gwynevere
[3:41:59] Playmer: She's an Onee-san, not a mommy
[3:42:10] mushi_buns: ashton51Steer
[3:42:11] Navy_Mongoose: the cheapest shot
[3:42:14] reycallsounds: rip lol
[3:42:22] reycallsounds: i love that lil coppy pasta of happy day

[3:51:20] MeeraOctavia: I am not enjoying the fact you can't dodge cancel haha
[3:51:24] Matharu_: mathar3Vanish
[3:51:25] Inkeri_Valerien: Meera is stuck grinding at the forge at the (i think) 4th big boss
[3:51:28] ApocalypseSC: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:51:31] dax812: Ashton how do you feel about this game's developer saying it "wasn't intentional" that this game is like Bloodborne ashton51Pog
[3:51:37] Dakkatooth: AY HOLD UP. When did that mf come from his camping spot?
[3:51:59] Inkeri_Valerien: It wasnt intentional to be similar to BB? I doubt
[3:52:02] dax812: they said that like 2 years ago so maybe they just went all in after that point
[3:52:10] Inkeri_Valerien: Its just Bloodborne in france
[3:52:29] Dakkatooth: Unless you got a gun that's your parry mechanic, it ain't that much similar to BB
[3:52:42] Inkeri_Valerien: similar inspiration bringing similar results
[3:52:46] ReyJaggy: dolls, puppets same dif, its (not) bloodborne
[3:52:47] Dakkatooth: True
[3:52:54] Burr11: cant believe they're doing our twink like that
[3:53:06] Inkeri_Valerien: distinctly very similar from bb but with similar vibes
[3:53:06] Dakkatooth: LOL French Bloodborne
[3:53:07] dax812: Bloodborne if Timothy Chalamet
[3:53:14] dax812: quiet up and listen down
[3:53:32] Burr11: whoa that was perfect
[3:53:37] Burr11: i think you i framed him
[3:53:45] Inkeri_Valerien: they just wanna get the soot out of ya
[3:54:02] Burr11: omg
[3:54:18] dax812: what if you just lie instead of die
[3:54:43] ApocalypseSC: dies of p 😭
[3:54:43] Inkeri_Valerien: I think the next stargaser is after the roofs so once you clear it you should be safe
[3:54:46] Inkeri_Valerien: I believe
[3:55:30] MrBolodenka: @dax812 That's the same as saying that every souls-like game was never intended to be a souls-like even though the only major difference is the environment and story while the combat, mechanics, and movement are basically a carbon copy of Dark Souls with minor changes and adjustments
[3:55:36] Inkeri_Valerien: cptcamPray
[3:56:29] Dakkatooth: Soulslike games are just a roulette of what poison's gonna kill you
[3:57:09] Playmer: but there's no trick weapons...
[3:57:12] Dakkatooth: Bloodborne is more isolated.
[3:57:35] ApocalypseSC: I've found one weapon that changes but it's not a significant change like bb weapons
[3:57:48] JTBun: no transforming weapons, but still a mechanic taken from Sekiro instead
[3:57:55] Playmer: The weird thing about this is that it's a weird hybrid of bloodborne and sekiro, with their own flourishes on top
[3:57:57] Dakkatooth: You know, for a bunch of dummies, they got a good throwing arm
[3:58:13] Inkeri_Valerien: ashton51Squish
[3:58:32] JTBun: no, the arm with multiple attachments/tools is taken directly from sekiro
[3:59:15] Playmer: Want a tiny hint for the next stargazer?
[3:59:40] Playmer: Well that's a chest
[3:59:49] Playmer: But yeah it's just past him
[4:00:08] Inkeri_Valerien: Stargaser get!
[4:00:11] Inkeri_Valerien: OH NO

[5:06:20] NanaseCain: it's not a crime if nobody finds out
[5:06:23] KKCYBER: gonna get some late dinner tho!!!
[5:06:25] SamKnytt: alright so the burning question I've been wondering since they announced this one...... is game good?
[5:06:51] SamKnytt: YES
[5:06:58] barfchan: it really is bloodborne 2
[5:07:21] InsaneLoke: you still need to play the Jedi games...
[5:07:21] SamKnytt: bloodborne is one of my favorites ever, but I sold my PS4 and I've missed it
[5:07:25] kronofski: is the LORE good though
[5:07:28] barfchan: it was reminding me a lot of the demons souls remake too
[5:07:30] SamKnytt: YES I'VE PLAYED CODE VEIN IT'S REALLY GOOD
[5:07:39] DROWXXI: cheer100 niyakaHeadpat niyakaTail
[5:07:39] SamKnytt: Code Vein is like, really really easy, but I liked it
[5:07:47] zayhha: its one of the few souls-likes that actually took the right lessons from the souls games
[5:07:53] dingletoast: The lore is connected to God Eater so the lore is OK
[5:08:02] kronofski: itch scratcher desu i understand desu
[5:08:06] DROWXXI: ashy pikoyiVibe
[5:08:13] barfchan: dehumanization of the working class ResidentSleeper
[5:08:21] gam3rd00d6: hai there ✌🏼
[5:08:34] gam3rd00d6: how are you
[5:08:45] mrvacbob: that's what the original pinocchio story was about
[5:08:47] DROWXXI: ashton51Squish
[5:08:49] barfchan: there was a sign around here that was like "bourgeois street" or something it was SO on the nose lmao
[5:08:55] SamKnytt: FromSoft's themes in every game are always amazing, especially old Armored Core games they're so fucking good hgioahgioehtioe
[5:09:11] gam3rd00d6: whoever thought Lies of P will have the same dark souls style but with Pinocchio
[5:09:16] Raiztt: president rat sent me
[5:09:37] Heroes_of_Vale: You broke his sword
[5:09:43] InsaneLoke: ashhhhh.... ash.... you need to play the two jedi games... oooooo....
[5:10:12] SamKnytt: FromSoft has always done allusions to capitalism, but it's always been subtle. It's more been about comparing kings, Greek Gods, and other forms of power to capitalism and letting the player figure out who they want to side from from there
[5:10:17] SamKnytt: sorry I'm such a fucking nerd
[5:10:23] SamKnytt: i love souls

[5:11:16] bravongo: Kinda reminds me of Eldin ring
[5:11:17] InsaneLoke: quality acting
[5:11:20] ActionMaverick: Geppetto why did you create this ABOMINATION

[5:16:01] SamKnytt: humu humu
[5:16:14] SamKnytt: naruhodo
[5:16:33] bravongo: Been lurking here always.
[5:17:14] SamKnytt: happy pride
[5:17:18] InsaneLoke: that was good nasal

[5:19:39] SamKnytt: well undertale has a universal save with checks that stick even when you select new game
[5:19:48] SamKnytt: which bloodborne does not do
[5:19:50] barfchan: ichimaiaBrain
[5:19:55] bravongo: @SamKnytt My favorite game ever. fun fact
[5:20:27] barfchan: it should autosave but if you go to exit it'll save again
[5:20:40] SamKnytt: but yes that kind of thing with cycles and the cyclical nature of the world has been a thing with FromSoft games since Armored Core 1 in the 90's
[5:20:46] SamKnytt: possibly even King's Field before that
[5:20:52] metaconstruct: mershin bler
[5:20:58] SamKnytt: GOOD WORK TONIGHT
