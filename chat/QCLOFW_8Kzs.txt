[1:49:48] cakeswindle: Its set in the 60s which is when bond started, i think thats the only link
[1:50:23] cakeswindle: My main skill in majong is being able to swallow the pieces whole
[1:50:26] science_mclovin: Mahjong is about not getting Ron'd 100%
[1:50:28] maullarmaullar: yeah mahjong has a really big RNG element, it can take quite a few games for skill differences to be apparent
[1:50:36] maullarmaullar: yes, 3 is chronologically first

[1:51:24] Returner7: quite likely, but if they keep the base game it should be great
