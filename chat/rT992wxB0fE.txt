[0:51:09] RycegoZ: Voyeurism is C-D tier, none of the doujins do any good with it, and sometimes it detracts from the story due to it's absurdity
[0:51:10] Burr11: this is where she talks about never seeing actual porn but then it turns out she did for a couple minutes
[0:51:13] RyanCider: is voyeurism similar to ntr?

[2:16:28] RyanCider: but that song was about liking all types of women though?
[2:16:31] rikkaonline: the song was years old, one person was shitty to him and their followers just rationalized it
[2:16:40] RycegoZ: Didn't something similar happen to the guy who made the "Anatomy of a Gamer" meme
[2:17:08] rikkaonline: there really wasnt any depth to the actual hate
[2:17:21] ZippiBelfast: it's the new twitter art meme
[2:17:31] RyanCider: @RycegoZ instant noodles and energy drinks

[2:18:21] Robert_Brown_: Also lead to lots of people not Quote-RT the original because it's too much
[2:18:49] Robert_Brown_: I think the "child gf" on the original art alone put people off
[2:18:53] mboy32: shoutouts to Chris handson
[2:19:01] T33bags: that‚Äôs because you follow a lot of vtubers ashton
[2:19:01] ZippiBelfast: Could do it with the race lady. Make a chilla the small chatter on the side
[2:19:31] RyanCider: @Robert_Brown_ child gf different from loli?
[2:19:31] demon_dandy: you do love your high cut shorts ashton51Tehe
[2:19:31] Burr11: the original person behind it got suspended
[2:19:38] czerno333: @Robert_Brown_ that and the "okay that's a funny post i'll just click on this guy's profile to see what else they've made. oh."
[2:19:48] ReyJaggy: @Burr11 mass report maybe

[2:20:13] RyanCider: thoughts on loli or not appropriate topic? kitsLurk
[2:20:30] RycegoZ: Loli Ashton would be interesting
[2:20:31] rikkaonline: child gf seems like the kind of content elon would want to protect on his platform

[2:23:55] czerno333: how about those adult women huh
[2:23:56] RycegoZ: Have you seen the "Lebron Scream if you Love..." meme?
[2:24:00] Robert_Brown_: They can be pretty cute drawings and allegedly some (petite) women simply relate because they are tiny too
[2:24:03] Ichorum: ashton51Squish < these are my thoughts
[2:24:07] RyanCider: truee
[2:24:11] ReyJaggy: thoughts on that new Nikke naked character, good anatomy reference
[2:24:22] Burr11: yeah i dont get people that cant just admit it is a bit weird and perverse
[2:24:27] fixedspectacles2014: Thoughts on chillas?
[2:24:35] RyanCider: @ReyJaggy full on naked?
[2:24:40] demon_dandy: Oh yeah didnt vshojo get the nikke collab?
[2:25:00] czerno333: a lot of the nikke designs don't really appeal to me but that Elegg girl is cute
[2:25:04] RyanCider: do you play any of those mobile gacha games like Nikke or Azur Lane?
[2:25:17] ReyJaggy: @RyanCider they wear a blanket, shiny light and a dream
[2:25:34] ZippiBelfast: I like a few nikke designs but I cannot remember any of their names
[2:25:55] Burr11: most of the nikke designs i saw just have massive dumpy, dont really care for that..
[2:25:56] demon_dandy: I like that new irritating girl in nikke
[2:26:12] Burr11: same with stellar blade
[2:26:13] RyanCider: @Burr11 what about Azur Lane?
[2:26:16] czerno333: no belly button... she's a clone. sad!
[2:26:21] demon_dandy: yeah LMAOOOOO
[2:26:27] RyanCider: Are these considered booty shorts?
[2:26:36] Kitkattack: syuen yeah she's actually a total asshole
[2:26:41] Burr11: i'm way more into Kantai Collection than Azur Lane, though some of their designs are cute
[2:26:45] InsaneLoke: hello ladyo
[2:26:53] ZippiBelfast: Just cover it with fluff. It's fine.
[2:26:53] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:26:55] ReyJaggy: give her a fade and a muller
[2:26:58] RycegoZ: I wonder what Ashy with a Mohawk would look like

[2:27:00] RyanCider: ashton51Omegalul
[2:27:00] rikkaonline: do it, own the gap
[2:27:06] thomas2uentin: isn't 4 ears more whack?
[2:27:14] Burr11: but i will say Azur Lane has no consistency with loli battleships and stuff.. Kancolle has more thought in its designs instead  of just pure fetish
[2:27:15] demon_dandy: i tried to give you a swept back hair one time
[2:27:19] RyanCider: 4 ears?
[2:27:22] Senoquese: ewwww

[2:27:54] RyanCider: how would ashton wear ear muffs?
[2:27:57] gosher: what if you just had a hairband with fake human ears
[2:28:06] rikkaonline: idk would the spot just be filled with hair since theres no ear to go around?
[2:28:08] demon_dandy: It was the white day art, i just hid the ear spot with like a hair tie ashton51Tehe
[2:28:14] RyanCider: @gosher ashton51Omegalul
[2:28:19] laser3365: You have a tail?
[2:28:19] ChessCatUWU: You're probably literally sitting on it too.
[2:28:33] RyanCider: ghostysNoted
[2:28:44] ZippiBelfast: 4 ears is fine. I just prefer drawing 2.
[2:28:45] RycegoZ: So you're saying they're twice as weak to flashbangs
[2:28:49] NightHawk_the_Chilla: See, spice and wolf does it right with Holo and Myuri.
[2:28:51] Burr11: i prefer 2 hairs but 4 isn't a deal breaker

[2:30:25] Burr11: @RyanCider not really, she's not taking care of and spoiling.. they are in a relationship of sorts though
[2:30:30] fixedspectacles2014: You should draw your shreksona next time
[2:30:31] demon_dandy: You dont draw them shreklike ashton51Tehe
[2:30:34] gosher: some people find shrek cute
[2:30:40] demon_dandy: shrek is like tube ass ears

[2:30:47] thomas2uentin: Chinchillas are like onions?
[2:30:52] ZippiBelfast: I need to get going. Thanks for the art stream. Have a great one, race lady.
[2:30:53] RyanCider: @Burr11 lunacy4Noted more mature?

[2:31:21] RyanCider: ashton hears good
[2:31:21] TheAsterite: i just got down inside a 38s lap on wario stadium
[2:31:24] demon_dandy: I always draw them big ass saucer ears

[2:31:43] RyanCider: @Burr11 lunacy4Wow
[2:31:48] czerno333: the ahoge of an anime girl is a 4th dimensional piece of anatomy that resists mortal concepts such as "perspective"
[2:31:51] NightHawk_the_Chilla: Hey Ash, can I get a Happy birfday before it ends? ashton51Squish
[2:32:05] RyanCider: are ahoges natural or do you need to style the hair ?
[2:32:22] RycegoZ: Ashy, quick question, but isn't Waffle House just Southern Hibachi?
[2:32:40] RyanCider: Pim's exposed nerve ending is ahoge?

[2:43:23] thomas2uentin: SICK
[2:43:33] demon_dandy: The pose is kinda the "we irritatin ashton51Tehe " pose
[2:43:36] fixedspectacles2014: ArtJerma
[2:43:48] Robert_Brown_: does your revenue share say 60/40? I saw a few people complaining they still had 50/50 listed despite hitting Tier 1 of partner plus
[2:43:48] InsaneLoke: oh shit did i miss the collab announcement or is that tomorrow
[2:44:09] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:44:17] RyanCider: @InsaneLoke there's collab?

[2:45:05] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[2:45:06] Senoquese: whats the point of living if no ashton feet...
[2:45:20] RyanCider: @Senoquese where did that come from? jackehHuh
[2:45:27] RyanCider: chinchilla paws
[2:45:48] demon_dandy: cause she had to hide the feet
[2:46:02] Robert_Brown_: Metallic might be mostly about the type of reflection gold fabric gives, the specular highlights and the dull reflection
[2:46:03] RyanCider: shadows fufuLewd
[2:46:05] InsaneLoke: metallic isnt that tough, its just weird stripe pattern
[2:46:10] Robert_Brown_: pretty good yellow
[2:46:29] RyanCider: sheesh
[2:46:34] Robert_Brown_: It's so interesting how much small details change on a painting
[2:46:40] RyanCider: have you posted any of your tradiitonal paintings?
[2:47:04] InsaneLoke: slightly sag... slightly hag....
[2:47:33] RyanCider: marine has gold bikini art?

[2:47:44] InsaneLoke: ill go check
[2:47:46] demon_dandy: LMAO

[2:47:52] Burr11: danbooru doesnt have any gold bikini art of her
[2:48:04] ChessCatUWU: ichimaiaAwooga
[2:48:12] Senoquese: ashton51Stare
[2:48:13] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[2:48:13] Burr11: https://twitter.com/tonagi_/status/1784530464742781429 here's a huge titty bikini marine i found
[2:48:18] Burr11: its not gold though
[2:48:22] laser3365: @Burr11 konachan?
[2:48:35] ReyJaggy: @jamwes_art has some recent good gold bikini art
[2:48:41] Robert_Brown_: danbooru doesn't seem to have it
[2:48:56] Senoquese: boobs arent symmetric irl yeah
[2:49:24] Robert_Brown_: People seem to mess up boob size with perspective often, like the closer to the camera one being bigger
[2:49:26] ReyJaggy: theres no hastag for it?
[2:49:35] Robert_Brown_: or was it reverse?
[2:49:51] demon_dandy: Then you gotta account for squish or if theyre leaning ashton51Tehe
[2:49:59] Robert_Brown_: yeah I think they try making them the same size but due to perspective the farther one looks bigger
[2:50:01] Burr11: kancolle actually has a character with different size boobs, saratoga.. it's a reference to the actual ship lol
[2:50:05] demon_dandy: this shit get deadly serious
[2:50:12] ReyJaggy: i found one for golden week but no bikinis lol
[2:50:14] Robert_Brown_: pretty good yellow
[2:50:15] Burr11: https://kancolle.fandom.com/wiki/Saratoga
[2:50:43] Burr11: yes its the intent
[2:51:05] Senoquese: hell yeah
[2:51:10] RyanCider: we failed you enriSadge
[2:51:10] Senoquese: share
[2:51:10] JTBun: lets go
[2:51:14] Burr11: #GW„ÅØ„Éï„Ç©„É≠„ÉØ„Éº„ÅåÂ¢ó„Åà„Çã„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ this one?
[2:51:26] Burr11: its just a generic art retweet tag though
[2:51:32] Robert_Brown_: here are the hashtags: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/golden-bikini-week
[2:52:17] Senoquese: knowyourmeme is such a funny source
[2:52:17] Burr11: ahh
[2:52:33] mboy32: Shhineee
[2:52:39] RycegoZ: Extra shiny
[2:52:48] demon_dandy: go for gold gold ashton51Tehe
[2:53:03] demon_dandy: If youre not tired or nothin
[2:53:11] Robert_Brown_: It's too bad that artists don't use proper hashtags most of the time
[2:53:20] Burr11: based that trend started because of a kancolle artist lol
[2:53:41] RyanCider: @Senoquese how so?
[2:53:44] renshi111: Cheer100
[2:53:47] RyanCider: was the hashtag in english or japanese?
[2:55:09] fixedspectacles2014: I know the plan was a golden bikini but what if you made it a cheese bikini
[2:55:21] ReyJaggy: timeline is cursed no bikinis in sight
[2:55:39] ChessCatUWU: Cheese? ichimaiaZoom
[2:55:45] rikkaonline: better put some swiss cheese holes in it then
[2:55:48] JTBun: yeah I havent seen much
[2:56:08] Senoquese: ive only seen one post
[2:56:09] Robert_Brown_: They might be on Misskey or Pixiv
[2:56:38] Robert_Brown_: the bolden bow is pretty cute
[2:56:51] demon_dandy: ‚ùå WRONG TAKE
[2:56:56] rikkaonline: i doubt it
[2:57:01] demon_dandy: nah i dunno
[2:57:09] czerno333: i wouldn't be surprised if some of it was ad-libbed but there's no way a production like that woulda been unscripted in its entirety
[2:57:10] fixedspectacles2014: An animed movie being unscripted sounds insane
[2:57:17] czerno333: great movie though
[2:57:23] ReyJaggy: like fully unscripted or some parts were improv?
[2:57:34] demon_dandy: its probably scripted but they went off script a bunch?
[2:57:40] rikkaonline: i dont think a studio would let it go that wild, but bits of improv happen
[2:58:06] Senoquese: not that it wasnt unscripted, it didnt have a *whole* script
[2:58:12] Senoquese: as in a document with all of it together
[2:58:16] demon_dandy: ooooo
[2:58:21] rikkaonline: a more mild version ive heard is that robin williams didnt have a script for aladdin
[2:58:32] yojamjam: NICE
[2:58:33] demon_dandy: It isssss
[2:58:33] rikkaonline: woah
[2:58:33] ReyJaggy: it is
[2:58:40] mushi_buns: WOW
[2:58:41] laser3365: pretty decent.
[2:58:46] NightHawk_the_Chilla: It's coming together
[2:59:10] Senoquese: so it was produced like normal and it was scripted, just that they didnt have a finalized document with the entire script put together, only drafts and separate pieces
[2:59:11] demon_dandy: wtf my streamer can render??
[2:59:22] Robert_Brown_: where does the light come from? or are you going off a reference in a similar pose?
[2:59:22] ChessCatUWU: WOAH
[2:59:24] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[2:59:27] Senoquese: shading is so much more fun than lineart!!!!!!
[2:59:28] ReyJaggy: top of the pad also needs some darker highlights but its taking shape
[2:59:41] NightHawk_the_Chilla: I know next to nothing of art so this looks like magic to me.
[2:59:41] RyanCider: WOW
[2:59:48] demon_dandy: sasuga ashton ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel

[3:01:54] Senoquese: you will NOT believe how round this chilla is
[3:01:54] TheAsterite: eyy, getting the hang of it. now i need a break
[3:01:58] demon_dandy: let her cook
[3:03:47] fixedspectacles2014: The gold stands out so much when nothing else is colored
[3:04:02] ReyJaggy: ‚ö†Ô∏è
[3:04:12] demon_dandy: its always funny when its a sketch then super rendering boobs and bikini ashton51Tehe
[3:04:21] demon_dandy: rendered*
[3:04:42] Senoquese: is it such a crime to wanna draw attention to the boobies
[3:04:59] ChessCatUWU: Can't just leave the important parts once all of the creative juices have started flowing, gotta finish while you can.
[3:05:12] mboy32: Ashton uses axe
[3:05:16] Senoquese: a little sweat goes a long way
[3:05:35] ChessCatUWU: Seeing the new rendering on the bikini looks a bit better after ignoring it for a second.
[3:06:00] demon_dandy: damnnnnn i love the gold standing out
