[0:34:19] GManx0: Why
[0:34:21] T33bags: well the way I see it is femcels are similar to incels in that it’s more about the thought process rather than actually celibacy
[0:34:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: thats what cel in incel means?
[0:34:25] Jeremeymcdude: Incel is Involuntary
[0:34:39] InsaneLoke: no one should hit on anyone, everyone should just hover standoffishly
[0:34:42] RycegoZ: Femcel is just the new E-girl, everyone is just claiming to be one
[0:34:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: OHHH right.
[0:34:55] Kitkattack: omg I just looked at the webpage and it's down LuL

[5:24:28] gozuutennoh: but the fighting games are so fun
[5:24:28] keydget: Thats true
[5:24:31] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[5:24:31] ZippiBelfast: I know, I've tried so hard to get people to actually play the game
[5:24:36] ZippiBelfast: But a shmup is a hard sell
[5:24:39] czerno333: but yeah touhou is basically the background radiation of indie games, anime spaces, and meme culture
[5:24:39] barfchan: luna nights doesn't count ashton51Tensai
[5:24:40] Senoquese: touhou fans only care about the armpits
[5:24:43] InsaneLoke: not quite

[5:26:23] Navy_Mongoose: 2hu is real;ly fucking easy compared to the rest of the shmup genre
[5:26:29] nekobun: Reiko was in Rage Racer before Type 4, but 4 is her first numbered entry yeah.
[5:26:35] Senoquese: NOT THE FIRST ONE
[5:26:38] Not_Kamille: I started with Ridge Racer 64.
[5:26:39] ZippiBelfast: First one is on PC98 so probably the 6th one
[5:26:39] justcerebro: I always mean insane good unless I say insane (derogatory) ashton51Smile
[5:26:43] Navy_Mongoose: 1st one isn't a shmup
[5:26:50] flickmannss: try the 2hu fighting games maybe
[5:26:52] c_v_catullus16: Now I only think about the Sony E3 2006 press conference whenever I hear Ridge Racer.
[5:26:53] gozuutennoh: 10 is the easiest mainline one to start with
[5:26:54] ZippiBelfast: But 6th one requires a stupid patch because pc's are too fast nowadays so it'll run at 10k frames a second
[5:27:07] Navy_Mongoose: Start with anything Touhou 6 and beyond
[5:27:11] Not_Kamille: It's a bit sad Ridge Racer isn't coming back

[5:27:53] flickmannss: you mean bandai namco
[5:27:53] Navy_Mongoose: Touhou 7 is my absolute favorite, you should play that one because it stole the precious thing
