[1:03:41] Burr11: It's funny how one or two comments spawned another survey
[1:03:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They have to be plugged in before the game gets loaded.
[1:03:51] demon_dandy: Turbo woah...
[1:04:02] Burr11: ashton51Omegalul
[1:04:05] JaAmfan: turbo just removes slowdown from the original games. really it's up to you
[1:04:09] yojamjam: restart game with controller connected, usually the case with steam games
[1:04:11] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[1:04:14] JaAmfan: I personally play original
[1:04:17] Senoquese: it only started because i thought i was missing out and that kit being a hater was a joke so i asked what was up..........
[1:04:19] Burr11: I miss the days computers had a turbo button
[1:04:29] JackJaguar_: what's this??? Ash is playing my favorite series? hell yeah!!!
[1:04:35] Navy_Mongoose: restart game?
[1:04:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Restart the game with the controller plugged in
[1:04:44] demon_dandy: ashton51Happi ashton51Happi ashton51Happi
[1:04:54] Apache1990: Yeah, a lot of games hate hotswapping controllers
[1:04:55] demon_dandy: void ashton51Nightmare

[1:05:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Despair
[1:05:12] JackJaguar_: Ash you need to jump and shoot
[1:05:23] RockLobster52: what kind of controller are you using?
[1:05:25] Senoquese: we're allowed to backseat in exchange of being called annoying ashton51Angy
[1:05:25] Burr11: ashton51Despair
[1:05:26] RycegoZ: Erm, Skill Issue, have you considered "Git Gud"
[1:05:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: is it an xbox controller or ps controller?
[1:05:45] JaAmfan: you can pick the Difficult option from the menu in the american version
[1:05:46] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:05:52] RockLobster52: I think PS4 should be fine then, have you used it before on steam games?
[1:06:02] Based_Hopper: You wouldn't have this problem with an Xbox controller
[1:06:04] RockLobster52: might need to configure the buttons through steam first
[1:06:05] Kitkattack: bathed in fire
[1:06:07] Navy_Mongoose: just keep in US version
[1:06:08] JackJaguar_: "Normal" is Easy
[1:06:10] JaAmfan: you'll know pretty quick if it's too tough
[1:06:10] RycegoZ: You should so we could see you mald more
[1:06:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i tested it iwth an xbox controller so idk about ps4

[1:06:29] JackJaguar_: you totally got this!
[1:06:29] caratecaa: U.S difficulty is fine and challenging enough
[1:06:33] Burr11: Time to whip out your Xbox controller instead
[1:06:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: rockman unless you wanna read and translate for us wont be worth.
[1:06:46] Navy_Mongoose: Hard mode is the original japanese difficulty which just changes damage numbers + unique enmy features
[1:06:48] JaAmfan: @caratecaa agree, especially for your first mega man
[1:06:57] demon_dandy: That was me sorry, drrring
[1:07:01] Senoquese: not the mouth jitter...
[1:07:01] Burr11: Yeah your mouth

[1:07:12] demon_dandy: ashton51Pop
[1:07:14] Navy_Mongoose: what the mouth doin?
[1:07:18] JackJaguar_: little squeaky noises
[1:07:20] Senoquese: when did this even start happening ashton51Tehe its been like a couple weeks like this
[1:07:37] caratecaa: You can absolutely challenge yourself with jp difficulty, but u.s is already hard. your call
[1:07:57] JaAmfan: can you open the steam input menu?
[1:07:58] Navy_Mongoose: maybe controller doesn't work on menu? try booting a game?
[1:08:03] JaAmfan: yeah NES
[1:08:08] Navy_Mongoose: yes, NES
[1:08:12] Burr11: Restart the game again now that it detected your controller mic
[1:08:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: do you have an XBOX controller?
[1:08:22] Burr11: Maybe it wasn't detected before
[1:08:36] JaAmfan: it was on PS1 and Genesis
[1:08:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it was later in life yes
[1:08:46] Navy_Mongoose: the classic colection has been ported to basically everything
[1:08:48] JackJaguar_: Fun fact: there are remakes of Mega Man 1-3 on the SEGA Genesis
[1:08:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: PS8 and up was on dreamcast and PS1
[1:08:51] JaAmfan: CAPCOM ahahghghh
[1:08:55] Burr11: Capcom silly
[1:08:59] JackJaguar_: Mega Man: The Wily Wars
[1:08:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i meant MEGAMAN 8 was on ps1 and dreamcast
[1:09:09] JackJaguar_: @mrp0p1nfr3sh PS1 and Saturn*
[1:09:09] Senoquese: lol
[1:09:18] Navy_Mongoose: sawnic is in smash
[1:09:37] yojamjam: mega man is mario's son
[1:09:39] Navy_Mongoose: iirc Sonic is the firt non-nintendo character in the smash series
[1:10:06] JaAmfan: I really do not like the Genesis ports. maybe it's just my stubbornness though
[1:10:06] OpticalLimeVT: HALLO :3
[1:10:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Megaman legacy collection 1 on switch is 8 dollars
[1:10:20] Kitkattack: I'm going to have some milk and coogy
[1:10:25] JaAmfan: anything with a Dpad
[1:10:26] OpticalLimeVT: I LOVE THE MODEL ITS SO CUTE ashton51Squish ashton51Squish
[1:10:29] JackJaguar_: I use a SNES controller
[1:10:30] Navy_Mongoose: nah, you just need 2 buttons
[1:10:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I played it on my 8bitdo xbox controller
[1:10:31] Senoquese: just any controller tbh its just a platformer
[1:10:33] Burr11: Not really it's just two buttons
[1:10:34] RockLobster52: anything with a good dpad probably
[1:10:37] anonsama9001: agreed anything with a dpad
[1:10:41] JaAmfan: yup it works great
[1:10:43] caratecaa: it's a 2d platformer, you only need a d-pad
[1:10:48] Apache1990: Since it doesn't use sticks, even keyboard is optimal
[1:10:50] yojamjam: og mega mans use so few buttons, anything with a good dpad works
[1:10:52] caratecaa: or 4 directions, really, even a keyboard works
[1:11:13] brown505guns: breaks through wall]

[1:12:32] Burr11: Not long if you're good
[1:12:36] rodetovenaar: It's short if you're good
[1:12:36] JaAmfan: no way first playthrough is an hour
[1:12:38] JackJaguar_: There's no crouch. It was thought of for the first game but they decided to keep it simple
[1:12:38] Navy_Mongoose: SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT
[1:12:40] Apache1990: Later games have Slide, but I don't think that's for a few games
[1:12:40] Navy_Mongoose: MEGA MAN!!!!!!
[1:12:41] Kitkattack: the classic
[1:12:47] Senoquese: completely depends on how good you are, if you play super well its like 2 hours

[1:12:58] yojamjam: doctuh wahwee

[1:13:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: lol
[1:13:56] Senoquese: oh good luck
[1:14:00] JackJaguar_: Air Man is actually easier buster only
[1:14:01] ForgottenBud: I still play Megamen 4 on my NES to this day.
[1:14:02] Burr11: Lol
[1:14:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Clap SO MANY DEATHS LOL
[1:14:05] Kitkattack: oh man

[1:14:33] Senoquese: hfghdfg
[1:14:36] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[1:14:38] Navy_Mongoose: Every stage can be beat with the plasma gun
[1:14:43] Burr11: ashton51Tehe
[1:14:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: is this the one you can hold the fire button to boost your attacks?
[1:15:06] JackJaguar_: actually deflected shots do nothing!
[1:15:15] anonsama9001: @mrp0p1nfr3sh i think that first appeared in 4 or 5
[1:15:16] Senoquese: youve got this ashton51Tehe
[1:15:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: AHH OK
[1:15:23] Kitkattack: this is just about as retro as it gets
[1:15:23] JaAmfan: i think the first megaman game with a crouch was X5
[1:15:29] mrp0p1nfr3sh: lmaooo
[1:15:33] rodetovenaar: oh man
[1:15:35] Burr11: Lmaooo
[1:15:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah this is unflitered megaman
[1:15:53] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, the ricochet is just there for aesthetic purposes
[1:15:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Despair
[1:15:57] Senoquese: rage, entertainment woman, rage! 😈
[1:16:02] JackJaguar_: it's just a warm up!
[1:16:05] Navy_Mongoose: you can find extra lives
[1:16:06] ZippiBelfast: Oh hey it's megadude
[1:16:07] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Airman is not the warm up
[1:16:08] Burr11: It's only one hour long tho no worries
[1:16:20] Senoquese: yeah you can do this ashton51Tehe
[1:16:21] JaAmfan: :doubt:

[1:17:19] barfchan: she's gaming
[1:17:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the museum menu has the concept art for these guys.
[1:17:36] Navy_Mongoose: she's figuring it out
[1:17:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: this music is so ashton coded
[1:17:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: no it respawns lol
[1:17:51] StreamElements: Get your scrungly Ashton Plushten before they're gone! https://studionekomata.com/collections/ashton-marten
[1:17:52] Burr11: Nope you gotta jump
[1:17:54] RockLobster52: he respawns
[1:17:57] yojamjam: blue pickups are ammo, you don't have anything that uses ammo yet
[1:18:01] Navy_Mongoose: you can find extra lives, and sometimes enemies drop them
[1:18:04] ZippiBelfast: Rule of nes. If it's offscreen it's probably gonna respawn
[1:18:05] ForgottenBud: it's dropped an energy tank for when you get powers
[1:18:06] Apache1990: Anyone offscreen respawns, for the most part
[1:18:14] Burr11: That's not air man
[1:18:20] anonsama9001: yup classic NES respawning enemeies lol
[1:18:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: whenever your screen deloads a section enemies respawn in megaman
[1:18:31] JackJaguar_: you did it!
[1:18:37] barfchan: classic
[1:18:39] JackJaguar_: say hello to the Pipis

[1:19:04] JackJaguar_: schworm spotted
[1:19:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BRO GOT WORMS
[1:19:05] Navy_Mongoose: wiggly blue bacon
[1:19:18] ForgottenBud: the white/yellow items they drop is health and the blue ones are for energy
[1:19:19] hopsity: catJAM
[1:19:34] barfchan: ashton51Stare
[1:19:39] Burr11: Pretty forgiving.. dies
[1:19:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Stare
[1:19:43] Navy_Mongoose: you get checkpoints, it's ok
[1:19:53] Apache1990: One trick is if you take damage, you're temporarily invincible, so you can pass things with it
[1:19:57] taz168821: Awww man
[1:19:59] ZippiBelfast: Classsic megaman
[1:20:00] Burr11: ashton51Despair game over
[1:20:02] ForgottenBud: TheForgottenKami subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:20:02] Navy_Mongoose: no
[1:20:04] anonsama9001: lol no
[1:20:09] hopsity: dear god no
[1:20:11] Navy_Mongoose: you can find extra lives like Mario
[1:20:13] JackJaguar_: your stage progress is saved after you beat a boss
[1:20:25] taz168821: Owie
[1:20:29] Burr11: It'd be pretty boring if they just dropped you on the boss
[1:20:38] Redamaford: Yeah, game has passwords.
[1:21:03] compositefrylock: you seeing any movies this weekend?
[1:21:14] Senoquese: using passwords is intentional
[1:21:14] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we didnt have saves back then
[1:21:16] Burr11: Nah it's not cheating
[1:21:17] ZippiBelfast: Password is part of the game.
[1:21:21] StreamElements: I have my own flavor of AdvancedGG Energy available for purchase through July right now!!! Get your tub of Race Queen Ramune and don't forget your Ashton Marten shaker for a crisp refreshing summer with me! 🥤  https://advanced.gg/pages/partner-ashton-marten?ref=ashton
[1:21:26] JackJaguar_: it never had an arcade style way of beating it
[1:21:26] hopsity: passwords are good for if you wanna stop at a certain spot.
[1:21:29] compositefrylock: Logan and Wade’s excellent adventure
[1:21:29] Navy_Mongoose: no, if you need to take a break you can write down the password to resume your progress later
[1:21:33] Burr11: Does legacy collection have saves
[1:21:33] caratecaa: Passwords is the save mechanic for games without the technology for saving
[1:21:35] JackJaguar_: even the first game saves bosses defeated
[1:21:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: passwords are the only way you could play games back in the day.
[1:21:57] JackJaguar_: the Genesis remakes give you save files

[1:22:26] JackJaguar_: gotta defeat the schworm spawner
[1:22:38] ZippiBelfast: Megaman games have great music
[1:22:48] Navy_Mongoose: Mega Man music is addicting
[1:23:10] Kitkattack: these are pretty dam tough games
[1:23:13] Burr11: Maybe try to take advantage of the temporary invulnerability
[1:23:14] JackJaguar_: if you look closely, you can see a little smiley face on the checkpoint screen :)
[1:23:26] Senoquese: ashton51Woo barnuh nuuh nuh barnuh nu nuh nuuh
[1:23:29] Kitkattack: yeah there's world clocks to certain spawns
[1:23:46] Navy_Mongoose: that was US Box Art Mega Man
[1:23:58] Senoquese: ashton51Wibble
[1:24:01] yojamjam: air man's second in command, the dreaded fan boy
[1:24:03] Burr11: The fan killed you
[1:24:07] Burr11: ashton51Despair
[1:24:08] JackJaguar_: you almost beat the level!
[1:24:12] Navy_Mongoose: almost at the boss
[1:24:13] anonsama9001: almost to airman actually
[1:24:24] Redamaford: Those guys are called FAN FIENDS
[1:24:30] JackJaguar_: not a huge fan of this level, eh?
[1:24:38] Kitkattack: ashton51Hehe no way a fan could ever sabotage her
[1:24:45] Senoquese: she fan of my fiend til i
[1:25:31] Navy_Mongoose: not a fang  of this cloud part tbh, but I HATE Crash Man's stage
[1:25:55] ForgottenBud: Enemies will always respawn in the same spot once you trigger it. so you could move slightly back and forth and infinitely trigger respawns. It's a trick to farm free lives.
[1:25:59] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:26:00] JackJaguar_: Ash was ready for the boss rush
[1:26:01] hopsity: Could you imagine? LUL
[1:26:05] Burr11: Nooooo lost the health
[1:26:15] JaAmfan: for me quickman stage always gets me, I straight cant do it without the item
[1:26:15] Navy_Mongoose: Mega Man is a robot designed to learn good from bad
[1:26:17] ZippiBelfast: Wow really. You've never played a megaman before?

[1:26:23] hopsity: if you like rpgs you should try battle network sometime.
[1:27:01] Burr11: Lmao
[1:27:13] JaAmfan: battle network is SO freaking fun.
[1:27:15] teapot_bloodbath: mario looks weird today
[1:27:27] JackJaguar_: You'd probably really like Battle Network
[1:27:32] hopsity: closer :)
[1:27:35] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it is
[1:27:35] JackJaguar_: it's an action RPG
[1:27:37] Burr11: First actual death vs just falling
[1:27:42] ZippiBelfast: This is a platformer
[1:27:45] hopsity: battle network is much different from these.
[1:27:50] caratecaa: this is an action platformer yeah
[1:27:53] demon_dandy: No the other games are the rpgs, i think youd love em
[1:27:54] JaAmfan: battle network is an rpg but you dodge in real time and build your card deck
[1:27:57] Senoquese: !death
[1:27:58] AshtonMarten: Dean has died 0 times
[1:28:01] Kitkattack: battle network is a very difficult game to describe
[1:28:04] Navy_Mongoose: Battle Network is a VERY unique action RPG
[1:28:05] demon_dandy: Dean??
[1:28:07] Senoquese: who is dean
[1:28:08] Senoquese: LOL
[1:28:12] NunyaBizniz: this part made me ragequit as a kid for sure
[1:28:19] caratecaa: battle network is a deckbuilder rpg
[1:28:25] Kitkattack: omg seno has a new pet name
[1:28:30] Kitkattack: mf DEAN
[1:28:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yes
[1:28:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: this is hard even if you know what you are doing
[1:28:45] Burr11: Yep
[1:28:45] JackJaguar_: I mean this stage isn't so bad if you know what to expect
[1:28:48] demon_dandy: Ill count your deaths on my fingers ashton, surely thatll be fine ashton51Baby
[1:28:48] Senoquese: @Kitkattack the only pet name she has for is lil gay boy ashton51Despair
[1:28:52] Senoquese: for me*
[1:28:54] anonsama9001: yeah i;d say  this is one of the harder ones
[1:28:55] JackJaguar_: for beginners I'd say its a little rough

[2:31:27] Navy_Mongoose: oh nonono
[2:31:36] Navy_Mongoose: don't do it
[2:31:37] triyang: Or even earlier they were based on arcade games meant to milk quarters out of people
[2:31:38] ReyJaggy: Would not going to get better items from other bosses be the equivalent of a souls like game where you don't try to level up or upgrade your weapon while dying dozens of times to a boss
[2:31:40] JaAmfan: these games also came out like once a year for awhile
[2:31:41] ReyJaggy: 0.

[2:34:38] ForgottenBud: Don't even get me started on any of those Barbie games for the NES. My younger sister would cry to my parents to make me play the game for her while she watched.

[2:59:04] demon_dandy: Yeah but imagine doing that without item 2
[2:59:11] Navy_Mongoose: unfortunately no description, but item 1 is a floating platform
[2:59:19] JaAmfan: time to get the best weapon in the whole game
[2:59:20] JackJaguar_: yeah I think you would've rage quit that stage without Item 2
[2:59:26] Navy_Mongoose: !dance

[2:59:36] benito_mescalini: E
[2:59:37] Navy_Mongoose: E can, filled with Mountain Dew
[2:59:40] ImChileanNow: E
[3:00:01] JackJaguar_: be careful though, you lose all your E-Tanks on a gameover
[3:00:03] ImChileanNow: but thats the beauty of it, you have great platforming with sadistic enemy placement beribugHappiANC
[3:00:06] demon_dandy: Clueless
[3:00:06] Navy_Mongoose: no, gotta go under
[3:00:07] BooDooPerson: good thought, though
[3:00:19] ImChileanNow: it refills your health when you use it

[3:00:22] Navy_Mongoose: E Can gives you full health
[3:00:30] JackJaguar_: you can charge Atomic Fire
[3:00:37] ForgottenBud: I think you can shoot the chains to destroy those things
[3:00:38] yojamjam: ashton51OGEY
[3:00:38] benito_mescalini: Some programmer put that in "thought you were smarth, huh?"
[3:00:51] JackJaguar_: Ash, are you trying to do a ceiling clip? getting bold I see!
[3:00:53] Navy_Mongoose: it's like a Humanity, it's just like Dark Souls
[3:00:57] ReyJaggy: i frame it
[3:01:14] jodehummel: surely
[3:01:15] JackJaguar_: oh yeah, speedrunners use Item 1 to clip into the roof and break stages

[3:01:51] hopsity: I like this song :)
[3:01:56] Navy_Mongoose: you can farm 1ups off these drills
[3:01:57] BooDooPerson: this game should not be possible on NES. they had to do all kinds of tricks
[3:02:15] demon_dandy: Lets goooooo ashton51Tensai

[3:03:13] jodehummel: Ashton has such a positive energy <3
[3:03:13] Navy_Mongoose: many consider Metal Man to be the 1st stage
[3:03:23] Navy_Mongoose: you can use Item 1 to reach that
[3:03:25] hopsity: using an item you can :)
[3:03:47] JaAmfan: they're a barrel of fun
[3:03:50] JackJaguar_: this is honestly a pretty good stage for beginners
[3:03:56] Navy_Mongoose: shoot the gear
[3:04:00] hopsity: the items are actually used as glitches to warp around the stage in speedruns
[3:04:19] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[3:04:24] JackJaguar_: you should absolutely watch the TAS for this
[3:04:29] ForgottenBud: Yeah, there's a boss order that can make everything super easy, but where's the fun in that?
[3:04:55] JackJaguar_: poke him in the eyes
[3:05:10] JaAmfan: she's cracked
[3:05:17] Navy_Mongoose: drink  and E can

[3:06:35] JackJaguar_: I said this stage was beginner friendly
[3:06:35] jodehummel: peepo
[3:06:38] Navy_Mongoose: HE WILL ROCK YOUR SHIT WITH CHAINSAW BLADES
[3:06:40] jodehummel: peepoClap
[3:06:43] Navy_Mongoose: THE HARDEST BOSS IN THE GAME
[3:06:48] JackJaguar_: not bad logic
[3:06:56] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:07:06] JackJaguar_: he reacts to when you shoot
[3:07:13] BooDooPerson: ez stage, hard boss
[3:07:19] JackJaguar_: ^
[3:07:31] Navy_Mongoose: seriously just P gun and mash jump and shoot
[3:07:37] JackJaguar_: it does nothing
[3:07:39] Navy_Mongoose: I think he's immune to air
[3:07:40] BooDooPerson: immune to air I think
[3:07:40] ForgottenBud: he's immune to air man
[3:07:48] demon_dandy: It pangin off him
[3:08:06] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[3:08:09] Navy_Mongoose: keep jumping and shooting
[3:08:25] hopsity: he is a bit tough, but the best attack against him is your original.
[3:08:25] JackJaguar_: good thing you get 2 E-Tanks in this stage
[3:08:28] jodehummel: level easy, he is hard
[3:08:42] Navy_Mongoose: metal man is the easiest though
[3:08:57] Navy_Mongoose: this is metal man
[3:08:59] JackJaguar_: well, Flash Man's weapon can help you at the beginning here
[3:09:04] Navy_Mongoose: NES limitations
[3:09:06] BooDooPerson: can only have so many active sprites at once
[3:09:07] JackJaguar_: sprite limih!
[3:09:10] demon_dandy: Hes scared
[3:09:12] SygmaSteve: do you have Rush Jet
[3:09:12] BooDooPerson: they swap them frame by frame
[3:09:23] jodehummel: NES can only show so many sprites
[3:09:25] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[3:09:27] Navy_Mongoose: you spent your whole health bar using a useless weapon though
[3:09:29] hopsity: metal man is the one people start with often.
[3:09:29] JackJaguar_: LOL\
[3:09:34] JaAmfan: megaman is like riding a bike. when you fall into a pit you die
[3:09:38] ForgottenBud: it's cause the old games where pushed to the limit and they kept it in all the remakes
[3:09:50] JackJaguar_: she's learning!
[3:10:00] demon_dandy: Yeah shes experimenting ashton51Tehe
[3:10:00] BooDooPerson: fire to melt metal totally makes sense, but the designers don't agree
[3:10:12] Navy_Mongoose: yes, item 1 for a 1up is worth it
[3:10:13] BooDooPerson: air to break metal....not as much. But you gotta try.
[3:10:13] JackJaguar_: Atomic Fire does decent damage, but it takes forever to fully charge AND a full charge takes 10 units of energy
[3:10:32] jodehummel: yeah, it's beautiful to watch her improving skills
[3:10:34] JaAmfan: its all about trial and error
[3:10:34] BooDooPerson: hey you gotta try! I get it!
[3:11:11] JackJaguar_: classic Mega Man enemies are silly

[3:11:34] Navy_Mongoose: you can shoot those can towers too
[3:11:34] BooDooPerson: nice
[3:11:42] JackJaguar_: hitboxes!
[3:11:46] SygmaSteve: @jacksjagstv they're deadly murder bots
[3:11:54] JackJaguar_: but they're cute and silly!
[3:12:01] demon_dandy: This dude always remind me of the bill that sings
[3:12:07] TheAsterite: i think you can poke those guys in the eyes
[3:12:18] JackJaguar_: see? fast stage!
[3:12:27] Navy_Mongoose: Heat Man requires you to charge the shot
[3:12:34] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[3:12:37] hopsity: the wiggly tube dudes.
[3:12:45] TheAsterite: the stacked guys
[3:12:47] BooDooPerson: your peashooter is fine you got this
[3:12:50] Navy_Mongoose: otherwise its baby damage
[3:13:00] JackJaguar_: Normal Man

[3:13:47] funnyplanet1: ?
[3:13:47] JaAmfan: metalman vanquished
[3:13:50] ForgottenBud: Cheer100
[3:14:03] JaAmfan: game is over, thats the best weapon
[3:14:04] Navy_Mongoose: real peetzuh from mizzoo
[3:14:23] Navy_Mongoose: equip metal blade and win the game
[3:14:24] MrPeachie: metalman is the goat
[3:14:26] demon_dandy: I will say unless she asks, no need for all the helpful hints ashton51Tehe
[3:14:27] rikkaonline: ashton51Stare
[3:14:27] JackJaguar_: you won
[3:14:29] JaAmfan: come onnnnn
[3:14:38] hopsity: this is my favorite song!
[3:14:43] JackJaguar_: ok we lied, the best weapon is Bubble
[3:14:58] DwarvenCrusader: no
[3:15:00] DwarvenCrusader: this is Wood Man
[3:15:00] Navy_Mongoose: 8 boss weapons and 3 items
[3:15:00] JackJaguar_: no
[3:15:21] demon_dandy: Ohh i hear what youre sayin
[3:15:21] JaAmfan: :]
[3:15:26] Navy_Mongoose: Wood Man is in that song, because he wants the Wood weapon to fight Air Man
[3:15:27] the_ol_regular: It shoots up!!!
[3:15:27] JackJaguar_: Ashton, you have 112 uses of Metal Blade before running out
[3:15:34] the_ol_regular: snailleFlush snailleFlush snailleFlush snailleFlush
[3:15:35] JackJaguar_: 112 USES
[3:15:40] DwarvenCrusader: 8 directions and it depletes one tiny bar after four shots
[3:15:47] BooDooPerson: damn that's so many uses
[3:15:51] JackJaguar_: it does refill
[3:15:55] the_ol_regular: Capcom would make you pay 5 dollars to refill the metal blades
[3:16:02] Navy_Mongoose: that rusty looking bar is your ammo, it can be used ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE TIMES before empty
[3:16:07] JackJaguar_: you're nearing the checkpoint
[3:16:13] JaAmfan: nah
[3:16:18] MrPeachie: yes

[3:16:41] jodehummel: KEKW
[3:16:42] JackJaguar_: deleted
[3:16:45] ReyJaggy: 112 is such an specific number
[3:16:51] JackJaguar_: 8 whole directions
[3:17:02] JaAmfan: wait saying a weapon is good is backseating but this aint ashton51Pathetic
[3:17:08] ReyJaggy: ashton51OGEY
[3:17:12] JackJaguar_: because ONE Metal Blade is 1/4 of 1 unit
[3:17:20] Navy_Mongoose: its the cheapest weapon that many, many enemies are weak to
[3:17:26] JackJaguar_: so 4  Metal Blades = 1 unit
[3:17:44] JaAmfan: me too its good
[3:17:44] JackJaguar_: you have 28 HP and Weapon Energy
[3:17:51] StreamElements: Get your scrungly Ashton Plushten before they're gone! https://studionekomata.com/collections/ashton-marten
[3:17:55] BooDooPerson: true
[3:18:05] Navy_Mongoose: you can kill him with p-gun
[3:18:06] demon_dandy: I think telling her boss strats is like too much backseatin is what i was thinkin about
[3:18:27] JaAmfan: thats probably good
[3:18:34] Navy_Mongoose: if you use only p-gun those fire dogs are the hardest part of this level
[3:18:37] ZippiBelfast: Backseating baaaaaaaad
[3:18:47] JackJaguar_: it's a Monking!
[3:18:53] demon_dandy: Ill say navy youre goin extremely hard
[3:19:17] ReyJaggy: monke just wants hug

[3:19:33] Navy_Mongoose: bunneh
[3:19:33] JackJaguar_: Rabbot!
[3:20:02] ZippiBelfast: I think most people start with Metal man
[3:20:03] demon_dandy: classic
[3:20:04] JackJaguar_: you're going out of order, but you're getting useful weapons
[3:20:06] Navy_Mongoose: not really, air man is useless against heat man
[3:20:12] JaAmfan: its a very well designed game so there's a bunch of different ways to go about it
[3:20:15] Navy_Mongoose: uppies
[3:20:21] JackJaguar_: this game has many many many ways to be beaten
[3:20:21] jodehummel: Doing the proper order is lame
[3:20:25] ReyJaggy: !Dance

[4:18:03] hopsity: By the way ashton, if I may recommend, try out megaman powered up if you want to try out megaman 1. It is a much different style but still fun :)
[4:18:18] Funchucks: he does have projectiles, he just tends to die before you see them

[4:21:28] Xizzzy_2nd: might not be a bad idea to look into methods to stretch your thumbs I'm sure they exist
[4:21:33] pagrodebraska: double jointed in the thumb is the worst so count yourself lucky, it add a lot of pain while gripping things
[4:21:36] cleightonfrancis2: you don't have extra buttons on your keyboard ewwww
[4:21:37] avfusion: my right thumb is my dominant one for thumb-related keyboard things, so it tracks

[4:44:01] Funchucks: like Sanic, he's gotta go fast
[4:44:31] Xizzzy_2nd: the funnier quirk is how you need the weakness to get through the level
[4:44:53] Funchucks: you don't need it, but it does make it a lot easier
[4:45:08] Navy_Mongoose: nope, still beatable without any powers
[4:45:12] demon_dandy: Its possible ashton51Tehe
