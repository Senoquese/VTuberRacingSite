[2:20:04] SolAzul42: :)
[2:20:22] RobotFaker: Yesss the shifty look mappy series

[2:28:56] Senoquese: LOL
[2:30:00] dynamozx05: retro games are just a feeling, even the really bad ones
[2:30:05] niertlwal: there was no standard and no sanity, young indiana jones games come to mind
[2:30:13] Xizzzy_2nd: I think it should return to the "no standard" so we get quirky games
[2:30:19] Senoquese: its always so crazy seeing jsr and future defenders in chat while i think how you felt playing
[2:30:59] 99d9: the absence of a staple feature can make new ways of thinking or strategies emerge
[2:31:11] Choclad: I used to study game design in a very brief era of my life, and one of the big things they taught us about was this era of gaming and the invention of the term "shovelware" in relation to games
[2:31:24] Choclad: The early video gaming bubble
[2:32:00] Xizzzy_2nd: they also put a ton of effort into things like graphics
[2:32:02] Choclad: But there is something sort of quaint about them sinuuNodders
[2:32:11] dynamozx05: the sole idea of a Namco Comic Universe is hilarious to me just because we could get Mappy to meet Kosmos from Xenosaga
[2:32:14] Senoquese: i have such a sweet spot for hilariously bad shovelware
[2:32:15] RobotFaker: goodbye mappy ashton51Wave ashton51Wave ashton51Wave
[2:32:26] SolAzul42: ET lol
[2:32:29] Xizzzy_2nd: so these old games have insanely good music because if you've only got room for one loop it better be good
[2:32:42] JTBun: yes
[2:32:43] Senoquese: yes
[2:32:51] Choclad: ET is the famous one, for sure
[2:32:57] Senoquese: im not sure if its shovelware tho, it just went horribly wrong in terms of budget and pressure
[2:33:08] SolAzul42: The 2600 had no licensing program so tons of shovelware
[2:33:13] JTBun: ET literally was so much shovelware that is tanked the game industy
[2:33:19] SolAzul42: The original pac man for 2600 was bad too
[2:33:21] kirak1r4_: is this the game with the creepypasta board?
[2:33:30] 99d9: 190 mph shindigsRealized
[2:33:35] olandgren: she‚Äôs gaming!
[2:33:39] Xizzzy_2nd: if you want a rare racing game play "Rock n roll racing"
[2:33:46] InsaneLoke: this is the game you play in the restaurant
[2:33:52] TokaiNanase: I'd say Pac Man for Atari was 1st shovelware. It's just less famous then ET.
[2:34:02] RobotFaker: you ever see that atari commerical for the port of this game where a guy screams at a family about playing pole position
[2:34:05] Choclad: I really enjoy the bugs that would come up in these games - the systems they were using were so rudimentary so they had to do all this stuff for performance that opened up space for super weird bugs
[2:34:06] insp_gadget: not the first, but it was the most famous flop. because they made it very fast and very broken with no explanation on how to play it.
[2:34:15] 99d9: i miss restaurants and just normal places having one arcade game :(
[2:34:21] kirak1r4_: nvm it was california speed lol
[2:34:53] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke this is very wrong jtb paid for a game tablet pass in a restaurant we went to on a date and it only gave us like marvel subway surfers
[2:35:02] Choclad: Also they didn't have software version control in the same way as we do now so there were bugs that just came from working on a team without quality measures
[2:35:08] Senoquese: AYAYA
[2:35:16] JackJaguar_: pole position!!
[2:35:30] SolAzul42: To be fair though back then it was like one or two guys working on the games

[2:39:41] TokaiNanase: btw! The track in this game. It's actually real. It's called Fuji Speedway. While it's layout changed in the 00s, this version of it appeared in Gran Turismo 4 .
[2:39:41] 99d9: thats stuff we take for granted now
[2:40:14] RobotFaker: I think some racing games have a thing with drifting by changing gears
[2:40:17] Senoquese: i remember finding this cabinet in person with jtb and thinking wow oshi moment!!! then i spent our last coin and immediately lost because i didnt know there was a physical pedal
[2:40:22] RobotFaker: or at least daytona usa
[2:40:34] JackJaguar_: rollling staaartttt
[2:40:36] RobotFaker: I see I see
[2:41:05] JTBun: @Senoquese LMAO yeah, that place was really cool tho
[2:41:13] TokaiNanase: IRL racing, you use different gears depending on different corners, but no idea how that would translate to a game like this.

[3:33:10] Ichorum: meatsREMBER
[3:33:14] Ichorum: No
[3:33:19] rikkaonline: imo what makes pod racer seem bad is a lot of screens dont have bgm so it feels kind of empty sometimes
[3:33:19] ReyJaggy: lmao
[3:33:22] Ichorum: mintyc14Rember
[3:33:30] InsaneLoke: jax and dakter
[3:33:36] rikkaonline: it does get tough
[3:33:42] Senoquese: there were a bunchhhh of star wars games so you could be mixing some up
[3:33:43] SolAzul42: The frame rate is atrocious
[3:33:46] rikkaonline: one of the few games i fully beat though

[3:36:06] SolAzul42: At that point you could just build a new one from scratch
[3:36:10] phatscout: iirc this thing isn't actually an emulator, all the games on this thing are actually rewrites of the originals to whatever sunplus chip this thing uses
[3:36:11] rikkaonline: like that seinfeld episode
[3:36:15] Tradgore2: feels like it's a lost art of gaming; they really dont make plug n play anymore
[3:36:18] TachikomaKURO: Oh
