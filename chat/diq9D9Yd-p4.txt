[0:32:57] Senoquese: irl physics bug
[0:33:03] Aefen: the wet makes everything slippery so you go faster
[0:33:09] Navy_Mongoose: maybe it's an illusion caused by you actually feeling the speed through the raindrops instead of air?
[0:33:14] peachuuuu: are you sure it’s not just that the rain is close to you so you can “see” the speed you know
[0:33:44] ahzree: ashton51Hi
[0:34:03] Aefen: yeah it's like needles

[0:47:56] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy
[0:48:07] PSYCOMMUnist: here comes the ragebait
[0:48:09] ScarletRook: here comes a thought
[0:48:10] Aefen: what
[0:48:10] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Yes
[0:48:11] Senoquese: what
[0:48:12] yojamjam: no there's rng
[0:48:12] GolfTermBirdie: what does that mean
[0:48:12] pogotross: no because randomness?
[0:48:13] InsaneLoke: wym
[0:48:14] bonatide: yeah
[0:48:14] deafmutelaughing: like melee?
[0:48:18] demon_dandy: Nah cause its prediction
[0:48:20] rodetovenaar: How so?
[0:48:21] Navy_Mongoose: huh? what do you mean?
[0:48:21] ajvark: i think there are papers
[0:48:22] TheAsterite: you mean like a perfect game?
[0:48:22] rodetovenaar: Yeah
[0:48:23] pogotross: so much rng
[0:48:25] DavidPortnov: It's... a thought.
[0:48:25] Senoquese: what do you mean solved
[0:48:26] rodetovenaar: Crits
[0:48:27] GolfTermBirdie: isn't it rock paper scissors
[0:48:29] rodetovenaar: Damage is a roll
[0:48:30] bonatide: isnt arceus literally like their god
[0:48:33] InsaneLoke: what does that mean
[0:48:35] F1nalStarman: Aren't there way too many variables involved to solve it?
[0:48:35] pantalaimon91: There's RNG but you can set the seed if you want
[0:48:35] rodetovenaar: Chances for statuses to end
[0:48:36] mareeples: Kind-of, but not in a way you can easily express it.
[0:48:37] Navy_Mongoose: also yeas, RNG is inevitable because there is a 1/256 chance for every single move to fail
[0:48:38] JTBun: you cam manipulate RNG
[0:48:43] Envivii: u mean like the best team you could make to beat the game? probably
[0:48:45] Senoquese: dont most games have a meta
[0:48:47] pogotross: like tic-tac-toe and connect four are solved
[0:48:48] ScarletRook: No because crits and status effects change things
[0:48:51] GolfTermBirdie: thats meta no??
[0:48:53] InsaneLoke: theres chance
[0:48:55] GolfTermBirdie: thats not math though
[0:48:56] bonatide: the bait worked
[0:48:57] PSYCOMMUnist: no even RBY Ubers has lots of variation and counterplay
[0:48:58] rodetovenaar: Nope
[0:48:58] demon_dandy: There are optimal builds tbf
[0:48:58] Senoquese: thats just meta
[0:48:58] Aefen: oh yeah because there's rng involved
[0:48:58] TheAsterite: is it possible to make a perfect team? there will always be holes right?
[0:49:00] pantalaimon91: So you mean Meta? If so then basically yes
[0:49:00] Envivii: i think that's what speedrunners do
[0:49:05] Navy_Mongoose: Kind of, but Gen1 was broken as fuck
[0:49:10] DavidPortnov: That just sounds like a meta?
[0:49:18] omega191817: but then there is the counter meta
[0:49:20] peachuuuu: theres optimal stuff but no it’s not solved like chess can be theoretically
[0:49:22] Aefen: if two people had the same team, you couldn't predict who'd win because of the rng
[0:49:23] Navy_Mongoose: every Gen 1 team had Tauros/Persian/Snorlax
[0:49:25] InsaneLoke: well thats the fun of the game
[0:49:25] Senoquese: thats not just pokemon tho thats any game that has stronger items/characters/etc
[0:49:27] mareeples: Run and Bun is the "hardest" right now and you use a calculator to play it. There's no one optimal, but it is deterministic in many cases.
[0:49:32] F1nalStarman: Yeah meta and mathematically "solving" a game are completely different things
[0:49:34] yojamjam: there may be a consensus best team but it may end up with fringe counters, plus move choices and switches there are too many inflection points to be fully optimal
[0:49:34] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:49:36] TheAsterite: also in a tournament you have to last many rounds
[0:49:37] PSYCOMMUnist: no because there's a lot of different versions of the perfect teams
[0:49:41] Aefen: LMAO
[0:49:49] rodetovenaar: Yeah, there's tons of RNG
[0:49:52] GolfTermBirdie: square the power of your starter and subtract the median level of the enemy team and youll get amount of turns until absolute victory
[0:49:53] pogotross: they had to ban moves that made the RNG worse
[0:49:55] bonatide: shes apologizing already keroke12Point
[0:49:57] killerscorp942: Would depend on the format. There's always pokemon that can counter the top ones, and even having one different move can be a big diff
[0:50:02] demon_dandy: We should check in on the vtuber tourney just to see LOL
[0:50:05] DavidPortnov: This is why I don't play these kinds of games competitively.
[0:50:20] Envivii: there's also bans, in competitive, cuz some mons really would just steamroll everything
[0:50:29] Aefen: calculating every move ahead of time
[0:50:40] Navy_Mongoose: just play any pokemon game and pick a team you like, it'll be fine
[0:50:40] Senoquese: why pokemon specifically or was it just the random game that you happened to be thinking of
[0:50:41] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:50:42] PSYCOMMUnist: I mean there are things you MUST do in RBY like bring Mewtwo so you're not totally wrong
[0:50:44] GolfTermBirdie: wait wait
[0:50:44] rodetovenaar: HELL YEAH
[0:50:44] pantalaimon91: LOL
[0:50:46] JTBun: what
[0:50:48] rodetovenaar: Let's talk about it
[0:50:53] DavidPortnov: ...
[0:50:55] Senoquese: ???
[0:50:56] bonatide: medusa is her new boo radley
[0:50:57] yojamjam: actually yeah this is better than pokemon
[0:50:58] Threepeat3PT: i just tuned in for the first time
[0:51:00] PSYCOMMUnist: You're not completely off it's just not set in stone
[0:51:00] Red__2: yeah that may be just you
[0:51:01] TheAsterite: that's why i liked playing mtg in the past. you could have a meta deck, but depending on tournament pairings you could be up against a deck good against yours
[0:51:09] DavidPortnov: @Threepeat3PT Good luck!

[3:06:02] peachuuuu: anime fan media literacy is at rock bottom man
[3:06:09] mage_mw: solo levelling cities

[3:07:14] spikebomb5: it's ppl still stuck in middle school mindset, no difference
[3:07:16] DavidPortnov: Y'all are on social media so often.
[3:07:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: my rule is any anime protag made post 2000's are weaker than pre 2000s because everyone just out here making new super people with no reasoning
[3:07:42] peachuuuu: @InsaneLoke maybe 2.5 is a better answer
[3:07:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: EXCEPT LUFFY. i respect that mans

[3:08:32] peachuuuu: its 2025 and people still powerscale superman and goku if you can believe it
[3:08:34] a_raccoon27: theyd never have the balls to kill of chainsaw man in chainsaw man

[3:08:59] spikebomb5: it's like when ppl take one punch man seriously

[3:09:05] mage_mw: its like wrestling talk but anime
[3:09:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @peachuuuu i love how dumb that is because neither would fight.

[3:09:52] a_raccoon27: @mrp0p1nfr3sh I thought goku's whole thing was that he loved to fight?
[3:10:14] pogotross: @a_raccoon27 he wouldn't want to KILL superman, but he sure as heck would want to fight him
[3:10:29] InsaneLoke: oh no ashton, now they really are discussing shonen battle anime
[3:10:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @a_raccoon27 goku wants to be the strongest and tested to be the strongest but they are both heros and they dont just randomy jump people
