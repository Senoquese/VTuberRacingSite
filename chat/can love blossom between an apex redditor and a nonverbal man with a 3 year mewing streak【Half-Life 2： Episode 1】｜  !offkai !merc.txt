[3:40:20] LapDanceDietrich: Bgm!
[3:40:26] Senoquese: and they never figured out how to do it
[3:40:33] Burr11: ashton51Love
[3:40:34] demon_dandy: erm ashton! ☝😅 mayhaps you forgot the bgm
[3:40:34] raiifrost: It's BECAUSE you're a professional that we don't let you drive
[3:40:34] Bookethead: hl3 will probably be VR only just like alyx
[3:40:42] LapDanceDietrich: peggyxYippee
[3:40:43] JTBun: yeah and Alyx was groundbreaking for VR
[3:40:51] Navy_Mongoose: HL3 NEEDS simulated hand-holding with Barney
[3:40:56] niertlwal: idk ifs they never figured it out
[3:40:59] Senoquese: they dont count VR as a main platform, hence why it only gets spinoffs
[3:41:00] niertlwal: maybe they just didn't wanna do it
[3:41:04] DatBoiVLC: 3 will be groundbreaking for controller that kills you IRL when you die in-game
[3:41:07] niertlwal: laidlaw is out anyway
[3:41:08] Senoquese: alyx only had like 5% of the playerbase
[3:41:12] niertlwal: he's no longer at valve iirc
[3:41:23] LapDanceDietrich: HL3 is SAO
[3:41:25] demon_dandy: Yeah i dunno if they could live up to the hype but i doubt theyd need to
[3:41:27] vectri: now he makes videos on youtube
[3:41:32] Burr11: valve's structure is also just weird, like everyone just works on whatever they want, so it has to be cool enough to get support and be fully developed
[3:41:34] Navy_Mongoose: because that requires me to invest in a VR headset which I am too poor to afford
[3:41:36] Bookethead: @Senoquese I think the idea was to popularize VR beyond that, but the price to enter is way too high
[3:41:39] niertlwal: he wrote some books which are hl3 "sorta"
[3:41:39] Senoquese: half life can still carry on without a writer
[3:41:50] Senoquese: valve can hire anyone to write for them
[3:42:17] DatBoiVLC: Only at the end of Half Life: Full Life Consequences
[3:42:19] JTBun: valve wouldn't hire a trash writer
[3:42:25] Senoquese: theyd never release a new game if it didnt have amazing writing
[3:42:27] niertlwal: he writes something with regards that builds off of the portal 1/2 lore that crosses over with hl lore
[3:42:32] Senoquese: if they settled for subpar hl3 would have released already
[3:42:33] Navy_Mongoose: Half Life Full Life Consequences is the real HL3
[3:42:33] demon_dandy: Damn awwww ashton51Wibble
[3:42:35] niertlwal: i would definitely play portal 1 & 2
[3:42:40] niertlwal: since it does feed into it a bit
[3:42:48] Bookethead: all of valve's hardware bets have been pretty terrible up until the steamdeck, the steam box, steam controller, steam link, and to an extent their VR headsets
[3:42:58] raiifrost: HOW COULD YOU NYEH
[3:43:00] demon_dandy: Yeah at least theyre okay
[3:43:24] Senoquese: theyve basically settled on this mindset that if hl3 releases, it needs to make every single half life fan happy
[3:43:30] Senoquese: and obviously thats really toxic and means itll never release
[3:43:32] JTBun: IDK, you would have to see the cliffhanger to understand
[3:43:35] beefdrizzle: slapdash?
[3:43:35] DatBoiVLC: Yes, no ending is better than a bad ending ashton51Baby
[3:43:36] TheAsterite: valve can't count to 3 tho
[3:43:36] Navy_Mongoose: slapped together
[3:43:38] niertlwal: steam deck is only because there was such a dearth of gaming on linux
[3:43:42] ZippiBelfast: "open for interpretation"
[3:43:48] barfchan: it's the most cliffhung i've been i think
[3:43:51] Burr11: i think even if they do HL3 and it has a real "ending" it'll still be open ended like every HL, because they always have to make it so the G-man can unfreeze Gordon again or something
[3:44:04] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[3:44:05] JTBun: it's a pretty huge cliffhanger
[3:44:06] beefdrizzle: it's p bad
[3:44:08] Senoquese: hl3 is a meme for a reason
[3:44:08] DatBoiVLC: If the story doesn't end that means the wonder doesn't end either CarlSmile
[3:44:12] Senoquese: EVERYONE wanted more
[3:44:17] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[3:44:22] Navy_Mongoose: 5 hours?
[3:44:24] Burr11: it's definitely one of the worst cliffhangers ever
[3:44:25] demon_dandy: Be careful LMAO
[3:44:32] Burr11: yeah dont spoil yourself
[3:44:37] TheAsterite: episode 3 is the best one tbh
[3:44:43] MrOshawott_RYAN: MrOshawott_RYAN watched 15 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Hello Ashton. ashton51Smile
[3:44:44] niertlwal: but again, even laidlaw says that episode 3 that he wrote was a mistake
[3:44:52] Senoquese: you can do it in a 6 hour stream if you dont yap much
[3:45:02] LapDanceDietrich: Valve should get the Muv-Luv Alternative writers for HL3 mhm mhm
[3:45:06] Burr11: it's just a script
[3:45:08] DatBoiVLC: The script for what would have been episode 3 leaked at one point
[3:45:10] niertlwal: no he wrote a script for it
[3:45:11] Navy_Mongoose: no, Ep3 was just the script
[3:45:14] Bookethead: he published some writings that seemed to be a conclusion for hl2
[3:45:15] Senoquese: laidlaw wrote the plot for episode 3 but he regretted it
[3:45:16] niertlwal: he regrets it
[3:45:38] niertlwal: mostly cause he feels more could've been fleshed out in the development
[3:45:43] demon_dandy: ashtons hotline miami stream ashton51Despair
[3:46:01] OGBT_Orion: I'm going to have to dig up the VOD from that: that was what I came from hahaha
[3:46:03] DatBoiVLC: SUPER HOT when?
[3:46:08] JTBun: hotline maiami my beloved
[3:46:08] beefdrizzle: hotline miami, oh
[3:46:11] demon_dandy: LMAO you did kinda brain numb on it
[3:46:12] niertlwal: it's not like he's banned, valve feels like one of those one-night stands or situationships
[3:46:13] ApocalypseSC: did you say you'd played the new prey?
[3:46:36] OGBT_Orion: Yeah! I was derusting the Brandon speedrun and then I played through Parts 1-4 with Don Juan for giggles.
[3:46:38] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: superhot vr
[3:46:44] Navy_Mongoose: I just wanted to say I think your chilla mouth looks cute
[3:46:45] Senoquese: half life is so important to valve and everyone involved that even he felt like that script he intentionally leaked could *still* be better, despite only doing it as "revenge"
[3:46:47] LapDanceDietrich: I have 100% Neon White oop
[3:46:48] demon_dandy: New prey is pretty cool ashton51Baby
