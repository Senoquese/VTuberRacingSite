[2:56:24] kevx59: Heck even the initial d ops have different sounds even though most are by m.o.v.e.
[2:56:45] kazutheblep: I did not expect to hear eurobeat
[2:56:55] gravitypriest: david dima has like 100 different names but his voice is so distinct you can tlel
[2:57:03] mushi_buns: eurobeat is a weird genre where everyone has like 3 diffrent names its weird
[2:57:05] gravitypriest: same w/ de jorio
[2:57:11] ReyJaggy: race queen = EUROBEAT
[2:57:19] kazutheblep: Dave Rodgers

[2:57:39] DarkMatt717: greetings
[2:58:07] kazutheblep: the Rodgers dude has so many aliases that it's hard to tell which song is which
[2:58:13] gravitypriest: like this is Ace, but he also uses the names Van TK, Paul Harris, etc
[2:58:13] DarkMatt717: I played a bunch of tetris and I think I played too much because I'm feeling complicated right now.
[2:58:23] gravitypriest: @kazutheblep and he shares them with other singers lol
[2:58:29] gravitypriest: like Aleph and Derrick Simons
[2:58:34] DarkMatt717: so I'm glad to have eurobeat right now
[2:58:37] kazutheblep: right???
[2:58:46] kazutheblep: "WHO ARE YOOOOU, DAVE RODGEEERS"
[2:59:00] gravitypriest: it's okay his voice is so distinct it's easy to tell
[2:59:15] mushi_buns: Dave pretty easy to spot ya lol
[2:59:29] gravitypriest: now I want to drive
[2:59:34] gravitypriest: ashton51Steer
[2:59:38] gravitypriest: no this is Ace
[2:59:57] mushi_buns: it gos back to the dico tec I think
[3:00:00] gravitypriest: i don't think it actually is, all this music is made for the japanese market
[3:00:00] kazutheblep: ^
[3:00:02] DarkMatt717: you know I am curious what caused eurobeat
[3:00:15] naoyukiogura: Initial D lmao
[3:00:18] DarkMatt717: is it just japanese racing? Because that's honestly a little disappointing
[3:00:26] demon_dandy: Everyone owned a ferrari naturally
[3:00:47] gravitypriest: there were a lot of clubs in the 90s that played eurobeat and avex funded initial D iirc so they used that as the bgm
[3:00:49] mushi_buns: IniD had driving to eurobeat, but before it was popular with Para Para in japan
[3:00:53] kevx59: Dave also has a eurobeat cover of the mariah carey christmas song that unironically slaps.
[3:01:15] naoyukiogura: @kevx59 how to make ze Mariah Carey song tolerable
[3:01:25] demon_dandy: Lmao i love the eurobeat christmas songs
[3:01:49] DarkMatt717: okay I pulled up wikipedia on eurobeat. It told me there are two subgenres for eurobeat. Neither of them talk about initial D or japan
[3:01:56] DarkMatt717: I think I'm being trolled by wikipedia
[3:01:56] gravitypriest: the maharaja in roppongi was a big one which is why there is a lot of songs themed around it
