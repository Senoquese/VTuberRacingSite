[1:32:45] kuma_4ever: Union VA struck a deal do we will see
[1:32:47] Senoquese: they basically admitted they dont care about game vas and are exclusively focusing on movies and series
[1:32:55] Burr11: persona 5 is better gameplay wise mostly
[1:32:58] PSYCOMMUnist: They're all amazing games and I think it just comes down to what resonates with you most
[1:33:02] olandgren: fewer problematic elements and better gameplay
[1:33:04] Kitkattack: best gameplay but honestly the story of the 3 and 4 stayed with me a lot more
[1:33:06] TheMoatman: IDK if Persona 5 will be better with modern qol updates to 4
[1:33:25] Burr11: story wise there's some things 5 does better but other things 3 and 4 do better.. it's a mixed bag
[1:33:32] JoeyG828: I'm open to a hearing new voices, but the nostalgia of the old voices will be missed.
[1:33:45] Senoquese: every persona 5 fan ive seen used to LOVE 5 until they played 4
[1:33:47] JoeyG828: 15 YEARS BABY
[1:33:50] PSYCOMMUnist: Persona 3 4 5 is like FF7 9 10 etc. there's no need to worry about what's best
[1:33:53] Qrockpot: P4D > P5D
[1:33:57] olandgren: the homophobia didn’t age well
[1:34:19] Kitkattack: a whole character arc of Kanji

[1:34:27] DatBoiVLC: p5 rewrote their homophobia plotline lol
[1:34:27] PSYCOMMUnist: that's the character arc, that's the point
[1:34:29] Qrockpot: Theres a whole homophobia dungeon
[1:34:31] Burr11: lmao yeah the whole kanji thing is like that
[1:34:35] Kitkattack: girl what
[1:34:54] Senoquese: persona 5 has homophobia its me calling joker names
[1:34:55] Kitkattack: it was about a sauna and him checking out dudes

[1:37:10] Kitkattack: idk what's neccesarily problematic? kanji having qualms about coming out or recognizing that side is very modern no
[1:37:34] PSYCOMMUnist: yeah he is insecure and the point of persona is accepting yourself to move on
[1:37:36] JoeyG828: "But we was in slavery!"
[1:37:46] Envivii: Can we watch veggietales silly songs now lmao

[1:38:31] JoeyG828: A lot of media we had growing up was oddly homophobic. I watched a lot of Friends and that had a lot of homophobic stuff. :/
[1:38:43] Navy_Mongoose: Axel x Roxas isn't really problematic though?
[1:38:51] Senoquese: yeahh
[1:39:08] Kitkattack: aren't they like best friends? how would you know there was any kind of age gap
[1:39:16] Navy_Mongoose: Roxas is barely a year old, and Axel is at most 3
[1:39:22] Kitkattack: that's garbo

[5:07:09] Navy_Mongoose: well RE3 Nemesis was made less than a year after 2, because it wasn't originally supposed to be 3, just a spinoff
[5:07:15] 4zriot: Capcom recycling, this game wasn't even supposed to be marked RE3, it was more of a spinoff
