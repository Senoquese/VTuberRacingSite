[0:38:43] chinwillach: Ah yea that got taken outta context by RRATS to cause a shitstorm
[0:39:18] ReyJaggy: i think thats why that one hentai artist stopped working with hololive right?
[0:39:18] Kitkattack: wtf no way

[0:39:57] Burr11: lmao
[0:40:02] mrvacbob: no that guy was working on an official holo manga and just went nuts on his own
[0:40:11] Navy_Mongoose: there might be due to how strict copyright law in japan is
[0:40:17] Cannonaire: Copyright law in Japan is Draconian.
[0:40:17] Kitkattack: bl chilling in the fridge is prety hilarious
[0:40:19] kyle__senpai: Copyright law in the US is pretty nuts too
[0:40:33] rikkaonline: yeah pretty much
[0:40:33] Returner7: ok hang on, it's not like they're going to ship you off to Japan to get served right?!
[0:40:34] Burr11: they look the other way on doujins as long as they aren't profiting
[0:40:44] mrvacbob: copyright for BL doujin is weird, I think it's something like comiket itself has a copyright exception license
[0:40:44] Burr11: but they could go after it
[0:40:54] mrvacbob: and then anything else is illegal but they just don't care
[0:41:00] rikkaonline: japan is worse than us - they dont have any fair use at all, but we still have critque and parody
[0:41:02] TheAsterite: convention artist merch is like, all copyrighted stuff
[0:41:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Dojinshi's are a double edged sword. They dont wanna take them down cuz its more content for fans and keeps them in the focus.
[0:41:06] TheAsterite: ashton51Omega ashton51Omega ashton51Omega
[0:41:11] mrvacbob: and jp fans are careful not to make fan merch if there's similar official merch

[0:41:36] Kitkattack: not to far from the truth
[0:41:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Gundam got revived in the early 2000s cuz of doujinshis

[0:46:12] Moikoi: Understandable ashton51Omegalul
[0:46:19] Navy_Mongoose: kill la kill felt like it was written as they went, its quality takes sudden dips at the beginning and toward the end but has hype moments in other places

[3:34:12] Senoquese: are you an engineer like the guy from tf2 with the sentries
[3:34:25] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese now this is more my speed

[3:40:51] ReyJaggy: some holo artists also have engineer degrees and thats why they draw a lot of hololive not taking comms, because they make more money at their job
[3:40:55] InsaneLoke: i think office life just sucks lol
[3:40:55] rikkaonline: wfh is the best thing that ever happened to me

[3:44:03] InsaneLoke: yeah are already pretty relatable
[3:44:09] Senoquese: im a dumbass i cannot relate to a smart woman
[3:44:12] demon_dandy: I dont relate to dis nerd shit sorry...
[3:44:16] Kitkattack: you can only generalize so much about careers, tons of different companies and employees are probably way different
[3:44:17] Burr11: i'm kinda feeling midlife crisisy about my job lately.. getting annoyed with stuff and how political performance reviews are.. kind of want to do something more meaningful to me instead of pleasing others

[3:46:20] kyle__senpai: I'm finding peace now. Then I have work tomorrow morning.
[3:46:34] demon_dandy: Should we save these for doc marten takamu5Tkako
[3:46:41] fixedspectacles2014: I'm only using your advice. If things go wrong its your fault
[3:46:59] Burr11: lol thanks for the supportive comment in any case ashton51Love
[3:47:06] horribleham: Oh, more nerd stuff sorry, but I would say that my current place is more bearable because of a specific set up we don't answer to out of touch share holders. Watch out for public companies, all they care about is the profit.
[3:47:06] kyle__senpai: Thank you for the medical and legal advice, Ash!
