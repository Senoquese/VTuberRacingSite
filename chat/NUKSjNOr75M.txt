[3:32:10] KazooManEvan: its ok youre still cute ashton51Alien
[3:32:53] Bird_toe: @KazooManEvan theoretically it is when multiple people co-own the same property for vacationing and share it by timing when they go on vacation. In practice it gets twisted into a scam by the company managing the property.
[3:33:20] KazooManEvan: @Bird_toe  ashton51Noted
[3:33:31] demon_dandy: One plan at a time, first we defeat timeshareman

[3:34:47] ApocalypseSC: are you required to stay? can you check in and leave or something
[3:34:53] KazooManEvan: two white monsters a day...
[3:34:58] demon_dandy: ICANT
[3:35:00] chinfoil: @apocalypsesc timeshares are generally in really good locations or parts of resort hotels
[3:35:21] Bird_toe: If it was a deal for you, the company wouldn't be making a profit
[3:35:24] ApocalypseSC: no the meeting or whatever you're attending
