[0:35:08] AshtonMarten: imjucario's Follow Age: 6 Month(s), 16 Day(s)
[0:35:23] behoimii: literally me when i accidenatlly kill a family member
[0:37:06] Senoquese: besides the artists, the omori community kinda sucks, but thats with most other indie rpgs as well
[0:37:12] DzyZ_: not really but maybe cuz i was semi spoiled before hand
[0:37:24] behoimii: i don't think of the word emo like that keroke12Sip
[0:37:28] demon_dandy: hrmmm i think since omori IS the emoish game because its more grounded than the others
[0:37:37] imjucario: I mean, I see it as an "emo game" mainly cause of the fans shouting that all the time and the CONSTANT gifs and memes of the characters saying everything in the english dictionary
[0:37:59] mushi_buns: I played it minute one I cant relate BibleThump
[0:38:22] FTLOG_IamDave: damn girl, youre lookin mighty grayscale today
[0:38:46] american_cookie_1: Ah, yes. Sad time
[0:38:55] DiagonalFrameworks: Honestly Omori made me realize that people's comprehension has gone down the drain. I don't remember WHY, its been a while since I engaged with any fans, I only remember that back a year ago or so I was bewildered about how they read the plot.
[0:39:09] american_cookie_1: SHES GOT A WEAPON!!!!!
[0:39:12] Senoquese: its kinda in the same way that youll mostly only see content and fanart about the "dark" parts of undertale
[0:39:24] demon_dandy: yeah true seno
[0:39:27] behoimii: i mean the depictions of depression, self hate, and lot of things are pretty acurate
[0:39:41] american_cookie_1: Emo=mental sadness
[0:40:18] mushi_buns: I think people dont talk about the story at all to keep other spoiler free, cuz you don't find out about the real world until like 2 hours in
[0:40:49] Senoquese: @2am_buns yeah i agree, its hard to describe the games plot without immediately spoiling something
[0:41:32] american_cookie_1: I don’t like reality.
[0:41:42] behoimii: it does make sense, but i don't think you need to kill someone to relate to the mental ilness, or i don0t think omocat killed someone either lellebOtlikethis
[0:41:43] american_cookie_1: Real world make me sad
[0:41:58] demon_dandy: well it might not be directly relatable but its got a lot more overt emotional conveyance than most media like it if that nakes sense
[0:42:25] cakeswindle: manga original chin-chan
[0:42:48] mushi_buns: well it is the plot twist!
[0:42:53] american_cookie_1: yuracyPop
[0:43:01] cakeswindle: weeb <3
[0:43:13] Senoquese: i do remember omocat said she specifically tried to avoid showing any plot elements or rw stuff, she always just describes it as a fun weird rpg
[0:43:24] Senoquese: in advertisement i mean
[0:43:50] american_cookie_1: Why must I have my big sad now?
[0:44:19] DiagonalFrameworks: Eh, I thought it was interesting. Don't you think some stories parallel real life experiences way too closely?
[0:44:48] demon_dandy: i think i get where your coming from it "undermining it" even if its still really good imo
[0:44:50] imjucario: @DiaFR4ME maybe the idea of being forgiving and moving on??
[0:45:05] imjucario: I've never played it, but that seems like a big thing
[0:45:20] american_cookie_1: I didn’t read that in the contract I signed
[0:45:43] mushi_buns: I think some people can relate to omori very heavily, small town drama can get insane
[0:45:47] american_cookie_1: Are you gonna go piss now?
[0:46:00] demon_dandy: the twist is very extremely "catalyzed"(?)  or charged
[0:46:19] american_cookie_1: Small town drama spreads quick.
[0:46:31] demon_dandy: go-py ashton51Spin
[0:46:49] mushi_buns: piss guirl pissssss
[0:46:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin

[0:47:42] american_cookie_1: ^new favorite emote
[0:48:17] DiagonalFrameworks: By parallel real life experiences way too closely, I mean like... You can write a story whatever way, right? Imagine a author suffering something in real life and then writing a story where that exact thing happens. Dog died? Boom, dog dies to exact same disease in disease. I'm satisfied because this story is quite the opposite of that.
[0:48:23] demon_dandy: weba weba ashton51Baby
[0:48:27] EGGNOGKINq: Could you hit the griddy
[0:48:44] DiagonalFrameworks: in story*
[0:48:47] Senoquese: i think people always portray it as a "emo boy game" in a way to attract more players like its a new undertale with a serious story, instead of it just being a meaningless rpg, which i do understand but thats also kinda missing the point
[0:49:27] american_cookie_1: YOU GOT THE NORMAL PILLS?!?!
[0:49:35] behoimii: i guess it's good that you can not relate to the things in omori? that's a good thing keroke12Sip
[0:49:45] demon_dandy: yeah yeah I can get that pov
[0:50:28] Senoquese: theres also the other characters you could relate to that didnt do anything wrong, but youd only find that out later anyways
[0:50:36] mushi_buns: thats the whole thing! its about him finaly gripping with the fact he killed his sister
[0:52:08] mushi_buns: Ash using all her brain cells rn
[0:52:10] demon_dandy: i think fans can still relate to the other parts but yeah i see your pov lmao, a lot of the healing and self care aspect of the early game seems a lil misaligned with the twist part
[0:52:10] DiagonalFrameworks: "Easier to forgive" Missing the point.
[0:52:20] spacechannel4: i dont want to got into it but did you play silent hill games @ashtonmarten ?
[0:52:24] DiagonalFrameworks: Honestly making it something that's easy to forgive would cheapen it so badly.
[0:52:44] DiagonalFrameworks: Honestly
[0:52:50] kentrl_z: well isnt it that he didnt murder his sister (even though he thinks that), it's the fact he hid it in such a way. like it was a manslaughter at most i think
[0:52:50] DiagonalFrameworks: It was a accident
[0:53:10] spacechannel4: i think SH games will be a great playthrough SeemsGood <3
[0:53:10] american_cookie_1: Coming to terms with any traumatic event in your past is always difficult, be it something you did or something that happened to you.
[0:53:30] Senoquese: whether his friends forgive him or not is up to your interpretation after all, even if most fans agree they did
[0:53:59] mushi_buns: I think teens on the internet are bad at recing games at the end of the day
[0:54:19] T33bags: T33bags subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hi Ashton our sub baby will be born in 5 months
[0:54:21] behoimii: i mean the murder part makes it more special, like it's not just thinking how the others are going to react is the thing that sunny loved mari too and that he cannot forgive himself
[0:54:31] kentrl_z: i'd be freaked out only by the fact it was staged a suicide
[0:54:53] american_cookie_1: I… don’t know how I would react.
[0:55:00] demon_dandy: i think fans can still relate to the other parts but yeah i see your pov lmao, a lot of the healing and self care aspect of the early game seems a lil misaligned with the twist part
[0:55:22] mushi_buns: basil build different
[0:55:30] Senoquese: there were some drawings of their reactions that didnt get used, and they all look fucked up
[0:55:50] mushi_buns: I would be most mad about the staged suicided  yeah
[0:55:53] american_cookie_1: Damn, I gotta play this game.
[0:56:08] kentrl_z: i could see this being a crazy thing that happens to a kid and kids have extremely different ideas of harm / death or dont even know its a thing
[0:56:12] demon_dandy: i dont agree with thattt
[0:56:20] kentrl_z: yea its not murder
[0:56:24] american_cookie_1: How did he kill his sister? I don’t know what he did to her
[0:56:45] kentrl_z: in the EYES of the LAW its manslaughter silly marten
[0:56:52] kentrl_z: esp by a kid
[0:57:00] kentrl_z: SECOND DEGREE AKJSHDFKSJDHF
[0:57:04] T33bags: Lmaoooooo
[0:57:04] Playmer: Playmer subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! only 2 months for this strim baby
[0:57:05] Senoquese: the truth book cut text does describe it as a murder but 1) thats cut content and 2) could be sunnys exaggerating it due to the pain
[0:57:17] demon_dandy: someone call huni ashton51Tehe
[0:57:22] behoimii: let's call the police and tell them that we accidentally killed someone and hung them to hide it
[0:57:24] mushi_buns: Well Sunny is so fucked up is his guilt? He didn't want her dead
[0:57:34] kentrl_z: he didnt know he was gonna killher!
[0:57:37] kentrl_z: though
[0:57:45] american_cookie_1: Did he intend to kill her? If so, it’s second. If not, it’s manslaughter
[0:57:59] demon_dandy: the early game does feel kinda disconnect
[0:58:04] kentrl_z: sunny didnt push her with an intent to kill her. he was frustrated and pushed her
[0:58:11] kentrl_z: yaknow like a kids do
[0:58:19] DiagonalFrameworks: kongou3Niko Also it being manslaughter adds more to the story and makes more sense than it being second or first degree murder.
[0:58:26] demon_dandy: i disagree about it being unforgivable tho,  especially in media
[0:58:50] mushi_buns: he wanted to push her down the stairs in the moment not kill her!
[0:59:05] Senoquese: "Photo of Panic - It happened in an instant. You didn't mean to do that. Well, you did mean to push her, didn't you? It was an accident, right? You're not sure. You tremble your way down the staircase."
[0:59:09] kawaiicrew4ever: ayo the pizza here
[0:59:16] demon_dandy: lmaooo
[0:59:23] kentrl_z: how do we even know he wanted to push her down the stairs? he pushed her, and he threw his VIOLIN down the stairs, and then they got in a fight
[0:59:36] mushi_buns: its an important difference!!
[0:59:38] metaconstruct: ashton51Wiggly
[0:59:56] american_cookie_1: I want to push my brother down the stairs, too. Does it mean I want him dead? No.
[1:00:00] behoimii: the other thing too is, like the will to live from sunny, like he knows what he did and wanted to die for it, but he still wanted to continue to live, and that's hard even to understand for yourself
[1:00:11] T33bags: I think he’s so young he doesn’t get reprimanded because of child ignorance and the parents are instead reprimanded for not addressing issues in the household that led to the conflict
[1:00:24] kentrl_z: yeah they were arguing and he threw his violin to break it down the stairs
[1:00:42] demon_dandy: I feel either way, the burden of forgiveness falls in the same area, intent or not ashton51Tehe
[1:00:45] american_cookie_1: You know what? I’m gonna push my brother down the stairs.
[1:00:46] mushi_buns: in the end of the day the parents should get charged with child neglect smh
[1:01:18] Senoquese: realistically sunny wouldnt be forgiven and it would be murder, but in a realistic setting sunny also wouldnt feel the random urge to leave the house in the first place
[1:01:18] kentrl_z: ash do you fully believe sunny had an intent to kill his sister, like not just push her, but pushed her with the intent for her to die down the stairs?
[1:01:30] kentrl_z: THEN
[1:01:32] american_cookie_1: He stopped breathing
[1:01:34] kentrl_z: THAT IS MANSLAUGHTER
[1:01:39] behoimii: let's test how realistic omori is lets throw someone sown the stairs keroke12Sip
[1:01:44] kentrl_z: PLAYED URSELF MARTEN
[1:01:57] T33bags: Depends on how she falls but she could survive falling down
[1:02:06] kentrl_z: u literally just described 'intent to harm' not kill
[1:02:08] mushi_buns: people can die from falling down the stairs, depends what you  hit on the way down
[1:02:30] T33bags: But also these laws only really apply to adults lmao
[1:02:54] kentrl_z: MAN
[1:02:56] kentrl_z: SLAUGHTER!
[1:03:01] Senoquese: the biggest issue would be sunny and basil trying to cover it up, if they just called an ambulance or their parents it would be an accident
[1:03:15] behoimii: tomorrow the police showing where ashton lives for looking up so much things about murder
[1:03:17] T33bags: There’s a difference in the punishments and judgements for children because of their irrational nature up to a certain age
[1:03:31] demon_dandy: manslaughter is moreso "murder" without directed violence
[1:03:32] kentrl_z: yeah but then the whole story wouldnt be a thing of them hiding it and being stupid kids and having the guilt for years
[1:03:41] kentrl_z: but thats not really the point of the argument i guess lol
[1:03:48] kentrl_z: yea yea yea
[1:03:52] kawaiicrew4ever: let her cook
[1:04:00] kentrl_z: LMAO
[1:04:03] american_cookie_1: How old was he when he pushed her?
[1:04:10] HarrisonFjord: what was she cooking!!!
[1:04:18] american_cookie_1: I don’t know the full lore
[1:04:21] demon_dandy: who let her cook?? ashton51Tehe
[1:04:28] behoimii: ok, if you want to argue so much, i will have to bring my knife too
[1:04:40] american_cookie_1: MOM!!! VS DAAAADDD!!! BEGIN!!
[1:04:49] HarrisonFjord: how old were the kids btw
[1:04:54] HarrisonFjord: could be tried as an adult
[1:05:01] HarrisonFjord: oh nvm
[1:05:13] Senoquese: basil did plan the whole suicide thing, sunny was just following orders while out of it, but i think he only did it out of desperation to make sunny look innocent
[1:05:13] T33bags: You would be the newspaper editor that calls him “young man” instead “preteen” to fluff it up lmao @ashtonmarten
[1:05:34] demon_dandy: ashton vs phoenix wright, battle of the ages
[1:05:49] american_cookie_1: It’s not a court case. It’s an Epic Rap Battle of History
[1:05:54] kentrl_z: i will say, the game or at least SUNNY in his own mind wants to think it was murder, because of his guilt and hatred of himself. so i can understand seeing it as more insane and dramatic in the eyes of someone who thinks they deserve like... death (like we know sunny has thought about suicide and stuff)
[1:06:06] behoimii: oh yeah, one of the dialog of sunny's mom in the truth section is: my only daughter gone, and you are my only son, i cant lose you as well" maybe she fought for him so didn't get any charges?
[1:06:08] mushi_buns: basil the true wacky on imo
[1:06:13] DiagonalFrameworks: Why does Basil like Sunny so much?

[1:07:08] T33bags: Coughing Baby vs Hydrogen Bomb

[1:07:37] DiagonalFrameworks: Honestly? Yes, my "headcanon" (Not sure how much headcanon it is when you let your knowledge of the author influence you) was that he is gay. Given who the author is, I thought that might have been it but then she decided not to include any of that into the game.
[1:07:40] behoimii: discussion points of ashton omori stream: 1- second degree murder 2- basil sexuality
[1:07:46] kentrl_z: because after that event happened, they only people who knew about it was eachother, so they were isolated and together in that truth. (which is way sunny is both scared and sad around sunny)

[1:09:04] Senoquese: also, a common theory is that basil went to the hangout spot lake to drown himself, and thats why he gave sunny the photobook
[1:09:10] mushi_buns: thats up to interpterion I think, ghost mari
[1:09:15] DiagonalFrameworks: I guess its because of that "My thoughts will follow you into your dreams" Flower but ehhh I don't think its interesting that way.
[1:09:27] T33bags: @american_cookie_1 Basil vs Homosexuality epic rap battles of history
[1:09:27] Kitkattack: ... just makes me think of that trash brain rot anime about being a neet

[1:09:42] american_cookie_1: ashton51Spin *Freebird solo*
[1:09:51] Senoquese: maybe WE were mari all along...
[1:10:10] kentrl_z: i would understand that, because imagine if your sibling did something like that when they were a kid, and blamed themselves so much that he could no longer live in own life, or live his life for mari, but die in despair. its wrong but after such a terrible mistake as a kid, mari would want her baby brother to live. i thiiinkkk
[1:10:33] DiagonalFrameworks: Unironically though, Omo "I wish I was a drifloon" Cat would definitely make Basil gay.
[1:10:34] behoimii: at the end i thought that the egret orchid meaning, was supossed to represent basil thoughts that follows omori into his dreams, like the "you couldn't have done it it was something behind you"
[1:10:50] demon_dandy: lmao ashton51Tehe
