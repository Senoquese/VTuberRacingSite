[2:48:18] plazynoodles: gestural drawings
[2:48:22] ReyJaggy: Its becoming the standarrd
[2:49:02] Senoquese: ive seen ai tools where you can draw arrows and whatever on pictures, and itll actually animate the stuff moving in that direction. technically impressive but fuck that
[2:49:12] demon_dandy: i  feel mean assuming some artists are ai (if rhey have some history of drawing) but  ive def seen some questionable stuffs, it really hurts the heart

[2:50:41] Senoquese: it could be the most beautiful art in the world and it still sucks tho, the biggest problem is the moral side of it
[2:50:46] dax812: ai art looks like when a western artist draws anime
[2:50:51] MeadowAtLast: there are things about it that look good but the more you look at it the worse it gets
[2:50:58] demon_dandy: Yeah pretty much soulless
[2:51:24] KarikariPanko: @Senoquese I think this kind of technology would be ok if its trained on stuff they own the rights to. its the kind of shortcut that can help artists rather than substitute them
[2:51:25] its_Ronin_1: Dose my picrew automatically send to you? Or do you need me too send it somewhere?
[2:51:31] dax812: But currently ai cant produce art without heavily referencing other artist's work without their permission so I can't enjoy it ashton51Wah ashton51Wah
[2:51:36] its_Ronin_1: Does

[2:53:11] dax812: Yeah creeps with ai are the worst thing to come from the technology
[2:53:18] horribleham: Oh yeah that's a thing. That's so scummy
[2:53:19] sirvampire777: very creepy
[2:53:31] plazynoodles: yeah its very scary because its making deepfakes more believable, a twitch streamer got caught watching deepfakes of his peers
[2:53:43] Senoquese: i can forgive AI simply because of the ashton chatgpt bot, that shit is so funny
[2:54:02] Warpheus_Ur: Remember when deep fakes were just baka mitai memes
[2:54:03] dax812: I am pretty interested in the ai that's being used to make infinite dialogue options in video games
[2:54:15] dax812: cause that's just being trained off general knowledge
[2:54:38] taichi65: omigosh your picrew is so cuteeee taichi5Sip
[2:54:43] plazynoodles: yeah theres some very good AI that has existed before this its just the unethical sourcing and greedy models ppl use
[2:54:56] dax812: I feel like ai voice mimicking is okay when it's an actor doing a character's voice rather than the actual person's voice
[2:55:04] ChessCatUWU: Plankton singing The Sound of Silence is the best thing to come out of ai.
[2:55:04] freyklin: Cool drawing bro is that a crocodile?
[2:55:04] its_Ronin_1: Hey, the scammers are making a pretty buck off of it

[2:55:17] plazynoodles: @dax812 actually some VAs have spoken up against that
[2:55:21] Senoquese: @dax812 idk! its interesting but the important part of dialogue and a character imo is it being written with soul and ideas in mind
[2:55:53] T33bags: Yeah it was AI very disgusting stuff I can’t imagine feeling so vulnerable and seen like that when you are non consenting to your body being posted like that
[2:55:55] dax812: oh shoot that makes sense actually since its kinda like voice actors working for free now that i think of it
[2:55:56] Warpheus_Ur: I feel like I'd always choose the aggressive dialogue option if games had the ai generated responses
