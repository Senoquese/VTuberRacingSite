[3:09:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Squish i understand
[3:09:57] KyuuMJ: Y'mentioned how y'did not get into Yakuza 0, so why sing that one?
[3:10:00] demon_dandy: Hmmmm
[3:10:02] Navy_Mongoose: I love The Distance, but it's not a very impressive vocal song
[3:10:18] BudderZilla: Ashy washyy
[3:10:37] Navy_Mongoose: No I mean it really is just sort of talking, not fun to sing
[3:11:02] FatInTheCat: Would you like to sing an acoustic yandere japanese song?
[3:11:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I like Sanic
[3:11:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: LETS FUCKING GO
[3:11:15] demon_dandy: I like sos more thsn the other songs
[3:11:21] KyuuMJ: I'd lean on SOS actually
[3:11:26] Amai_Umimaru: sos or internet overdose
[3:11:37] Amai_Umimaru: the art of ashton in the sos pose would be so cute!
[3:11:37] beat_shobon: You'd do great with SOS, if you have fun with it it counts

[3:14:50] Navy_Mongoose: sing 4 and make the 5th an encore
[3:15:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Who you working with for the mixing and all that?
[3:15:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You working with Sugar?
[3:15:21] demon_dandy: Babymetal seems the most random?
[3:15:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Sugarskull?
[3:15:32] plazynoodles: i think babymetal should be cut??
[3:15:33] plazynoodles: yeah
[3:15:52] plazynoodles: its a good song but maybe it doesnt suit your brand as an introduction to you as a vtuber
