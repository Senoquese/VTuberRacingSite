[0:40:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it makes the lights better
[0:40:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BUT its not worth it
[0:40:12] Senoquese: its realistic reflection w light bouncing
[0:40:13] JTBun: it makes lighting nice and pretty
[0:40:29] Senoquese: its like doing real time reflections with particles instead of textures
[0:40:42] Burr11: might have to restart game now yeah
[0:40:51] Senoquese: ray tracing shouldnt need it

[0:42:01] JTBun: yes
[0:42:02] Matharu_: Left Trigger no?
[0:42:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cluth is left bumper
[0:42:08] flickmannss: Trigger*
[0:42:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: left trigger is regular break
[0:42:11] HashiriyaR32: Left trigger is regular brake
[0:42:11] asilveras: rtx, dlss3 frame gen, fsr dual GPU smoooooth
[0:42:21] Senoquese: clutch is for manual iirc
[0:42:23] JTBun: I don't think she is playing on manual
[0:42:34] imnoteds: thats the valo thing ashton51Tensai
[0:42:34] flickmannss: e-brake for driifting
[0:42:41] demon_dandy: LMAO eds
[0:42:41] asilveras: E brake? so you know about E-girls, ashton?
[0:42:44] rikkaonline: not really
[0:42:45] flickmannss: but depending on the car braking can aso drift
[0:42:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Ebrake is for drift or you can left foot brake to transition weight yes
[0:42:56] Matharu_: E-Brake locks your wheels so don't want that to take corners, but for drifting, you can just tap the E-Brake while turning
[0:42:58] rikkaonline: normal brakes = front wheels ebrake = back wheels
[0:43:00] JTBun: use regular brake for turns
[0:43:07] Senoquese: id say just do your own thing and figure out what works for you
[0:43:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: WELL REGULAR BRAKE IS LEFT FOOT BRAKE lol
[0:43:12] rikkaonline: youll want to focus on regular brakes
[0:43:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: slowly pull the trigger
[0:43:25] ÁÅ´ËÖøÂºüÂºü: you step on clutch with your left leg when you want to shift gear
[0:43:25] rikkaonline: when you ebrake it locks the rear wheels
[0:43:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: itll slowly increase the brake pressure
[0:43:32] flickmannss: just normally brake when you go thru the red chevrons then you can accel once they turn blue
[0:43:37] Matharu_: she wanna do the KANSEI DORIFTO
[0:43:40] magneticreflection: e brake isnt used for normal racing
[0:43:42] Senoquese: LMAO it does that sometimes
[0:43:42] flickmannss: it's simple
[0:43:44] JTBun: Forza is a good game
[0:43:46] moush: it prob also depends on the car
[0:43:48] JTBun: ashton51Smile
[0:43:48] demon_dandy: Cursed ass game ashton51Wibble
[0:43:48] asilveras: game's good
[0:43:50] rikkaonline: since this is realistic, you wont be drifting as much as mario kart
[0:43:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its not simple
[0:43:56] jcall__: if you wanna brake for turns use regular brake and brake in as straight of a line as possible before turning the car into the turn
[0:43:56] flickmannss: ashton51Omegalul
[0:44:06] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it took me a month to learn racing rules
[0:44:07] rikkaonline: oh its definitely complicated lol
[0:44:11] Senoquese: i rember chat would go in these "simple braking tutorial" during the early streams LMAO
[0:44:13] asilveras: it's a shrimple as pressing the braking
[0:44:22] Burr11: yes.. also sometimes you just have to ease up on the gas rather than brake as hard
[0:44:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah you never wanna start braking mid turn brake before the turn.
[0:44:28] demon_dandy: The simple mario drift tutorial ashton51Tehe
[0:44:29] Matharu_: ""are there even racing rules?"" yeah just hit everyone, I also do that ashton51Omegalul
[0:44:34] rikkaonline: ebrake is WAY easier to lose control
[0:44:37] flickmannss: yes, keep a look at the chevrons on the road, they tell you when to brake and accel
[0:44:38] imnoteds: literally dont crash easy
[0:44:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yes
[0:44:42] magneticreflection: ebrake is only used for drifting
[0:44:42] demon_dandy: TRUE matharu ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[0:44:43] rikkaonline: locking wheels = no control
[0:44:50] Burr11: i never use ebrake
[0:44:56] rikkaonline: mario kart
[0:45:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: depends on your driving style
[0:45:04] magneticreflection: drifting is never faster
[0:45:07] Burr11: drifting is never faster yeah
[0:45:12] demon_dandy: When you wanna swag out obviously ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai

[0:45:27] demon_dandy: But the swagggf ashton51Wibble
[0:45:31] Hefewy9: Drifting is good if using Manual
[0:45:32] rikkaonline: imo, get better at regular driving first
[0:45:33] flickmannss: if you're racing you wanna drive for reals, but there's drift centered events
[0:45:33] Burr11: yeah if you wanna rack up points then drift thats fine but if you're trying to stay on the road doint
[0:45:38] ÁÅ´ËÖøÂºüÂºü: drifting is never faster, but it is the most exciting way to turn
[0:45:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: drifting makes hairpins easier
[0:45:47] rikkaonline: just removing gas isnt drifitng
[0:45:50] Senoquese: thats just turning ig?
[0:45:57] Hefewy9: Drifting is also fun and cool which makes it worth it
[0:45:57] PhatNapkin: What's good, Ashton? Are ya winnin'?
[0:46:05] demon_dandy: Is this game actually crashed?
[0:46:19] demon_dandy: ashton51Squish
[0:46:20] Burr11: aw
[0:46:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it took me time to restart it.
[0:46:25] Matharu_: forza gave up mathar3Vanish
[0:46:29] JTBun: it probably slides out because you are going too fast
[0:46:29] magneticreflection: unintentional drifting is called oversteer
[0:46:30] imnoteds: its jover
[0:46:33] PhatNapkin: The correct technique is to pick the AE86
[0:46:36] ReyJaggy: if you think about it not playing is winning since you dont have to worry about playing forza
[0:46:38] Matharu_: :O ?
[0:46:38] Burr11: i shouldnt have told you to restart my bad
[0:46:40] flickmannss: i'd try to coach for this ashton51Omegalul

[5:46:32] MS06_Borjarnon: I tried actual go-kart racing and I don't know how to overtake anyone. Car games are so generous in getting AI to slow down for ya.

[5:48:01] AkaiHomura: i guess the racing line, which i do in some races too since its hard to know where you are going in some races
[5:48:07] horribleham: SHE'S ADDICTED
[5:48:07] MS06_Borjarnon: Well, the place had rules that if I broke (like collissions and such), the kart would lock up. So even if I knew how to drift actual vehicles, I wouldn't be allowed to, likely.
[5:48:09] Senoquese: ashton51Stare
[5:48:16] demon_dandy: I mean its good she had fun ashton51Tehe
[5:48:28] MS06_Borjarnon: collisions*, rather
[5:48:30] whereistano: I added you that way you know when you need to buy cars or sell cars
[5:48:49] AkaiHomura: i learned to follow race line basics illegally irl. and did some reeal race track days which made me understand some more of it
[5:49:31] Trent7004: Gotta step on the gas!!!
[5:49:39] Nullamm: racing lines are good, but there are better ways to take some corners. you'd get better as you play
[5:49:53] whereistano: @ashtonmarten I added you that way you know when you need to buy cars or sell cars
[5:50:06] ReyJaggy: go incognito in the ax mahjong tablet
[5:50:15] ReyJaggy: table
[5:50:17] AkaiHomura: basically if you follow race lines properly you can actually feel you are accerlating close to a straight line. which you dont really get the same feel thru a monitor
[5:50:42] ReyJaggy: idk about official
[5:50:46] ReyJaggy: but ive seen people play
[5:50:58] AkaiHomura: i suck at overtaking defensive drivers in go karting too, but can drive race lines or drift reasonably well

[5:51:51] AkaiHomura: btw a tip to follw race lines better, aim for the edge of flags you got to stay inside
[5:52:06] Nullamm: That's usually how it goes. 1st place  is a better AI
[5:52:15] whereistano: That‚Äôs sad that means that 40% of all your streams is gonna be your buying cars from me or me giving you forza credits
[5:52:21] fys0n: Do you really like BMWs?

[5:52:35] MS06_Borjarnon: Ah, so you pattern your Twitch channel from your profession?
[5:52:44] AkaiHomura: start further out, and aim more towards the middle of it, you can actually hit the flag and be fine as long as you dont go outside

[6:09:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Heres the real hoonicorn. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg6L_7qLIEQ
[6:09:23] MS06_Borjarnon: So, why have the flame exhaust go up and in front of the driver's view instead of all the way to the rear or some other place unintrusive?
[6:09:28] Matharu_: nah, it posted with the other one
[6:09:36] JTBun: that was so cool
[6:09:49] EspirituDeSangre: I do play a lot of racing games, especially rally ones
[6:09:55] Matharu_: I say I kinda finished both videos at the same time
[6:09:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @MS06_Borjarnon they did it because the exhaust heats up too much
[6:10:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it cant go under the driver.
[6:10:04] MS06_Borjarnon: That disclaimer will be ignored because car drivers are awful for the reason the stream title indicates. Comedic, but also realistic.
