[1:04:30] PsycheTH: they should let you buy it in CCVs, 1 viewer = $1
[1:04:35] Fireflye645: It doesn't sound too different from other professional conventions aside from the steep cost of affording to go
[1:04:35] DavidPortnov: @olandgren Exactly. I look every year. It's painful.
[1:04:39] Kitkattack: it seems to me like they just want to drive the most obsessive fans

[1:05:20] JTBun: like the only reason why a viewer would go to twitchcon is to see their fav streamer, and thats stupid... because who wants to go to a convention where all the booths are just dumb marketing that you wont care about unless your stream
[1:05:22] ReyJaggy: Did they lower the price?? Its now $249 for 3 days
[1:05:25] redactedenheim: yep
[1:05:36] Senoquese: those 300 dollars could have been spent on better equipment or assets and that would go way further than whatever lessons youd get there

[4:07:36] OrminTheBox: the ss remake is so good
[4:07:40] zer0hazard: cutting edge for 1996
[4:07:43] PSYCOMMUnist: A lot of this is taken from System Shock which is regarded as having MUCH better writing
[4:07:50] PSYCOMMUnist: So if you want this game but more mature there's that
[4:07:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: isnt the bioshock remake kinda better?
[4:07:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cuz it fixes a lot of shit?
[4:07:55] Qrockpot: you played infinite?
