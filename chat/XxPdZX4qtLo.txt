[1:01:24] Ortintzki: Ortintzki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[1:01:36] ÂçÅÂπ≤: how can they afford to host it each year and pay their creators
[1:01:41] Paperguide: @buruhas Special chinchilla mask
[1:02:00] Paperguide: Twitchcon sucks unless you have access to partner events
[1:02:10] tripsout2: three HUNDRED?

[1:02:12] Aefen: I'm glad we have offkai for vtuber centric things then
[1:02:16] jherchin12345: THREE HUNDIE!!?!?!?!
[1:02:18] Fireflye645: @Aefen An excuse to meet online friends really
[1:02:29] Ortintzki: Ashton is too famous and spectacular to moderate her opinion.
[1:02:36] Senoquese: 300 dollar tickets to make up for all the lost money from the ceo donoing to random streamers
[1:02:37] ÂçÅÂπ≤: dang 300 they are really pressing this economy for sure
[1:02:40] ScarletRook: You could buy 3 tickets to 3 different cons at that price
[1:02:45] Fireflye645: It really would but there's definitely loads of people who don't want to go to anime cons
[1:02:53] Aefen: she's spitting facts
[1:03:05] redactedenheim: $300 plus airfare plus hotel plus fudz, lots monies
[1:03:19] Aefen: the ever humble Ashton Marten
[1:03:35] ÂçÅÂπ≤: or wut about just a casual visitor ??
[1:03:42] Senoquese: yeah scummy

[1:03:55] redactedenheim: how much is a dream? $300 apparently
[1:04:07] Senoquese: if you pay you COULD get more following!! kinda deal
[1:04:10] JTBun: meet your fav streamer!!!! and then most of it is marketing
[1:04:14] olandgren: never look at how much GDC costs lol
[1:04:26] PikelArt: popopo3Wave
[1:04:30] PsycheTH: they should let you buy it in CCVs, 1 viewer = $1
[1:04:35] Fireflye645: It doesn't sound too different from other professional conventions aside from the steep cost of affording to go
[1:04:35] DavidPortnov: @olandgren Exactly. I look every year. It's painful.
[1:04:39] Kitkattack: it seems to me like they just want to drive the most obsessive fans
[1:04:39] redactedenheim: how to engage your chat: yap about england
[1:04:47] ÂçÅÂπ≤: are they like selling a lifestyle that's unobtainable is that what ur saying
[1:04:56] PSYCOMMUnist: lol MLM

[1:05:12] pogotross: wait Dr Disrespect didn't have a degree???
[1:05:15] demon_dandy: Its kinda mixing it in with fandoms
[1:05:20] JTBun: like the only reason why a viewer would go to twitchcon is to see their fav streamer, and thats stupid... because who wants to go to a convention where all the booths are just dumb marketing that you wont care about unless your stream
[1:05:22] ReyJaggy: Did they lower the price?? Its now $249 for 3 days
[1:05:25] redactedenheim: yep
[1:05:36] Senoquese: those 300 dollars could have been spent on better equipment or assets and that would go way further than whatever lessons youd get there
[1:05:44] ReyJaggy: No i remember seeing it at $300
[1:05:49] ÂçÅÂπ≤: a sponored appearance

[1:06:16] ÂçÅÂπ≤: I have noticed how drastic it is for smaller creators on twitch
[1:06:18] Aefen: that's insane
[1:06:27] redactedenheim: I blew my convention vacation on anyc this year
[1:06:31] PsycheTH: how have we not made a joke about the double meaning of con yet
[1:06:43] Ortintzki: ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run
