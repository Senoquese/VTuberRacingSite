[1:39:14] the_ol_regular: Barry and Chris are forbidden to interact with each other in Resi 1

[1:44:11] Navy_Mongoose: none of the good lines from the original are here ashton51Despair
[1:44:16] ScholarofGames: That and one other change in this game makes me prefer the OG over this one.

[1:48:56] the_ol_regular: Hopefully Ash finds the dogs
[1:49:06] xivandroid: they had deer as an invasive species so they just caught all of them and put them into factory farms

[2:14:02] ZippiBelfast: Zombie moisture
[2:14:11] FranzNF: oh so JK Rowling's house
[2:14:12] zonekami: Also if you stack zombie bodies you can burn 2 for 1 kerosene.
[2:14:14] xivandroid: I got spirits within for like $5 from a big bin full of spirits within dvds labeled clearance at a bestbuy like 20 years ago
[2:14:17] theperfecttoastersetting: @the_ol_regular I don't cook on the wood floor

[2:15:45] ScholarofGames: Yeah this is the most puzzle based one.
[2:16:07] ScholarofGames: 2 has some puzzles as well.
[2:16:07] 99d9: RE5 lmao
[2:16:14] the_ol_regular: As I always say, I can appreciate Capcom experimenting with the sequels
[2:16:26] ScholarofGames: After that they drift into that action direction more and more.
[2:16:30] Navy_Mongoose: the older REs are generally puzzle games, then 4 throws that all out
[2:16:33] anonsama9001: it could be argued dino crisis is the most puzzle heavy RE LUL

[2:17:24] ScholarofGames: There are a few puzzles but very few.
[2:17:47] 0NIB0: yeah RE4 is amazing and while it does have some puzzles, it's nowhere near the amount as older REs
[2:17:48] demon_dandy: I think youll enjoy the action ones too cause they play very uniquely
[2:18:03] the_ol_regular: Resi 7 had puzzles
[2:18:09] 99d9: GET OFF MA LAWN

[2:55:22] shindigs: NL is the only male hag rep we have
[2:55:32] shindigs: the animations are crazy for 2002??
[2:55:43] InsaneLoke: idk, jerma is almost 40
[2:55:46] Navy_Mongoose: ded
[2:55:54] MintCastella: @shindigs it was a ridiculously good looking game at the time and still is!!!!
[2:56:13] MintCastella: the style of this one is hard to beat
[2:56:26] MintCastella: video game graphics have been good graphics since like 2000 anyway
[2:56:31] demon_dandy: Putting ashton in vr for re7
[2:56:59] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[2:57:00] MintCastella: its a PS4 exclusive thing rip
[2:57:07] Navy_Mongoose: RE7 is perfect for VR
[2:57:11] StreamElements: Stream my first original song 『 RACING LINE 』 now! https://ffm.to/racingline (It's eurobeat!)
[2:57:11] InsaneLoke: there is a VR verison
[2:57:21] Navy_Mongoose: it's all first person anyway
[2:57:26] FranzNF: i'd take games having this level of graphics over hyperrealism but no substance
[2:57:27] demon_dandy: You can play the whole thing in vr but its exclusive ashton51Tehe
[2:57:29] ScholarofGames: Pretty sure it was made the way it was BECAUSE of VR
[2:57:36] shindigs: this game looks good because art direction
[2:57:46] shindigs: RE7 looks good too i dunno
[2:58:27] 99d9: nyanabGun
[2:59:17] MintCastella: YES!!!!!!!!!!
[2:59:28] ScholarofGames: Oh, there's a dawg!
[2:59:31] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[2:59:32] MintCastella: tank controls and fixed camera angles need to come back
[2:59:35] MintCastella: in a BIG way
[2:59:43] demon_dandy: nah frrr
[3:00:00] MintCastella: it is way more cinematic! you see what the director wants you to and that lets them set a tone and stuff.. its so good
[3:00:02] ScholarofGames: People would probably bitch to high heaven.
[3:00:30] 99d9: i think that the tank controls and fixed cameras definitely add to this game’s horror feel
[3:00:37] InsaneLoke: oui
[3:00:38] Navy_Mongoose: ouioui
[3:00:39] MintCastella: like that angle! and that one! these are all picked on purpose for vibe right?? it just contributes so much to tone.. its so cool
[3:00:43] demon_dandy: shes a ouioui ashton51Wah
[3:00:52] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:00:54] FranzNF: el ouioui
[3:01:38] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[3:01:39] 99d9: wish I knew more about camera angles and stuff. only started appreciating it when i first heard vinny talk about it
[3:01:51] JonasPolsky: comfie1Wave comfie1Wave comfie1Wave comfie1Wave
[3:01:53] Navy_Mongoose: just pop in the RE DX DS OST ashton51Stare
[3:02:11] ScholarofGames: It does have a certain charm for sure, but if they never come back it wouldn't bother me that much.
[3:02:21] MintCastella: i love when the game tells you an item is done and you can throw it away....
[3:02:34] Navy_Mongoose: I think its hard to top the level design of the mansion
[3:02:42] MintCastella: original RE2 is as puzzle-y!!
[3:02:48] shindigs: there's gonna be a huge indie hit that sells a schmillion dollars with tank controls and it will cause twitter to go crazy
[3:02:51] ScholarofGames: Yeah RE2 is puzzely.
[3:02:59] Navy_Mongoose: no, the next bunch are puzzles too
[3:03:00] JonasPolsky: @MintCastella now you have the freedom to manually throw it away comfie1Pls
[3:03:00] ScholarofGames: It's also the best game in the series I think.
[3:03:02] InsaneLoke: most of them arent THAT actiony
[3:03:02] MintCastella: original RE2 ruuuuuuuuules. and so does original re3
[3:03:05] UNSC_Saratoga: RE2 is very good
[3:03:14] anonsama9001: i've been boycotting capcom out of principle since like 2017 when they announced it RE2 remake was ots
[3:03:16] MintCastella: @shindigs signalis had tank controls!! i played it that way
[3:03:27] Navy_Mongoose: RE4-6 are where they throw the puzzles out the window
[3:03:29] demon_dandy: I love re2 remake but og re2 still hits so different ashton51Tehe
[3:03:29] shindigs: oh shit you're right. i did enjoy signalis (need to finish)
[3:03:33] shindigs: signalis is excellent
[3:03:36] JonasPolsky: @shindigs Crow Country is exactly that game
[3:03:36] Senoquese: signalis good
[3:03:58] Funchucks: there should be a game where a madman has surgically made you into a tiny tank, to justify the tank controls
[3:04:06] ScholarofGames: I'd say 5 and 6 is where they throw them out the window, 4 at least has a few. Mind you there are so few that you could say it doesn't have puzzles but they are there.
[3:04:09] Navy_Mongoose: I have a hard time deciding whether I prefer RE2 or its remake, they're both so good
[3:04:11] demon_dandy: LOL now you can finally learn what jet was crying about when you raided into her playing it ashton51Omegalul
[3:04:13] shindigs: if amos ever updates his look, his stream will look like this game
[3:04:26] ScholarofGames: OG RE2 no questions asked.
[3:04:45] FranzNF: i think from re4 it becomes a completely different type of game, but it actually is my favorite one so it's weird
[3:05:01] ScholarofGames: Mind you I love that game so much that there are a few things about the Remake of 2 that just...annoys the hell out of me.

[3:05:24] Navy_Mongoose: lolno
[3:05:25] ScholarofGames: 4 is tied for me with 2 honestly.
[3:05:28] FranzNF: lmao

[3:05:59] ScholarofGames: What would you use musical sheet music for?
[3:06:00] JonasPolsky: I got really, really good at the RE4 time attack mode comfie1Rave
[3:06:08] FranzNF: she's been traumatized by heavy game time loss
[3:06:15] 99d9: burn it for warmth
[3:06:27] ScholarofGames: Didn't you see a piano? Kappa
[3:06:29] Navy_Mongoose: burn it in place of kerosene ashton51Stare
[3:06:46] Xuang101: Hi ashton
[3:07:01] Navy_Mongoose: more like Jill doesn't have xray vision
[3:07:12] ScholarofGames: Well yeah how do you use sheet music and play the piano if you don't have something to hold the sheet music while you play.
[3:07:18] ScholarofGames: ?
[3:07:30] 99d9: every room in this mansion feels so comfy and like i could sleep there

[3:09:52] shindigs: we need gamer supps for sleeping 8 hours
[3:09:55] ReyJaggy: Our brain is full of ashyton
[3:10:20] FranzNF: brain full of Ashton, ashtonite and ashtonisms
[3:10:20] anonsama9001: yikes i did that for like 3-4 months and yeah it did a number to me
[3:10:25] Xuang101: Oh do you have trouble falling asleep?

[3:10:51] Xuang101: Yah you kinda turn into a zombie with no sleep

[3:14:35] gozuutennoh: knightbrutus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[3:14:54] JTBun: Imma eep too, goob night ashy and pitcrew ashton51Love
[3:15:17] EagerJay: I gotta head out for now but you have a good night!
[3:15:38] ScholarofGames: But I've played the game a ridiculously amount so the most common complain of the game isn't really an issue for me because I know how to wrestle the damn thing.
[3:15:53] InsaneLoke: your journey playing games feels like those posts where its like "getting into rap, when does it get good" and they are holding a record from the 1920s
[3:15:55] ElemethSigma: zombie mansion thunderstorm ASMR
[3:16:10] FrankieXanadu: Granted very few games truly feel like Jet Set Radio, so you would be forgiven with finding that one difficult at first.
[3:16:28] ZaneTheZuchon: Just call me Zane thanks!!!
[3:16:33] ScholarofGames: Still wish JSR Future would get a port already.
[3:16:51] the_ol_regular: I just want a new Sunset Overdrive
[3:16:53] anonsama9001: beat an NES game too, been quite a year
[3:16:58] the_ol_regular: (I go back to eep)
[3:17:00] InsaneLoke: uh
[3:17:01] FrankieXanadu: I imagine the difficulty they have porting many of these games is music licensing costs.
[3:17:18] Navy_Mongoose: boom headshot
[3:17:22] 99d9: good meat noises
[3:17:22] ScholarofGames: Well...he ain't getting up now.

[3:22:47] DoingDennis: I was wondering if it sold out yet
[3:23:00] Navy_Mongoose: you can only do that if they grab your leg
[3:23:02] ScholarofGames: That happens if you get grabed on the ground.
[3:23:09] ScholarofGames: Which means you take damage.
[3:23:09] DoingDennis: I believe!
[3:24:09] FranzNF: the herbs and spices
[3:24:21] ScholarofGames: Well that's weird.
[3:24:35] ScholarofGames: I'm not used to this track playing here.
[3:25:01] ScholarofGames: Plays elsewhere in the OG.

[3:32:20] DoingDennis: Not sure, but I think they did make it if you pause the vod it does run a ad right?
[3:33:16] UNSC_Saratoga: If you take a break for a few minutes every stream and run ads during it nobody will miss anything and you can go to the bathroom and get food and stuff
[3:33:57] 99d9: just think of the dr peppers…

[3:35:00] VentisVeilborne: Hai Hai Ashton! Hows the Residents of Evil going?
[3:35:14] UNSC_Saratoga: We all get that you need to run ads to make money.

[3:40:43] ScholarofGames: No.
[3:40:46] VentisVeilborne: RE2 remake came out in 2019
[3:40:48] ScholarofGames: OG was like 98
[3:40:49] Navy_Mongoose: remake came out 6 years ago
[3:40:52] UNSC_Saratoga: The remake was in 2022
[3:40:53] InsaneLoke: the remake is 10 years ago
[3:40:59] ScholarofGames: Good choice.
[3:41:02] Navy_Mongoose: oh my god
[3:41:05] ScholarofGames: Better verison.
[3:41:10] anonsama9001: based beyond belief
[3:41:16] InsaneLoke: i wonder which is the real one hmmm
[3:41:25] Navy_Mongoose: 19, 5 years old
[3:41:38] VentisVeilborne: RE1 Remaster is 2014, RE2 Remake is 2019, RE3 Remake was 2020
[3:42:06] ScholarofGames: Eventually I'd say do both, both are great games.
[3:42:36] ScholarofGames: But if you play the OG first you could understand some of my old man grumblings with the remake.
[3:42:46] 99d9: xen remake kicks ass
[3:42:48] schlipschlop: there's also the resident evil 0 remake, which is in the same style as this game
[3:43:05] UNSC_Saratoga: Either he was sciencey, a weirdo, or a wciencey weirdo.
[3:43:14] VentisVeilborne: Both are really good and have their values. OG tho holds a special place
[3:43:16] ScholarofGames: Well 0 isn't really a remake, it's a remaster.
[3:43:24] ScholarofGames: 0 is just a polished up port.
[3:44:16] ScholarofGames: But yeah this game and 0 were made at the same time
[3:44:27] FranzNF: yeah you did
[3:44:37] UNSC_Saratoga: I’m a graphics whore. If I can have an updated version over an original version then I’ll always take it
[3:44:39] ScholarofGames: Or well about the same time.
[3:44:44] Navy_Mongoose: welp
[3:44:55] Navy_Mongoose: !jump
[3:45:24] ScholarofGames: I mean.
[3:45:26] Navy_Mongoose: for some reason I thought they would get up and swing at you
[3:45:35] ScholarofGames: Almost dying is what I would call real bad.
[3:45:46] FranzNF: btw the hint was there in the open
[3:45:55] Navy_Mongoose: THERE ARE... TERRIBLE DEMONS
[3:46:11] ScholarofGames: Yes
[3:46:14] VentisVeilborne: basilNoted Serum, noted
[3:46:21] Navy_Mongoose: syrup, from the pantry
[3:46:55] UNSC_Saratoga: Never played this game but I loved RE2 remake and Operation: Raccoon City
[3:47:16] ScholarofGames: Well that's a first.
[3:47:17] Navy_Mongoose: hot take: I really dislike RE Outbreak
[3:47:37] ScholarofGames: I've never heard anyone say anything good about Operation: Raccoon City.
[3:47:54] Navy_Mongoose: probably fell over
[3:47:55] ScholarofGames: @Navy_Mongoose I'd like for that to get a remake honestly, I felt it came out too soon.
[3:48:04] UNSC_Saratoga: @scholarofgames I kinda liked it. It had its faults but it was fun
[3:48:09] VentisVeilborne: Isnt O:RC a 4 player Co-Op game?
[3:48:35] ScholarofGames: @UNSC_Saratoga Eh I can't blame you it's how I feel about RE6.
[3:48:54] UNSC_Saratoga: RE5 unfortunately suffered from the era it was made in. Washed out colors and weird writing and gameplay
[3:49:01] Navy_Mongoose: @VentisVeilborne yes. tbh I like the characters in this
[3:49:11] anonsama9001: capcom has been trying to conjure a successful RE multiplayer game for like two decades now and nothing sticks lel
[3:49:20] UNSC_Saratoga: @ventisveilborne It has a singleplayer campaign
[3:49:32] demon_dandy: I got back youre still up classic
[3:49:36] FranzNF: @UNSC_Saratoga missed the pissed filter era and went into the the "shitty blue tint" era
[3:49:42] MechaMozie: Are you winning son?
[3:49:46] ScholarofGames: I think Outbreak was pretty good.
[3:49:49] VentisVeilborne: @UNSC_Saratoga Ooo gotcha
[3:49:49] Navy_Mongoose: it wasn't multiplayer? was it just squad-based singleplayer then?
[3:50:14] ScholarofGames: @anonsama9001 RE5 was well received for the most part.
[3:50:16] anonsama9001: there were a couple on ps2 believe it or not, very similar to this style
[3:50:16] UNSC_Saratoga: @franznf That piss filter was just everywhere at the time. Couldn’t escape the piss
[3:50:16] demon_dandy: You got him yoooo ashton51Pog
[3:50:22] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:50:40] ScholarofGames: If you take too long.
[3:50:43] VentisVeilborne: Yeah, if you take too long
[3:50:45] demon_dandy: Yeah theres a chance you take too long ashton51Tehe
[3:50:45] Navy_Mongoose: you could take too long and he bleeds out
[3:50:55] xivandroid: snek
[3:51:41] anonsama9001: @ScholarofGames true, i more meant pvp vs co-op campaign

[3:55:22] demon_dandy: classic
[3:55:24] ScholarofGames: At least you can save him in this one.
[3:55:28] ScholarofGames: OG he just dies.
[3:55:38] MechaMozie: Maybe richard could walk it off?
[3:55:38] Navy_Mongoose: yeah he's a huge waste of time in the og
[3:55:43] InsaneLoke: hes fine]
[3:55:56] VentisVeilborne: He just stays there posted up for the rest of the game if you're too late
[3:56:10] InsaneLoke: she knows foreshadowing
[3:56:46] FranzNF: you got the piano notes, that's a start
[3:56:48] demon_dandy: ashton microdosing richard the serum so he keeps whimpering
[3:57:00] VentisVeilborne: Tru, the pit crew had you speeding to get the serum
[3:57:18] Navy_Mongoose: liar
