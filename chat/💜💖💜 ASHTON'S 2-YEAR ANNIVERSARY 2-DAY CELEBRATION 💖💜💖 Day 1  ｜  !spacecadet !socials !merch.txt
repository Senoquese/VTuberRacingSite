[3:32:57] mushi_buns: women hot and thats confusing
[3:33:02] vtuberacingcorp: I'm going to be real, everyone knows how disappointing anime romance feels. I've seen like a 100 of those for the hets. Yuri and Yaoi is no difference.
[3:33:09] Navy_Mongoose: !bomb
[3:33:12] JTBun: @JTBun 3rd one was meant to be 1000 oop

[3:33:42] Burr11: so many het anime dont have payoff either though its true
[3:33:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: 50 is solid
[3:33:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: 1 dollar gets 2 biggies which is fine
[3:34:05] Burr11: it just stings more when it's a minority type relationship
[3:34:10] GrandAM64: Chat, give me a good 2-digit number for use as a race number
[3:34:12] ReyJaggy: reiwa era is giving us good het manga
[3:34:14] horribleham: Ashton saying "I don't understand yuri, it just makes me flustered." Is pretty yuri.

[3:34:20] vtuberacingcorp: I think it's less that it's bait and more that it's easier to make the same no payoff stories for yuri and yaoi the hets get.

[3:35:14] demon_dandy: I swear i saw someone just played lsd
[3:35:16] horribleham: idk, some of it is more subtext than bait. Some people call Revstar bait but it's NOT. There is no straight explanation for the things that happen in that anime.
