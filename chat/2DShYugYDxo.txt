[1:41:12] Returner7: it's complicated
[1:41:13] rikkaonline: plot
[1:41:13] Navy_Mongoose: bowser is always kidnapping peach
[1:41:20] su_ki_da: Mario'sHouse
[1:41:24] InsaneLoke: that damn bowsah
[1:41:26] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:41:32] Senoquese: you look like this tiny in my head
[1:41:38] JTBun: ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly
[1:41:38] LapDanceDietrich: SUPER MARIOOOO URRRRR PEE GEEEEEEE
[1:41:43] Navy_Mongoose: I think Korone did the original in 3 streams
[1:41:44] LapDanceDietrich: ashton51Wiggly
[1:41:46] demon_dandy: 3 hour zatsu before every mario rpg ashton51Baby
[1:41:51] vy__yvas: the “that long”
[1:42:01] JTBun: normal
[1:42:02] Navy_Mongoose: 3-4 hours I think?
[1:42:05] rikkaonline: normal
[1:42:08] demon_dandy: Normal is fine
[1:42:12] demon_dandy: I think
[1:42:12] Navy_Mongoose: Normal, game is already super easy
[1:42:15] InsaneLoke: 10 hours
[1:42:19] vtuberacingcorp: How long to beat on this is 12 to 20 hours it looks like.
[1:42:20] rikkaonline: even normal on this is slightly easier than the original
[1:42:21] JTBun: yeah game isn't too hard
[1:42:22] demon_dandy: ashton51Dance ashton51Dance ashton51Dance
[1:42:25] su_ki_da: i believe in the strength of the chinciller
[1:42:27] su_ki_da: chinchiller
[1:42:47] Returner7: yeah yeah 32 hours for me because I was a kid and I sucked LOL
[1:43:02] Senoquese: i need to repost my mario rpg meme when this stream is over ashton51Tehe
[1:43:07] demon_dandy: All the NND meme music ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[1:43:23] Senoquese: i think it got buried last time i posted it
[1:43:29] LapDanceDietrich: I WAS NEVER BOOK SMART
[1:43:29] rikkaonline: this is better
[1:43:30] demon_dandy: Omori
[1:43:34] Returner7: I though it was undertale?
[1:43:39] Returner7: yeah fire emblem counts too
[1:43:47] Senoquese: MARIO PUNCH
[1:43:50] su_ki_da: PUNCH
[1:43:58] Returner7: oh yeah Omori on stream yeah
[1:44:00] su_ki_da: undertale counts
[1:44:01] Navy_Mongoose: Kind of not really
[1:44:03] Senoquese: ehhhhhhh
[1:44:04] Senoquese: not really
[1:44:07] JTBun: Mother is totally a RPG
[1:44:08] demon_dandy: Mother is definitelt an rpg
[1:44:09] su_ki_da: mother is an rpg?
[1:44:21] Burr11: lol yeah it's not its own genre ashton51Tehe
[1:44:27] rikkaonline: theyre similar in tone, not gameplay
[1:44:34] JTBun: they are very RPG, just have different style
[1:44:39] demon_dandy: Undertale is kinda an rpg but not typical turn-based combat
[1:44:42] Senoquese: they just have different combat styles
[1:44:43] Burr11: yeah its not like undertale
[1:44:46] su_ki_da: a lot of games now just take inspiration specifically from mother
[1:45:04] rowanfresh: what about that really wacky one you played with the guy with the moon head
[1:45:09] demon_dandy: Omori is closer to earthbound imo than undertale
[1:45:13] Returner7: I mean, yeah they're both turn based with more retro sensibilities
[1:45:16] demon_dandy: Hylics ashton51Tehe
[1:45:20] su_ki_da: different interactive styles and systems doesn't give it its own genre
[1:45:37] Senoquese: mario and sonic are both platformers despite playing really differently
[1:45:41] Senoquese: as an example
[1:45:42] su_ki_da: ^^^
[1:45:51] demon_dandy: Yeye
[1:45:56] Burr11: thats a weird distinction lol
[1:46:03] StreamElements: I am conducting a survey of my community to better understand your wants and needs! I would really appreciate if you took the time to fill it out, regardless of how long or how often you have been watching: https://forms.gle/Bp8HVPLbQGbqMBEMA
[1:46:13] su_ki_da: i get what you mean, but what you describe are subsets of a genre
[1:46:17] su_ki_da: like ARPG and JPRG
[1:46:21] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:46:28] JTBun: we are talking about vibes/style then, not genre
[1:46:35] Returner7: wait, so you're able to suspend more disbelief in a 2D environment is what you're saying?
[1:46:37] brewery__: happy ashton day!!!
[1:46:41] rikkaonline: 1up sound mean success
[1:46:44] Navy_Mongoose: yes, the 1-up noise means you landed it
[1:46:45] demon_dandy: Yeahnit made the sound ashton51Baby

[1:47:30] rowanfresh: so much for turn based
[1:47:34] rowanfresh: it's real time baby
[1:47:39] rikkaonline: theres a range to timing, a near miss is less effective
[1:47:43] demon_dandy: She has the just frames, shes insanneeee
[1:48:00] rowanfresh: chain chomp is my favourite tennis player after roger federer
[1:48:10] Navy_Mongoose: I think this game adds an extra layer to the timing, where you get a normal effect for hitting the window and a better effect for perfect timing
[1:48:21] Navy_Mongoose: @demon_dandy someone's playing GBVS
[1:48:27] su_ki_da: Fungah!
[1:48:30] Senoquese: you make a lot of noises
[1:48:33] demon_dandy: Just frame is a term that means you hit the button on the exact frame needed ashton51Tehe
[1:48:58] Returner7: Justice Frames!!!
[1:49:00] demon_dandy: exactlyyyyy ashton51Tensai

[1:50:19] Senoquese: mario was super experimental during this era, especially since this was more of a square game than nintendo
[1:50:25] demon_dandy: The lighting is scary ashton51Tehe
[1:50:26] asilveras: Albino blue eyes?
[1:50:28] rowanfresh: jeepers creepers where'd you get those peepers
[1:50:34] AkaiHomura: it seems like everyone is playing mario rpg on stream now
[1:50:35] Navy_Mongoose: its because he's so stout and pudgy, I don't think the designs tranferred over very well to the remake
[1:50:35] JTBun: eepy

[3:56:25] niertlwal: I can't tell you how  I knew - but I did know that I had crossed  The border. Everything I loved was lost  But no aorta could report regret.  A sun of rubber was convulsed and set;  And blood-black nothingness began to spin  A system of cells interlinked within  Cells interlinked within cells interlinked  Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct  Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.
