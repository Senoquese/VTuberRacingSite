[3:40:02] NadoPado: shamiaClap
[3:40:04] Bookethead: one of the monster designers did like working in sexual themes
[3:40:05] Senoquese: like 90% of the game isnt sexual but then they got a deranged developer that kept wanting to put genitals in the game LMAO
[3:40:06] Kitkattack: ashton51Tehe

[3:40:40] DingusMcBaseball: its all organic so
[3:40:45] Burr11: ya know
[3:40:48] EmrysEv: half life was originally gonna have a creature that looks like the front of a penis and the back of a horse and it would try and fuck Gordon to death
[3:40:51] NadoPado: There was even a cut enemy that was meant to violently copulate with its victims to kill them ashton51Stare
[3:40:51] Senoquese: oh i agree that those movies have sexual themes, but
[3:40:53] Senoquese: this guy just liked genitals
[3:40:57] Burr11: what are you even doing ashton51Tehe
[3:41:02] Senoquese: he was genuinely just deranged and the genitals had no meaning besides them being genitals
[3:41:21] 0SM0: rich imagination
[3:41:27] NadoPado: That cut creature's name was called Mr Friendly too kishin2LUL
[3:41:31] Burr11: lolll
[3:41:41] Senoquese: that stuff wasnt really valve but just one developer that got wayyyy too much leeway

[3:55:39] NadoPado: ladymo20Rave ladymo20Rave ladymo20Rave
[3:55:40] Playmer: They didn't they just wanted to try to fix it, and they tried by making them more "levely". Xen was rushed in the OG, they had years.

[3:58:10] zebrudda: @Senoquese Nothing really happens. You just walk around killing things until it ends. No real story beats. At least the expansions tried to get you to do stuff in Xen
[3:58:11] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe

[4:02:58] NadoPado: It gets even deeper than that but I won't say yet merppeComfy
[4:02:58] honktowndeluxe: You just did the human equivalent of "you live like this?"
[4:03:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Theres more lore in HL2 that explains this area
[4:03:11] Senoquese: xen is important as a location because it lets you travel to other dimensions thru it, but they dont live here
[4:03:15] Bookethead: the aliens are invaders to xen iirc
[4:03:16] 0SM0: You can see their drilling machines there
[4:03:16] anonsama9001: did you redeem this one seno?
[4:03:22] ReyJaggy: this is their skid row
[4:03:32] SurroundedByPerverts: I'm pretty sure a lot of these creatures are immigrants fleeing something worse.
[4:03:34] JTBun: @anonsama9001 no she played on her own
[4:03:34] X_Rok: it's a sort of halfway dimension between our world and theirs

[4:04:09] Cannonaire: @Senoquese Didn't know that! Neat.
[4:04:17] 0SM0: In a sense, Humans use Xen Crystals for teleportation.
[4:04:22] NadoPado: What Seno said, they're here for something that you'll probably find out from HL2 erosNodders
[4:04:32] X_Rok: i believe the alien forces set up here to use this as a staging ground for invading other worlds
[4:04:47] JTBun: yeah HL2 explains a lot
[4:05:00] zebrudda: "We were the aliens all along"
[4:05:09] honktowndeluxe: Iraq War 2
[4:05:15] Burr11: lol yeah
[4:05:21] mrp0p1nfr3sh: operation desert storm 1 in the 90s was about asset theft too ashi
[4:05:27] Cannonaire: @JTBman I've played through HL2 and its expansions several times, and I still don't remember hearing any of these explanations about Xen.
[4:05:39] SurroundedByPerverts: The United States has been going to war for resources since basically forever.

[4:14:35] Senoquese: this is meant to be a factory
[4:14:37] bossmarvellous: Yes
[4:14:41] Senoquese: and they care more about working than fighting you
[4:14:48] 0SM0: They are too occupied with working on those pods
[4:14:49] TheAsterite: chin-killa
[4:14:53] zebrudda: Yeah the vorts. The other ones still attack on sight
[4:15:06] bossmarvellous: 🤣
[4:15:07] itshardnottocheat: it's more like these are just workers and you just walked in like an osha member

[4:17:11] Bookethead: they're being forced to by the controllers
[4:17:33] itshardnottocheat: it's more like those flying aliens are the foreman and they are telling the workers to kill on sight
[4:17:58] 0SM0: There are multiple alien machines they are forced to work on,  I thought it was obvious, sorry for spoiling
[4:18:07] zebrudda: Gordon entering the factory and killing the foreman like he's about to read the communist manifesto outloud
[4:18:36] Senoquese: in the other room, if you hurt them theyd try to flee to the healing pods
[4:18:53] zebrudda: @Senoquese Yeah that's actually really sad
[4:19:03] Senoquese: LOL
