[1:13:53] Rhounyn: My brain messed up the numbers
[1:13:56] pogotross: fantastic four is just kind of a lame IP
[1:14:05] DavidPortnov: They're revealing too much in the trailers for F4.
[1:14:17] Senoquese: @pogotross supermans like the most boring superhero and they made it work
[1:14:19] buruhas: I loved the colorful bright orange furniture in Superman ashton51Love
[1:14:20] Playmer: @DavidPortnov To be fair, I thought this about Superman.
[1:14:23] ReyJaggy: Maybe cause you went blind to superman but f4 you are already aware how the movie will look from the trailers
[1:14:26] Rhounyn: @DavidPortnov That's why I don't watch many trailers
[1:14:41] pingufrend: trailers felt like u had to be a fan already to want to watch it.
[1:14:45] pogotross: @Senoquese Superman is boring because he's vanilla, FF is boring because everything they do is done better elsewhere

[1:17:19] DavidPortnov: I love when they cast actors I wouldn't initially think of.
[1:17:53] InsaneLoke: yeah i agree though i wish they pushed the retro style more but im grateful its even at this amount
[1:18:13] pingufrend: deh-chin

[1:22:40] britbongreptile: I only remember the odyssey and predator
[1:22:40] Rhounyn: Gal Gadot was a model so maybe that has something to do with it
[1:23:13] Navy_Mongoose: Marvel has Spiderman so it's cooler by default
[1:23:15] T33bags: yo
[1:23:17] spikebomb5: they should make a martian manhunter movie, could be really good
[1:23:40] yojamjam: oooo i forgot about snotgirl
[1:23:44] DavidPortnov: Snotgirl is supposed to be pretty good. It's Bryan Lee O'Malley comic I think.
[1:23:47] Senoquese: @yojamjam shes on screen rn
[1:23:47] sksmaltz: they be kinda meh
[1:23:49] Navy_Mongoose: add it to the movie night
[1:23:50] demon_dandy: Thatd be a fun discord watch
[1:23:55] dynamozx05: It's ok if you like marvel because Ironman x Capn America, you can say It out loud here
[1:23:57] b19boss: Hellow
[1:24:00] th31r0nhand: That ad for the predator movie looked so uninteresting
[1:24:05] Red__2: All the post thanos stuff has just been slowly leaked to me via YT shorts
[1:24:10] Senoquese: marvel got way more potential that they waste
[1:24:13] Burr11: nah i feel that
[1:24:18] Lord_Scrublet: i kind of agree
[1:24:25] HelloImRagan: oh i dont think thats controversial at all
[1:24:29] spikebomb5: marvel is 80% wasted potential

[1:24:48] sksmaltz: dc can focus more with less, marvel has too many so they focus on the big names
[1:24:51] Lord_Scrublet: my favorite comic heroes are Zatanna and Booster Gold but i prefer the avengers over most of the justice league
[1:24:53] th31r0nhand: Mr Terrific was so cool
[1:24:57] ScarletRook: Hall of Justice!
[1:25:00] demon_dandy: Mister terrific from what ive seen oozes cool tbf
[1:25:02] Kitkattack: a perm?
[1:25:04] Rhounyn: Funny thing, Iron Man wasn't such a popular dude before the movies
[1:25:05] britbongreptile: he stole every scene for me
[1:25:09] pingufrend: thats so true woah
[1:25:15] DavidPortnov: This Superman movie kind of reminded me of the Arrowverse, but with an actual budget.
[1:25:18] InsaneLoke: black slick back hair is out of modern style
[1:25:23] st3vnx25: Cool
[1:25:30] spikebomb5: its just execution imo
[1:25:34] Rhounyn: So maybe marvel is just bad at promoting their minor heroes
[1:25:35] pingufrend: black widows movie made me laugh
[1:25:40] Kitkattack: I'm an enormous fan of the Blade movies
[1:25:40] th31r0nhand: I would love a Dr. Fate movie
[1:25:42] bvmmer: nooooo :(
[1:25:45] th31r0nhand: Like, a good one
[1:25:45] ScarletRook: Ok now you're not cooking
[1:25:45] KoKinetik: gasp
[1:25:49] DavidPortnov: Fair based on the movies.
[1:25:50] Navy_Mongoose: The only good thing about X-Men was the animate series
[1:25:50] Senoquese: waitt but you kinda a mutant rodent thing yourself
[1:25:50] bvmmer: i love them all
[1:25:53] Rhounyn: What made me interested on X-men was the cartoons
[1:25:54] 葉梓杰: doobyLove doobyLove
[1:25:56] DavidPortnov: I love them in the comics though.
[1:25:58] Red__2: Days of future past cooked
[1:26:00] dynamozx05: The X-Men animated series are fire tho
[1:26:02] Rhounyn: the movies were alright by the time
[1:26:14] spikebomb5: its cuz marvel chose some of the more lame characters and focused on 'realism'
[1:26:25] demon_dandy: i get it with some but the hhitters in x men are home runs, like magneto and wolverine
[1:26:31] Senoquese: thats true
[1:26:37] ScarletRook: Like the X-Men were the A-team. Their supporting cast is supposed to be full of the good ones in Marvel
[1:26:43] Navy_Mongoose: nobody gave a fuck about Iron Man or Guardians until the MCU
[1:27:06] DavidPortnov: @navy_mongoose Exactly.
[1:27:13] Senoquese: marvel used to take way more risks back and movies would turn out awesome
[1:27:19] Senoquese: back then*
[1:27:24] Rhounyn: DC made a lot mistakes and seem to finally be finding their path now
[1:27:25] demon_dandy: Yeah blade still rules
[1:27:26] Playmer: @Navy_Mongoose I had straight up never heard of Guardians before the movie.
[1:27:28] ScarletRook: Yeah like Deadpool is a parody of one of DC's characters
[1:27:38] Playmer: But I mean, Iron Man was known.
[1:27:42] HelloImRagan: part of that is because marvel defined itself as the more realistic comic company back in the 70s in order to seperate itself from DC
[1:27:43] Playmer: Slader/Deathstroke
[1:27:43] dynamozx05: Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (the first animated series of Avengers) was great too
[1:27:45] Rhounyn: Slade?
[1:27:52] Playmer: Slade
[1:27:53] phatscout: Deathstroke
[1:27:53] Lord_Scrublet: guardians 3 is arguably one of my favorite mainstream films ever
[1:27:57] Playmer: Slader was a typo
[1:27:57] demon_dandy: Gotg trilogy dont miss
[1:27:57] phatscout: AKA Slade
[1:27:57] DavidPortnov: Guardians was a great trilogy. His Suicide Squad was great too.
[1:27:58] th31r0nhand: I still haven't seen the third guardians movie, but the other two are really good
[1:27:59] spikebomb5: teen titans guy
[1:28:02] Navy_Mongoose: Iron Man was definitely known, but apparently he was pretty unpopular for a while
[1:28:03] Rhounyn: ^
[1:28:05] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[1:28:06] HelloImRagan: ywa
[1:28:07] Senoquese: yes
[1:28:07] demon_dandy: Yeye
[1:28:08] Rhounyn: Teen titans indeed
[1:28:08] DavidPortnov: Slade Wilson
[1:28:09] ScarletRook: yes
[1:28:12] DavidPortnov: Yes
[1:28:18] spikebomb5: the groomer
[1:28:19] DavidPortnov: They just called him Slade
[1:28:21] sksmaltz: slade/deathstroke is like deadpool but serious lol
[1:28:22] Rhounyn: The similarities are obvious
[1:28:25] dynamozx05: Slade was the main bad guy in the first Teen Titans animated series
[1:28:33] olandgren: he’s the character Deadpool was written to make fun of
[1:28:34] Lord_Scrublet: i think the creator of deadpool has actually denied the character being a parody of deathstroke though
[1:28:36] phatscout: yeah deadpool is a parody of the bad guy from teen titans that ron perlman voiced
[1:28:46] Rhounyn: I used to mistake both characters lol

[3:06:09] JTBun: yeah
[3:06:15] buruhas: Wants to be a pretty princess, wants to be the assertive one, wants to be girly...
[3:06:19] rikkaonline: if someone thinks that masculine, then theyre a pass
[3:06:19] DatBoiVLC: its kinda old fashioned crungo misogyny to insist that being dominant is masc
[3:06:31] th31r0nhand: It's about the confidence
[3:06:35] Lord_Scrublet: what datboiVLC said
[3:06:38] Reeser_Rat: femme fatale characters are dominant and assertive while being very obviously feminine
[3:06:39] rikkaonline: they are not at odds
[3:06:40] demon_dandy: I think its more your willingness to banter that can come off as smooth
[3:06:42] JTBun: yeah dom doesnt mean masc
[3:06:42] MostPerfectPenguin: a "strong woman" can most definitely be feminine. And intimidating. Nothing exclusive about that

[3:41:17] synthesis034: that one seems more vanilla though
[3:41:18] MostPerfectPenguin: ...that's freakier than mpreg!?
[3:41:23] yojamjam: ohhhh voyeurism has come up before
[3:41:26] shindigs: when the streamer becomes the viewer...
[3:41:29] a_raccoon27: I was kinda tuned out but snapped back in at "butt pregnant"
[3:41:30] Rhounyn: I heard enough about Mpreg in vtubing to find it "normal"
[3:41:33] rikkaonline: fiction is basically voyeurism anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:41:34] jdoncena: mpreg is a once in a blue moon thing lmao
[3:41:35] DatBoiVLC: voyeurism/exhibitionism gets pretty freaky imo

[3:41:52] Lord_Scrublet: "Everyone wants to know what the fujo stuff is until its you getting butt preg" is maybe the greatest quote i have heard on stream ever
[3:41:55] demon_dandy: ashton51Thinky
[3:41:59] jdoncena: at least its not going into gore/scat territory
[3:42:03] Ortintzki: Her fetishes are beyond the understanding of mortal humans.
[3:42:05] Senoquese: i gotta repost that exhibitionist ashton art for all the new chillas
[3:42:16] rikkaonline: yeah tbh this isnt really weird
[3:42:18] demon_dandy: ICANT
[3:42:29] Lord_Scrublet: gore is a HARD no for me
[3:42:32] yojamjam: BALLS
[3:42:33] jdoncena: @Senoquese 👀
[3:42:36] Koma_Inuhiko: I think voyuerism has been waning as it has gotten inundated with the NTR... and suddenly anything with infidelity is mistagged as NTR
[3:42:42] Rhounyn: Voyeurism in the balls lol
[3:43:02] MostPerfectPenguin: @shindigs for my own sanity, it has to be more normal then ;-;
[3:43:03] yojamjam: tossed like a pizza pie
[3:43:14] mr_reedster: Hello
[3:43:25] managerkun_: NTR  IS Cuckolding
[3:43:30] Ortintzki: I think NTR and cuckolding the partner being cheated on is more involved in the act.
[3:43:36] jdoncena: after this stream you’ll hate tentacles lol
[3:43:36] rikkaonline: lol
[3:43:37] Senoquese: cuckholding is being into it, ntr is like the bf is crying
[3:43:40] Koma_Inuhiko: infidelity is just cheating, the third party member is not really involved. Oh shutting up now
[3:43:43] Lord_Scrublet: VALID
[3:43:48] Rhounyn: damn, sorry for bringing NTR into the discussion LUL
[3:43:49] synthesis034: cuckholding can be consensual
[3:43:52] strawberryspinachpizza: I see...
[3:43:57] shindigs: saying NTR instead of cuckolding is like when you substitute the japanese anime title for the english one
[3:43:59] yojamjam: bro just walked up and asked and got in
[3:44:01] MostPerfectPenguin: good call, we were spiraling
[3:44:04] th31r0nhand: I think it's the emotions attached to it. NTR specifically is about the shame of it
[3:44:06] demon_dandy: ICANT
[3:44:08] jdoncena: hahahahaa
[3:44:16] themaestroplaysgames: NTR emphasizes the humiliation
[3:44:22] Koma_Inuhiko: Can you even dodge in this game?
[3:44:37] Lord_Scrublet: i have plenty of shame i dont need anymore XD

[3:45:01] MostPerfectPenguin: what's the use for shame? that's my parents' job!
[3:45:06] demon_dandy: It is kinda a bm moveset
[3:45:09] AlexDD00: Infidelity is just cheating. Cuckolding is agreeing to it. I feel like NTR has an element of the partner moving on to the other person/ being "stolen"
[3:45:18] kinkonsito: ashhtom
[3:45:23] Lord_Scrublet: bad manners
[3:45:23] yojamjam: BABY MAMA MOVESET om

[5:21:57] demon_dandy: I kinda like this puzzle
[5:22:01] ScholarofGames: It's the most infamous puzzle in the series.
[5:22:13] ScholarofGames: Or at least the trilogy.
[5:22:14] Senoquese: you shouldnt have said anything i can now hear the loop ICANT
[5:22:17] chinwillach: Ask anyone what the worst puzzle in RE is you're gonna hear this one a lot

[5:23:31] ScholarofGames: This is the one puzzle I feel no shame just looking up the answer for since doing it normally can possible take way too long.
[5:23:41] demon_dandy: Almosttt
[5:24:09] TheUnnamedSaveFile: i think thats it?

[5:26:13] Ortintzki: It's a little funny.
[5:26:25] InsaneLoke: trick tuah
[5:26:25] Senoquese: i wish you could just drag your hand through those 3 sliders at once
[5:26:38] Senoquese: instead of 1 by 1
[5:26:44] TheUnnamedSaveFile: the puzzle and looping sound is the challenge
