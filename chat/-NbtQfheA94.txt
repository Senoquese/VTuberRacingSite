[1:36:30] SolAzul42: Conversely the N64 has barely any games
[1:36:31] Kitkattack: @SolAzul42 my little brother adores Kirby, I totally would if I had the hardware
[1:36:44] caratecaa: Proportionally it's probably atari or n64 but DS is the champion by numbers.
[1:36:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The wii came after nintendo released its grips on the nintendo seal of quality and thats why you had shovelware on that system
[1:36:49] TheAsterite: n64 no jrpgs tho

[1:37:35] Navy_Mongoose: nope, Quest 64 is one of the few RPGs on N64 and it was bad
[1:37:36] TheElfiestElf: ... what the
[1:37:36] ZippiBelfast: Quest 64 is just a random jrpg, not related to DQ
[1:37:43] TheElfiestElf: no Dragon Quest is not sega
