[2:09:06] Senoquese: i tried to make a discord for my community agees ago and that was one of my biggest mistakes. i have like no positive memories about that LMAO
[2:09:12] BaakaMitaiiTV: Im super hesitant to ban anyone cause i always get the feeling like im being mean at that point.
[2:09:34] demon_dandy: @senoquese that makes me sad seno ashton51Tehe
[2:09:46] Burr11: ashton51Tehe

[2:10:06] LapDanceDietrich: put your balls on the table and put your foot down
[2:10:16] Egmanila: But the children wanna play Bed Wars with you ashton51Squish
[2:10:20] ReyJaggy: i dont know how mods do it, i would feel bad banning any first offenders.
[2:10:25] Burr11: this community is strong.. we'll be fine even with some bad apples coming by once in a while
[2:10:40] Returner7: ^^^
[2:11:06] DatBoiVLC: This was very fun ashton51Stare even at 10 seconds per frame
[2:11:10] Burr11: i've been a mod in communities before.. my attitude is usually to give baddies enough rope to hang themselves and then act decisively
[2:11:13] BaakaMitaiiTV: I had to be blunt and just get in to the mindset of "I need to be more strict to enforce rules and such" and then proceeded to do 5 mod duties in like 30 minutes LMAO
[2:11:15] demon_dandy: I like to do warning shot then its like that pic "no goku we really gotta kill em.."
[2:11:19] Senoquese: its so easy a viewer to complain about other annoying people but as a mod id immediately shatter and not actually do anything
[2:11:28] JTBun: I modded for like 5+ years, so I got over that feeling ashton51Tehe
[2:11:35] rsarv810: you can do reflections

[2:12:31] BaakaMitaiiTV: Once you do your first mod action, you really lose the feeling of being mean after once you understand why it had to happen in the first place
[2:12:51] Burr11: lol
[2:12:58] Senoquese: im staying as a vip, i feel like as a mod id have to act as a role model and stop typing the delusional shit that makes me beloved
[2:13:02] rsarv810: dude would be bad cop
[2:13:15] LapDanceDietrich: stop being gay to be mod smh could never
[2:13:15] ReyJaggy: eds would make lil creepy drawings of every chilla he bans
[2:13:21] imnoteds: i would time out seno and jtb everytime they get flirty
[2:13:28] Playmer: With the various places I’ve modded unless it’s a clear and egregious breach we discuss it in the mod channel.

[2:17:48] BaakaMitaiiTV: piapiuPopcorn
[2:17:52] ReyJaggy: brain worms
[2:17:53] DatBoiVLC: Getting a "fuck you, VLC" is a badge of pride for me.  However I don't wanna work for it here :3
[2:17:55] rsarv810: beri is incapable of being mean, it is likewise impossible to be mean to her (without crippling guilt)
