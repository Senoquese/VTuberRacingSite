[1:18:21] c_v_catullus16: I never noticed until recently, but I'm beginning to notice how Sonic Adventure was influenced by other 3D platformer games released around the same time; especially with the use of hub worlds and portal stage windows in the game.

[1:26:36] TheElfiestElf: bear...bone... so Baldur's Gate 3?
[1:26:40] itsSwimm: that's... concerning. but okay :D
[1:26:40] LucasEpicVT: I remember when Banjo Kazooie came out. People played it but it wasn't super popular, it was seen as just another N64 game. Today however it has quite a cult following.
[1:26:46] c_v_catullus16: I think a lot of later Platformer games got a bit too serious at times. One of the few exceptions I've seen is Portal 2.
[1:26:46] Bookethead: switchXL
[1:26:49] horribleham: back to the 3ds I hope
[1:27:01] InsaneLoke: just the switch but more powerful so basically the 3DS Pro

[1:27:22] itsSwimm: New Super Nintendo 3DSwitch LL XL U
[1:27:26] Senoquese: didnt the 3ds sell horribly for a while
[1:27:32] JTBun: nahhhh
[1:27:39] JTBun: they made bank
[1:27:39] c_v_catullus16: There a bit like Lego in that case.
[1:27:40] rikkaonline: iirc nintendo has a large cash reserve
[1:27:41] pogotross: Nah, they have like 50 years of cash stored away
[1:27:42] Bookethead: idk how they're going to compete with the steamdeck since it can play switch games
[1:27:44] kyle__senpai: @senoquese CEO took a pay cut because of it
[1:27:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese that was the DS yeah 3ds was their best seller
[1:27:48] ganondorfongolf: Don't nintendo have tons of money stored in their coffers?
[1:27:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it sold FOREVER
[1:27:58] Unpronounceable: I've actually heard they could survive multiple WiiU scale failures
[1:28:01] Navy_Mongoose: remember Iwata took a pay cut because the WiiU sold so poorly
[1:28:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i did a hydrate redeem.
[1:28:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: fyi
[1:28:07] rikkaonline: if it gets rough they can just churn out more zeldas. look at pokemon, its garbage but still makes tons of profit
[1:28:10] kyle__senpai: @mrp0p1nfr3sh no way, DS was a hit from the start
[1:28:11] JTBun: they won't, Wii U wasn't horrible, just kinda dumb and overlooked by most
[1:28:21] InsaneLoke: they do
[1:28:28] InsaneLoke: they made sea of thieves lol
[1:28:29] Navy_Mongoose: Rare just Microsoft I think
[1:28:29] itsSwimm: oh Rare's still around under Microsoft, they mostly work on Sea of Thieves
[1:28:36] itsSwimm: yeah LOL
[1:28:45] c_v_catullus16: Lego Group needs to commission an amazing crafting-survival game to compete with Minecraft.
[1:28:45] kyle__senpai: @jtbun people didn't know that it was its own console at first. Thought it was another peripheral.
[1:28:45] demon_dandy: she joyc-on my switch till im lite headed
[1:28:55] JTBun: @kyle__senpai yup!
[1:29:06] ganondorfongolf: Rare the company still exists, but I'm pretty sure all the devs from the golden age don't work there anymore
[1:29:10] Navy_Mongoose: Sea Of Thieves is fun but I wish there was more to it
[1:29:10] InsaneLoke: sea of thieves is great, if it had a proper active multiplayer scene
[1:29:11] kyle__senpai: -10 years
[1:29:13] Senoquese: if you did play those games back then you wouldnt be a vtuber and streaming for us!
[1:29:16] demon_dandy: @senoquese she joyc-on my switch till im lite headed!!! I GOT IT
[1:29:17] T33bags: this was like late 90s ashton
[1:29:22] itsSwimm: when it was 2008, i was too busy being an ignorant child instead of investing in the market
[1:29:23] rikkaonline: the best time to play this maybe have been in 2000, but the seconds best time is right now
[1:29:43] Navy_Mongoose: This game was released when video games were $50
[1:29:52] c_v_catullus16: Would you be interested in trying the Sonic Adventure games?
[1:29:58] Bookethead: tbh I only watched stranger things for that, the repetitive monster story is so boring to me
[1:29:58] Kitkattack: I couldn't stand Ready Player One bcause of that, just a stupid nostalgia trip
[1:30:00] kyle__senpai: Tbh games in 2008 already started to suck
[1:30:06] Senoquese: youd love sonic adventure lmao
[1:30:17] LucasEpicVT: Rare is a curious case. It started indie in the 80s got bought by Nintendo in the 90s, then it got sold to Microsoft in the 2000s, so we got to see Rare games on the XBox, like Killer Instincts
[1:30:22] demon_dandy: Seein ashton play sonic adventure would be a trip ashton51Tehe
[1:30:34] Senoquese: its jank but its really funny

[1:30:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Cuz it gives you both styles
[1:30:46] kyle__senpai: Sonic Advance 2 id say
[1:30:46] itsSwimm: hmmm... probably Sonic Advance
[1:30:48] c_v_catullus16: Clearly not a reference to the John Williams Jaws theme.
[1:30:48] horribleham: sonic adventure 2 because it has the chao garden
[1:30:48] Zerorush: Sonic generations
[1:30:48] Bookethead: sonic 06 of course
[1:30:49] LucasEpicVT: Sonic CD

[1:31:27] demon_dandy: Sonic adventure 1 is tough, sonic adventure 2 has sonic and shadows so its good
[1:31:27] rsarv810: D:
[1:31:27] Zerorush: Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast feels really good. The GameCube version gave it a bad rep for being buggy and hard to control

[1:31:35] Navy_Mongoose: 4 hours of chao abuse? That's it?
[1:31:35] c_v_catullus16: Sonic Adventure 2 is a favorite game for speed runners. The chaos are a fun side game for the series.
[1:31:38] T33bags: oh yeah and sonadow yaoi

[4:15:13] OzneZone: Hope u get better
[4:15:16] SiixVTuber: it was good! i played drawy which is basically skriblio but with twitch chat :D

[4:16:21] wwwewwyn: ...could do you so much that you could do anything?
[4:16:44] demon_dandy: New ashton sound ashton51Pog
[4:16:55] SiixVTuber: ive also never played banjo kazooie so this is my first time seeing gameplay of it siixvtPeek
[4:17:00] mindofnarwhal: i used to be so scared of those
[4:17:26] LAGzillaaa: stop you're making me feel ancient oh god
[4:17:29] itsSwimm: ive played banjo. this doesnt really contribute to the discussion, i just wanna brag about controlling the bear and bird
[4:17:31] ApocalypseSC: ashton51Pog
[4:17:40] ApocalypseSC: easy games easy life the 90s were so easy
[4:17:43] SpookySkeleBloke: I feel like you're setting up Siix for a bad time.
[4:17:45] SiixVTuber: i quit replaying mario 64 lately because of the awful ancient camera LUL
[4:17:52] Navy_Mongoose: it's like if Mario 64 got upgraded controls and way upgraded difficulty
[4:17:55] Llwellyng: 98 is more recent than i thought
[4:17:56] LAGzillaaa: Z targeting EVERYTHING...
[4:18:26] Navy_Mongoose: Camera is great when you keep it centered
[4:18:29] Llwellyng: guh huh - HIM
[4:18:34] motaberrie: :) its soo good
[4:18:40] mindofnarwhal: perfect camera system
[4:18:55] LAGzillaaa: i also never played banjo & kazooie, i only ever watched clips c:
[4:19:10] itsSwimm: Hot take (ignore the username), but the swimming controls are actually pretty good in this game. Since you're able to swim at different speeds, its easy to grab items underwater.
[4:19:18] itsSwimm: AT LEAST TO ME
[4:19:33] Navy_Mongoose: ^
[4:19:40] Navy_Mongoose: Turning is easier when you hold A instead of B
[4:20:06] mindofnarwhal: ive played through every banjo kazooie game they are painful at times
[4:20:08] demon_dandy: I think the speed looks frustrating tbh
[4:20:17] LAGzillaaa: all that dookie water though.
[4:20:46] T33bags: JINJO!
[4:20:52] Xuang101: Hello Ashton, you cutie

[4:21:34] mindofnarwhal: @xuang101 its true it happend to me
[4:21:35] Xuang101: Because some levels are hard I
[4:22:04] ganondorfongolf: This isn't the hardest game in the world, but I've heard that some parts can get really annoying.
[4:22:04] Xuang101: I think your not suppose to play this game straight lol probably a save for a reason
[4:22:19] mindofnarwhal: banjo kazooie nuts and bolts made me wanna cry
[4:22:44] demon_dandy: I never finished banjo cause as a kid i was always like "mmm babby game or epic zelda ashton51Sip
[4:22:44] mindofnarwhal: yeah
[4:22:46] nullnug: i enjoy nuts n bolts beribugClap
[4:23:06] mindofnarwhal: but i lack creativity so i suck at building ;-;
[4:23:18] InsaneLoke: no lol
[4:23:19] Xuang101: If it's a baby game why do you keep losing?
[4:23:29] Navy_Mongoose: Nuts and Bolts is a fine game, but it's not a platformer
[4:23:29] RycegoZ: Nuts and Bolts kinda sucks compared to the OG 2

[4:23:51] Navy_Mongoose: there's also one on the GBA
[4:23:56] ganondorfongolf: If Nuts n Bolts wasn't a Banjo game it would have been received a lot better I think.
[4:24:03] InsaneLoke: alright time to lay down
[4:24:06] demon_dandy: Yeah i feel that
[4:24:06] InsaneLoke: !lurk
[4:24:07] StreamElements: InsaneLoke is a sneaky squeaky lurky lil mouse!
[4:24:15] demon_dandy: nini loke ashton51Baby
[4:24:31] InsaneLoke: ill be here in the shadows
[4:24:38] nullnug: play tooie. nuts n bolts is a completely different game. you wont like it just cause you like banjo. you'd have to happen to like it on its own
[4:24:45] demon_dandy: This shark is really cool and freaky
[4:25:05] demon_dandy: Yeah ive heard people very split on tooie
[4:25:30] T33bags: guh huh!
[4:25:34] Navy_Mongoose: normally you shoot that with eggs, but so long as you attack it it opens
[4:25:39] mindofnarwhal: tbh i love every banjo game
[4:25:51] nullnug: tooie is much bigger. levels are even more complicated. between this game and tooie, a lot of people prefer this game's "simplicity" (by comparison)
[4:25:54] SpookySkeleBloke: Yooka Laylee's sequel is supposed to be good.
[4:26:01] demon_dandy: Yooka laylee is like spiritual successor thst ended up bein meh
[4:26:12] Navy_Mongoose: Tooie has a darker tone and a lot more backtracking people weren't a fan of
[4:26:24] ApocalypseSC: i think i have yooka laylee is it worth playing?
[4:27:03] Navy_Mongoose: I saw my friend playing Tooie first as Mumbo, so I was surprised to see he's so freaking huge in the first game
[4:27:31] mindofnarwhal: i dont think ive ever seen content about any of the banjo kazooie games on twitch
[4:27:46] demon_dandy: ninoegICANT
