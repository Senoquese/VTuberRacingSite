[1:36:10] EdaLouisVT: funny how they're afraid but dont mind going up to it for melee attacks LOL
[1:36:22] chinwillach: The existence of the remakes means Geno fans can finally play his game ashton51Stare
[1:37:15] Navy_Mongoose: As in "Earthbounds biggest fan excited to play it for the first time"
[1:37:29] JTBun: @Navy_Mongoose LMAO
[1:37:38] chinwillach: @Navy_Mongoose Yea this lol
[1:37:45] LapDanceDietrich: well the game cartridge itself costs 80bucks on ebay and complete with box we talking like 300+ LMFAO
[1:38:14] nullnug: yea geno doesnt really do anything in this game, people just assumed he was an important character because of all the "geno for smash" stuff
[1:38:16] horribleham: Absolutely
[1:38:21] horribleham: Some games you can only get emulated
[1:38:28] chinwillach: Yea like Mother 3 which will most likely NEVER be released here

[1:39:59] chinwillach: @rikkaonline I compare it to the Sans debacle just on a much smaller scale
[1:40:10] nullnug: @rikkaonline there's no hate. there was just a big gap in wut people who never played the game assumed him to be because of all the hype around him
[1:40:13] Navy_Mongoose: It doesnt go on much longer though

[1:47:58] Navy_Mongoose: I dont think you can softlock out of anything in the remake
[1:48:19] chinwillach: I think you'd like M&L for sure
[1:48:20] Cobalt_Ordinaire: the series is REALLY good
