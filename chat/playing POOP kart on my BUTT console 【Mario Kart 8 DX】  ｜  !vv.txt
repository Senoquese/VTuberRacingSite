[3:24:36] JoeyG828: @rikkaonline reallll I finally put some of my favorite posters and wall art framed recently, it feels so good.
[3:24:55] farpadarp: Wall candy mmm mm
[3:24:55] holomybaby: I need to buy more frames for my signed cards 🤔
[3:25:08] Kitkattack: that's a pretty awful thing to say
[3:25:10] InsaneLoke: damn ur getting mario karted hard
[3:25:20] analog_demonic_kangaroo: Growing up is about not caring what others think about your hobbies. As long as it isnt hurting anyone
[3:25:26] xc_Zeno: Mario Kart vortex is real
[3:25:35] Kitkattack: imagine their parents telling them they couldn't have a madonna poster
[3:25:41] Navy_Mongoose: normal is shit though
[3:25:42] JoeyG828: That’s my mom, even now. It sucks because it’s your mother. :/
[3:25:54] Kitkattack: like it's not for them right
[3:25:59] farpadarp: Nah, plaster those walls with anime feet
[3:26:13] InsaneLoke: i was never allowed to put stuff on the wall at my parents so it feels adult finally hanging posters up
[3:26:15] Navy_Mongoose: You mean I have to act a certain way to fit in with genuinely awful people? fuck that
[3:26:18] analog_demonic_kangaroo: Ma'am, im in my 30s and i still talk passionately about my hobbies and interests\
[3:27:03] HashiriyaR32: Y BATT NO CHARGE!?
[3:27:07] Senoquese: i get that, my mom really doesnt like my ashton merch and insults me for it but at the same time she will remind me to add the ouioui to the ashton corner ICANT

[3:27:58] HashiriyaR32: oh no....
[3:28:00] Kitkattack: it's one thing if you have strangers at your house constantly
[3:28:13] pogotross: at some point I realized my grandparent's house was covered in western/cowboy stuff because they were westaboos and I stopped caring
[3:28:23] holomybaby: I suppose the question is why are you having strangers over that think your interests suck ass
[3:28:25] InsaneLoke: my guests WILL have to look at my yaoi poster
[3:28:36] HashiriyaR32: I have a USB hub (charging only) on my desk that I plug my phone and other items into

[3:29:00] Kitkattack: yeah but strangers, like someone you don't want to explain your Roberu wallscroll to
[3:29:11] Kitkattack: HAHAHA you cannot say "dog bed" in this context
[3:29:21] laser3365: I felt that.....
[3:29:28] Kitkattack: "I made them sleep on my dog bed" hahaha
[3:29:36] InsaneLoke: i think the dog bed had good context
[3:29:45] InsaneLoke: even if it was a small one
[3:29:53] Daniel_Ivey01: LOL
[3:29:55] HashiriyaR32: You hit a shell attached to him
[3:30:02] InsaneLoke: bumping with the shell on da back
[3:30:09] Kitkattack: well we know she doesn't mean an actual little dog bed on the ground
[3:30:11] analog_demonic_kangaroo: funnily enough there is a human sized dog bed you can buy

[3:31:24] yojamjam: that good tomb style sleep
[3:31:57] JoeyG828: I love a nice cold sleep with my six pillows.
[3:31:58] farpadarp: Idols are idols not friends

[3:37:43] InsaneLoke: most the time that is
[3:38:06] Senoquese: i was chill w u until u told me u killed that guy
[3:38:17] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese i get that alot personally
[3:38:20] analog_demonic_kangaroo: parasocial?
[3:38:26] farpadarp: Don't wanna see too much behind the curtain
[3:38:36] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke as the killer?
[3:38:36] xc_Zeno: my friend became a VTuber :P
[3:38:46] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese as the twitter user
[3:38:48] UF7351k2: I just suck as socializing in general
[3:38:48] JTBun: @Senoquese dude wtf why are you saying this publicly... thought we were still planning that
[3:38:52] demon_dandy: she fucking hates usssss ashton51Despair
[3:39:11] Navy_Mongoose: I get it
[3:39:12] Senoquese: the lack of professional respect?
[3:39:14] analog_demonic_kangaroo: vtuber you vs IRL you?
[3:39:19] Envivii: that's gross
[3:39:30] JoeyG828: That makes sense.
[3:39:33] xc_Zeno: yeah, it's funny how they treat someone once they get a new title
[3:39:45] MorgiTime: That's real. The idea of a person vs the actual person
[3:39:54] farpadarp: That's certainly a way to put it
[3:39:55] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its hard to make friends as streamers/vtubers
[3:39:55] InsaneLoke: mmmm yummy streamer
[3:39:56] ShiftedClock: i will consume ashton
[3:40:03] Motii07: exemEat yummy
[3:40:03] Envivii: i think when there's someone you look up to, you construct an image of them in your head that's not, can't be, the real them
[3:40:04] Navy_Mongoose: it must be a very difficult line to walk
[3:40:05] JoeyG828: Eating the streamer, yes.
[3:40:05] InsaneLoke: starts consuming streamer
[3:40:19] SerenRenity_: yeah i like distance between me and my oshis
[3:40:24] farpadarp: Oh friends are messy as hell
[3:40:37] SaltsAndSpices: hi parasocialist here can confirm i both want to and not want to get closer to my oshi
[3:40:42] ShiftedClock: entertainers
[3:40:54] analog_demonic_kangaroo: as a introvert. Making friends and maintaining friendships is hard
[3:40:54] rikkaonline: nah its reasonable
[3:40:55] JoeyG828: She’s gonna eat us, chat!
[3:41:00] Senoquese: yes
[3:41:01] Navy_Mongoose: we getting deep and philisophical tonight
[3:41:02] InsaneLoke: you are saying very normal things
[3:41:03] SerenRenity_: it does to me!
[3:41:04] Envivii: yea it does
[3:41:04] DinoWyno: yep
[3:41:14] TachikomaKURO: Somewhat
[3:41:17] mroon20: It makes sense I think it would be weird to become friends with someone who's content you watched all the time
[3:41:24] farpadarp: It's very reasonable, just not something people are honest about a lot of the time
[3:41:25] TachikomaKURO: I can somewhat relate to what you're saying
[3:41:29] holomybaby: I think if I made the choice today that I had to befriend you, I would be coming to you (ostensibly a normal human) with so many expectations and preconceived notions that it would only suck ass
[3:41:33] JoeyG828: this does make sense still. I don’t hear other vtubers talk about this, that’s refreshing.
[3:41:54] holomybaby: and it’s weird! sometimes shit can just happen, but that’s just an odd goal to have, I think
[3:42:05] InsaneLoke: @holomybaby "unfortunately, ive made the choice to befriend you. im sorry but this is how it must be" LMAO

[3:42:49] InsaneLoke: okay. consumes you
[3:42:50] analog_demonic_kangaroo: but dont have to be their friend
[3:42:51] demon_dandy: It can be outward but it can also be a sans the self type of fan, like even appreciating the bad stuff of someone
[3:43:02] MorgiTime: @farpadarp yep. Just gotta be aware of the limits both ways
[3:43:05] pogotross: ok but now i'm hungry
[3:43:06] Navy_Mongoose: Ashton doing a good job covering up her cult tonight
[3:43:17] InsaneLoke: you did surprisingly well for being so locked into that talk
[3:43:20] AshtonMarten: farpadarp has won 5 from the jump catch game!

[3:43:31] JoeyG828: If chat were a snack, what would we be?
[3:43:32] JTBun: nah this is a good convo
[3:43:37] rikkaonline: imo viewer/streamer and friends are totally different things, i wouldnt want to go from one to the other without some external means
[3:43:45] buruhas: This is actually super interesting to learn about from the other side, you're a real one Ashton
[3:43:59] Senoquese: i am a horrible combination of both i am so parasocial but then i also still think of you as a super idol and i get anxiety shakes whenever i dm or ping you LMFAOO
[3:44:01] eatsaduckimust: ashton is my parasocial friend ashton51Wave
[3:44:08] rikkaonline: yeah
[3:44:18] InsaneLoke: not exactly on the same page but distantly related, i think theres a lot of fun going the opposite way and becoming fans of your friends
[3:44:25] JoeyG828: I think cheese. (this is a good convo, not trying to derail lol)
[3:44:36] demon_dandy: i hate parasocialism / omg me and the oomfies ashton51Blehhh "

[3:46:47] demon_dandy: NICE
[3:46:50] Navy_Mongoose: I want to be friends with Ashton because one time I had a dream where she came over like she was my babysitter and I was showingher my toy box and we ordered pizza
[3:47:00] Senoquese: you also always laugh at me whenever i say i look up to you ICANT
[3:47:11] farpadarp: snork
[3:47:15] ShiftedClock: @yojamjam even understanding these references, this sentence took some work to parse
[3:47:15] Envivii: i know some streamers keep an extremely deliberate separation between themselves and their fans, that's what works best for them
[3:47:18] ReyJaggy: yeah, just an 18+ lego set, mature and well put together
[3:47:27] farpadarp: She got them enlarged turbinates
[3:47:37] holomybaby: Snorks? like the underwater Smurfs?
