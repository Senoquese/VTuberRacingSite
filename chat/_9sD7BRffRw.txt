[1:38:19] mushi_buns: Lmaoooo
[1:38:21] rockstarplayzyt: the oldest car game I own is midnight club Los Angeles came out in 2008 and was made by Rockstar Games.
[1:38:21] Van_artic: lemme tell you something else: the sonic 1 logo in the intro screen is slightly off-centered to the left
[1:38:36] smoreeater: I'm not sure
[1:38:59] demon_dandy: the miles prower pun is forsure on purpose
[1:39:09] NoSongForSpiders: It’s on purpose! So the story goes, Japan Sega made the name, US Sega hated it and offered “Tails”, they compromised and used both
[1:39:15] TheAnglerCh: The character creator wanted to name him Miles Prower, but he Sega execs just wanted to call him Tails. They compromised by calling him tails in the games but his real name is Miles Prower
[1:39:21] Van_artic: yes JP calls him Miles in sonic 2
[1:39:30] rockstarplayzyt: and forza crashed again ascili1Ugh
[1:39:31] Van_artic: (and i guess sonic 3 as well)
[1:39:43] TheAnglerCh: Tails can go as fast as sonic in the original trilogy
[1:39:45] ReyJaggy: punny  name
[1:39:45] Van_artic: then it officially became Tails in Sonic Adventure

[1:40:05] ReyJaggy: This fact is messing with ashtons plays
[1:40:33] demon_dandy: hes blue! TPFufun
[1:40:36] TheAnglerCh: in Sonic 1 there were no different characters, in SOnic 2 tails couldn't fly, and in Sonic 3, Sonic could use elemental shields
[1:40:44] Van_artic: actually, sonic never had anything unique in the original games until the drop dash was created for sonic mania
[1:40:44] mushi_buns: Hes blue and coooool
[1:40:53] kirimichan: happy canada day
[1:40:54] PastaThief911: AYO POLE POSTITION
