[0:45:10] crisiscannibal: great name
[0:45:51] InsaneLoke: cheese
[0:46:05] YastenU: Kan is only if the guy who got the triplet draws a 4th
[0:46:13] american_cookie_1: I do not understand this game

[0:48:01] YastenU: In your hand
[0:48:04] demon_dandy: to the non jong players, most of the tiles are numbered but different suits (like cards) and shes trying to get either matchin numbers tiles (double 2 bamboo) or a sequence (3,4,5 dots) and have a bunch of those

[0:49:17] american_cookie_1: Why are they saying Ron?!?!
[0:49:23] crisiscannibal: The goal is to make a hand of 14 tiles first. There are 4 of each tile: 3 suits numbered 1-9, East, South, West, & North winds, & White, Green, & Red dragons. On your turn you draw 1 tile & discard 1. A basic hand has 4 sets & an identical pair. A set is 3 tiles that're either a sequence of same-suit numbers or a triplet of the same tile. Even if you have a finished hand, you must also have at least 1 yaku. Yaku are specific patterns of tiles or conditions to be met in order to win. Study them!

[1:33:44] crisiscannibal: @american_cookie_1 Ron is one of the ways of Agari (from "agariguse" meaning "to win a hand) in mahjong. When written in kanji, it is Sakae (meaning "prosperity"), and the official name is "Eiwa". Unlike "Tsumo", which is harmonized with the tiles drawn by oneself, when it is harmonized with the discarded tiles of the opponent, it becomes "Ron Wa-ryo". It takes precedence over Pon, Chii, Kan.

[1:40:01] crisiscannibal: @imjucario boiled down to its core concept, mahjong is a pattern matching game where you try to complete at minimum one designated combination of tiles among 14 tiles which are then scored for points.

[2:48:00] PartyBus_TV: you probably really like dithering ashton; its how they do shading in pixelart for crts
[2:48:05] crisiscannibal: The goal is to make a hand of 14 tiles first. There are 4 of each tile: 3 suits numbered 1-9, East, South, West, & North winds, & White, Green, & Red dragons. On your turn you draw 1 tile & discard 1. A basic hand has 4 sets & an identical pair. A set is 3 tiles that're either a sequence of same-suit numbers or a triplet of the same tile. Even if you have a finished hand, you must also have at least 1 yaku. Yaku are specific patterns of tiles or conditions to be met in order to win. Study them!
