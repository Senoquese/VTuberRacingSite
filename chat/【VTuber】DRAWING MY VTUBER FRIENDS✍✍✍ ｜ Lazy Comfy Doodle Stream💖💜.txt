[0:38:46] ChessCatUWU: Could I ask what music is playing? It's a bop.
[0:39:10] AshtonMarten: „Éï„É´„ÉÅ„Ç´„Çæ„É≥ (feat. Megurine Luka)
[0:39:14] ChessCatUWU: Thank you!!!
[0:40:32] Darumainu: I follow her on skeb but i wasn't sure if asking for a model is possible lol kus i wasnt sure if she cut it to be rigged or that was done by someone esle
[0:40:50] Sonicb00m111: Wew lad this is a pump up jam
[0:40:52] Darumainu: I loved her artstyle for a long while
[0:41:08] ReyJaggy: She has the knack for it, be vtuber mama
[0:41:59] Playmer: what if she becomes a prolific mama and you have so many siblings üëÄ
[0:42:04] Darumainu: I wanna take my hand and try to make my own model but I also feel overwhelmed by the process of it lmao. so I just have one maid thru vroid for now  lynmamOmegalul
[0:42:08] Ramathal: never hurts to try
[0:42:09] ReyJaggy: All chinchillas
[0:42:12] Darumainu: made*
[0:43:06] Darumainu: i agree, which is why id like to get it directly thru her I just wasnt sure if she still did. I guess id have to ask :3
[0:43:52] VERTIGRIS: Making vtuber models really is a ton of work zambiiSnooze
[0:44:27] Darumainu: understandable! I was just curious lynmamComfy
[0:44:37] souly_ch: the worst they can say is no
[0:44:40] souly_ch: prodbo2Tehepero
[0:45:21] ReyJaggy: Vtuber creators are like the surgeons of art
[0:45:29] demon_dandy: oh yeahhhh
[0:45:42] demon_dandy: i really liked the start and fell off q little
[0:45:43] ReyJaggy: Oh i read the first couple of chapters
[0:46:14] demon_dandy: i kinda wanna get back into shy
[0:47:34] demon_dandy: oh thats nice of em
[0:47:55] ReyJaggy: i can see what you liked from Shy's mangaka art style
[0:48:00] demon_dandy: too much coolio manga
[0:48:00] ReyJaggy: the big sparkly eyes
[0:48:25] demon_dandy: i really liked that tall "scary" classmate in shy
[0:49:29] souly_ch: very important disclaimer üôè
[0:49:33] niertlwal: that's more of a touch grass situation
[0:49:40] niertlwal: people gotta learn to touch grass
[0:49:41] Darumainu: tbh if anything I have notifs on when they open skebs...it always closes really fast tho haha
[0:49:45] ReyJaggy: If shy's mangaka had accepted would you still have gone for chinchilla race queen?
[0:49:56] niertlwal: NotLikeThis
[0:50:10] ReyJaggy: fair fair!
[0:50:42] niertlwal: I think artists want to get paid tbf
[0:51:12] demon_dandy: in all realities, you are chinchila
[0:51:26] niertlwal: riggers i can see because they need portfolios
[0:51:30] Darumainu: i think the fun with vtubing with having various artists for assets/models is like a mini collection of art you love from artists you love
[0:51:43] niertlwal: a much more competitive area
[0:51:53] Darumainu: while i like the idea of having control from drawing my own model, i also like the idea of having a model from an artist i love as well
[0:52:08] ranranrun: competitive chinchilla games
[0:52:13] demon_dandy: i wanna be vtuber, itd be cool to have an audience
[0:52:18] niertlwal: I guess, but that's more competitive at large with art
[0:52:30] niertlwal: rather than just the vtuber space
[0:52:50] demon_dandy: a rat race indeed TPFufun
[0:53:12] ReyJaggy: falshtubers
