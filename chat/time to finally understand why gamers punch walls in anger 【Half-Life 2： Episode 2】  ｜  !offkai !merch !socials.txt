[1:05:29] GManx0: Huh
[1:05:30] Bookethead: his wife tried to kill him actually
[1:05:37] Senoquese: all i know is that he shook hands with a tree

[1:06:42] DatBoiVLC: He was a role model I think that was the big deal
[1:07:02] JTBun: he was a role model when I golfed
[1:07:10] demon_dandy: Ngl in hindsight, the papers and shit were so rabid
[1:07:11] DatBoiVLC: He still golfing BTW
[1:07:38] Senoquese: who did you kill
[1:07:44] GManx0: Ashton is Over Party on Twitter
[1:07:54] DatBoiVLC: What about that lady and the soccer star?
[1:07:57] JTBun: oh yeah
[1:07:58] DatBoiVLC: That was nuts
[1:07:59] JTBun: ofc
[1:08:02] rikkaonline: ashton prepping us to hear about her own allegations
[1:08:11] ZippiBelfast: I can't believe the race lady is mean in private
[1:08:22] JTBun: I mean I learned that when I got older
[1:08:28] GManx0: It isn‚Äôt surprising. Doesn‚Äôt make it right
[1:08:33] f1sh_bo1: "never meet your heroes" A very true statment
[1:08:38] horribleham: ashton getting ahead of the allegations
[1:08:40] Senoquese: whenever i type mean stuff ashton takes me behind the paddock and yells at me until i cry
[1:08:54] taz168821: What?
[1:09:00] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Cry
[1:09:05] leftenantsalt: bad take for sure
[1:09:10] T33bags: i think it depends who youre being mean to and the nature of you being mean
[1:09:21] The_Isaac_Newton: No, you got a point
[1:09:22] demon_dandy: Nah i get what shes saying
[1:09:35] rikkaonline: i dont think the people outed as being an asshole had a moment of weakness - its almost always a pattern of behavior because theyre just assholes
[1:09:37] DatBoiVLC: People are allowed to make poor choices, it's their actions after that that matter
[1:10:01] T33bags: like if jerma got mad at waitress in such a karen way that would signal to me that he probably treats waitresses like that
[1:10:10] DatBoiVLC: The real question is whether or not it's anybody else's business...
[1:10:18] ZippiBelfast: I think you're right. People are human and human's aren't perfect.
[1:10:27] leftenantsalt: if u want to be mean, find someone who's willing to listen to take it out on
[1:10:32] demon_dandy: Shes becoming northernlion right now ashton51Tensai
[1:10:36] GManx0: Again, Maybe not surprising but also not right
[1:10:51] T33bags: ive met so many people as a waiter having a bad day only the real assholes got mad at me and made it my problem
[1:10:51] leftenantsalt: u shouldn't be mean to people who want nothing to do with your bs
[1:11:00] rikkaonline: i dont think the people that have to suffer their meanness would agree assholes can be assholes

[1:11:49] The_Isaac_Newton: Yeah no one has the right to be mean, but it happens, you face the consequences, but it doesn't mean you're always like that
[1:12:01] taz168821: It‚Äôs ok Ashtonü´≥ü´≥ü´≥ü´≥
[1:12:14] rikkaonline: do you mean actually be mean to someone, or just talk shit about them?
[1:12:18] ZippiBelfast: People tend to think in absolutes lately. So if you've done one less than good thing people will just assume that you're the scum of the earth.
[1:12:19] T33bags: thats what i mean it depends on who youre being mean to and the nature of how youre being mean
[1:12:54] DatBoiVLC: You're talking about speaking negatively of other people when it's truthful type shit
[1:12:57] T33bags: getting mad at a stranger like a waitress is making your anger their problem now and its demeaning
[1:13:16] rikkaonline: i dont think "being mean" is a good way to phrase what you mean
[1:13:18] Senoquese: people cant be perfect 24/7 and they shouldnt be completely cancelled for it but theres still gotta be consequences if stuff does end up happening
[1:13:22] ReyJaggy: if you do that with your friends, they would probably think you say things about them to others
[1:13:32] demon_dandy: I feel like were inserting ourselves into wild hypothesies LMAO
[1:13:49] DatBoiVLC: Goddamn I guess I have to stop being a bitch ashton51Cry
[1:14:11] Kitkattack: airing their dirty laundry, is a really fitting phrase for people that just want to dump mild drama

[1:14:20] Senoquese: what you mean is that sometimes people get way bigger consequences compared to what they did?
[1:14:44] T33bags: yeah in a personal relationship youre right but it was a broad stroke to brush with your original statement no issue with what you actually think
[1:14:46] demon_dandy: it depends on the level of fakeness and the recipient ig but its all situational
[1:14:53] ReyJaggy: i think thats a more internet drama thing
[1:14:53] DatBoiVLC: Yeah like uhhh nvm he was a president
[1:15:02] fixedspectacles2014: I hope shaking chillas isn't mean soulycOmetsus

[1:15:12] katsuragi_kakeruvt: wait whats going on? :3
[1:15:29] rikkaonline: yeah this sounds a lot different that what your initial assertion sounded like
[1:15:35] Senoquese: i get what you mean and i agree now that you rephrased it LOOL
[1:15:38] JTBun: @katsuragi_kakeruvt don't worry about it :)
[1:15:40] Senoquese: you just gave a really weird example

[1:16:07] JTBun: BE MEAN
[1:16:24] T33bags: youre not wrong definitely you just brushed a broad stroke and i didnt say thats what you meant LMAOOO i was giving an example of where being mean isnt ok and is very demeaning
[1:16:32] JTBun: yes
[1:17:07] Kitkattack: yeah social media... helluva drug
[1:17:14] horribleham: idk, there is something to be said about two-faced. But idk about getting canceled
[1:17:21] rikkaonline: i dont entirely agree because i think people should avoid talking shit in the first place, but yeah trying to get them ostracized for doing it is probably a little more shitty imo
[1:17:30] Senoquese: if its one or two examples thats *okay*. its kinda just a diary. if its a LOT then thats shitty and can be a deeper issue
[1:17:39] JTBun: true
[1:17:49] ZippiBelfast: Well it depends on how deep it goes
[1:18:00] DatBoiVLC: God so many people could benefit from actively keeping a journal
[1:18:23] JTBun: LMAO
[1:18:24] rikkaonline: putting in a journal and burning sounds good, but putting it in a private twitter isnt that - you have readers there, so youre doing the same shit talking that the person publicizing it is doing
[1:18:26] T33bags: youre  not wrong definitely you just brushed a broad stroke and i didnt say thats what you meant LMAOOO i was giving an example of where being mean isnt ok and is very demeaning
[1:18:30] laser3365: like writing a letter in a bottle?
[1:18:35] Senoquese: @rikkaonline ^^^^
[1:18:37] Senoquese: was going to say this
[1:19:01] DatBoiVLC: That's like live journal or xanga
[1:19:08] rikkaonline: "im upset" and "fuck this person" are different
[1:19:11] Senoquese: venting about general events is different
[1:19:32] Senoquese: if you have a problem with a person the one thing to do is bring it up with them
[1:19:39] Senoquese: even if its incredibly very very tiny and meaningless
[1:19:45] ReyJaggy: i think most have grown with "if you have nothing good to say, dont say anything at all" so having a space to vent would go against that
[1:19:54] demon_dandy: I think it stops bein in private frustration when it becomes a back and forth ig ashton51Tehe
[1:20:24] Senoquese: ashton51Sip

[5:39:42] JTBun: @T33bags lmao yes, red gone
[5:39:45] Senoquese: you gotta think about how this was written when they still wanted to release a bunch of new episodes, not during the time everyone wanted HL3
[5:39:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: like he wants it amazingly written
[5:39:48] cashBandicoochie: Gman is so pretentious. Without him HL1 would be self contained
