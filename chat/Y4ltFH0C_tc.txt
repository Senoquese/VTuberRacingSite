[1:21:28] DatBoiVLC: I think it's the love quadrangle in seven is amazing
[1:21:29] spikebomb5: theyre still popular but not the cultural juggernaut anymore
[1:21:39] metaconstruct: yo ashton51Sip
[1:21:39] HmmHrmHarumph: 15 is ASS
[1:21:52] rodetovenaar: I loved 15...
[1:21:57] hototari: 11 is lowkey the best FF game ever made
[1:22:00] WhiteAdam: 15 was just a road trip with the boys
[1:22:08] demon_dandy: ff16 is awesome to play ashton51Heyyy
[1:22:09] insp_gadget: i guess it depends on how much tech you find acceptable in the final fantasy series., because one game has an airship being legendary tech. and then you have ff7 which might as well been set in the 1900's
[1:22:13] virtualoop: ff6 and 14 are the only ff games ive played ICANT
[1:22:13] Private_Shorty: 16 gameplay looked good at least
[1:22:16] DatBoiVLC: there's like a 15 is unfortunate because they took the story and put it in so many places that nobody cared to figure out what was even happening. you had to watch an anime and a movie and buy DLC and play a mobile game
[1:22:26] spikebomb5: i like both 15+16. they are flawed gems
[1:22:45] Navy_Mongoose: Haye Clivr and Noctis (I play tekken)
[1:22:58] spikebomb5: muh pokemon

[1:23:08] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:23:14] DatBoiVLC: @spikebomb5 15 had a really good story and again really good character writing and unfortunately we didn't even get most of the story DLC because of how poorly they handled it
[1:23:15] virtualoop: hot take, chuuni stuff is cool
[1:23:20] spikebomb5: handsome guy but hes also a titan
[1:23:26] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552

[1:25:39] Burr11: new game ashton51Love
[1:25:44] JTBun: you should playyyyy Mother 3 :)
[1:25:46] spikebomb5: my main critique is that very few western devs actually delve into history/mythology for aesthetics
[1:25:53] JTBun: its on your game list :)
[1:25:55] Senoquese: all i know about tales of is that the devs are trying to remaster the games but they lost the source code to everything and are contacting a bunch of devs to try and find it ashton51ICANT
[1:26:01] RedOniVA: El Shaddai?
[1:26:01] ahzree: Mother series is also so good
[1:26:13] RedOniVA: El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron
[1:26:22] insp_gadget: japanese twist on the west, like a japanese cowboy, or ppl looking like they're straight out of the 70's like happy days or grease.
[1:26:23] Senoquese: youd love mother i think
[1:26:27] Kitkattack: oh god that game is so beloved somehow

[1:26:41] JTBun: Mother 3 is on your game list, I added it :)
[1:26:45] phatscout: ash why are you watching matpat?
[1:26:46] JTBun: play it :)
[1:27:02] JTBun: yesh quite some time ago
[1:27:23] Senoquese: the fact there are still spoiler warnings for mothers story to this day shows how beloved it is

[1:27:56] virtualoop: i wanna see you play Xenosaga 1-3, its legit one of my favorite JRPGs
[1:28:00] to_aru_Oni: It's a great game.
[1:28:01] Kitkattack: to bad even the shortest FF game are like 30+ hours
[1:28:07] JTBun: Mother 1 and 2 (earthbound), somewhat connected, but they are all pretty much separate games with different stories
[1:28:11] HmmHrmHarumph: ennock
[1:28:13] insp_gadget: it would be interesting if they actually spent some time to translate games that never had a english release after 25-40 years. but they never do.
[1:28:32] Qrockpot: CHUUNI WORDS
[1:28:33] pogotross: cowards never include Jesus
[1:28:41] Senoquese: you should play garf kart 2 its somehow worse
[1:28:50] JTBun: yes
[1:28:59] Blaisevtch: @virtualoop my chilla Xenoblade players dont know about how good it is
[1:29:09] lunarepiphany: ashton, nobody can see where my PCRW tag on discord comes from is that a setting we can change? DIESOFCHILLA DIESOFCHILLA
[1:29:10] Kitkattack: Kos-mos so prettty
[1:29:18] virtualoop: just the same series, Xenogears and Xenosaga are related slightly, Xenoblade is basically completely seperate
[1:29:43] Senoquese: LOL
[1:29:50] JTBun: @Senoquese yeah they dont have the puzzle pieces
[1:29:53] virtualoop: Xenosaga is also suuuuuuper into the whole "jrpg religion thing", like it uses Christianity so much LMAO the game even has the Pope in it
[1:30:11] lunarepiphany: dang! i dont want randos in the server but i wish we could see the promo tag
[1:30:25] Qrockpot: discoverable servers blechhhh
[1:30:36] JTBun: yeahhhh i feel like making it public would cause some issues lmao
[1:30:40] Senoquese: i thought everyone sees the tag they just cant preview the server through it
[1:30:44] pseudochrome: you can maybe quarantine off the main channels and moderate who gets them
[1:30:53] demon_dandy: They kno who the P crew are ashton51Heyyy
[1:30:54] Qrockpot: LOL
[1:31:03] shaddydeevy98: I feel like the peanut thing you said is most likely gonna be in an out of context ashton clip LUL

[1:32:20] JTBun: OH YEAH LMAO
[1:32:21] deafmutelaughing: Persona 2
[1:32:21] Senoquese: so idk what you mean unless our server is also different from that
[1:32:27] HmmHrmHarumph: why would it be removed?
[1:32:29] lunarepiphany: @Senoquese i was told by a friend they couldnt see, it said "private server", so it must be a setting somewhere
[1:32:30] demon_dandy: No they put hitler in both p1 and p2
[1:32:34] MelvinSoupreme: woah
[1:32:34] astorquil: astorquil subscribed with Prime. 
[1:32:34] Qrockpot: whats wrong with referencing a historical figure
[1:32:34] Malictory: No no, it was P2 that has the bushy mustached man:3
[1:32:37] JTBun: im sorry that you played p1 and p2
[1:32:41] WhiteAdam: I learned about you from that concert you did
[1:32:41] zer0hazard: bionic commando has censored hitler as the final boss
[1:32:43] spikebomb5: depicting hitler is only bad if ur glorifying him or something
[1:32:43] Senoquese: @lunarepiphany weirdd that must be a separate setting from discoverability then
[1:33:07] Kitkattack: those games were rough
[1:33:10] Malictory: Eventually, they gave him shades and a jacket and called him "Fuhrer" instead to kinda mask him:3
[1:33:11] deafmutelaughing: in the PSP version they gave him sunglasses
[1:33:26] demon_dandy: Oh thats what it was LOL

[1:34:16] rodetovenaar: I mean, so was P5
[1:34:19] Kitkattack: yeah kenji's whole story is about being closeted and it isn't handled well at all
[1:34:32] PSYCOMMUnist: it really isn't, it's about him confronting his insecurity which is the point of the jungian shadow
[1:34:37] pseudochrome: persona 4 is a double legend that queer baited us with back to back dungeons
[1:34:46] deafmutelaughing: p5 had the gay couple harassing ryuji which they kiiiinda fixed in royal
[1:34:48] virtualoop: bro i remember playing Persona 4 for so long, and I was romancing Rise, I got to the scene where they all get drunk together and i was like "damn Rise is annoying as fuck when shes drunk" and i just never finished the game after LMAO

[1:35:18] bonatide: I watched a giga fujo play p4 and it was so funny watching the suffering
[1:35:29] PSYCOMMUnist: the point is him getting over the no homo attitude...
[1:35:42] Qrockpot: hiimdaisy erasure is real, i havent heard that name in so long
[1:35:47] Blaisevtch: @PSYCOMMUnist this is what I got too
[1:35:48] FesalyMojito: BUT I LIKE WOMEN
[1:36:01] DatBoiVLC: Atlas is famously terrible at handling marginalized identities
[1:36:09] pseudochrome: if theyre not cowards theyll add the datamined yosuke romance lines back into the remake
[1:36:17] PSYCOMMUnist: yeah but yosuke isn't the one confronting his shadow
[1:36:25] PSYCOMMUnist: having a teenager be homophobic is pretty realistic
[1:36:31] virtualoop: i think i just have that issue with Persona games bc I played Persona 5, got to where you see the teacher in a Bikini, and i was like "thats all i need" and i never played the game again after that LMAO
[1:36:49] demon_dandy: Teddy kinda ups it though
[1:37:08] BaneHallowed: whoa whoa he does face himself at the end of the fight

[1:38:27] virtualoop: me when i say the game where you shoot yourself in the head to fight demons is a kid game
[1:38:28] spikebomb5: wlw is considered relatively harmless, a phase even, but mlm is seen as transgressionary
[1:38:30] BaneHallowed: for 16 year old kids
[1:38:31] DavidPortnov: Definitely not a kids game.
[1:38:36] Kitkattack: definitely not E rated games
[1:38:36] FesalyMojito: what do you mean? The love hotel was totally family friendly
[1:38:37] Qrockpot: inb4 next persona is abour middle schoolers
[1:38:46] deafmutelaughing: sitting my 6-year-old down with persona 4 and not letting him leave the room until he makes it through the first month
[1:38:53] Senoquese: making a kid play persona 5 is like if you wanna groom them bro
[1:39:05] JTBun: @Senoquese LMAOOOOOOOOO
[1:39:15] PSYCOMMUnist: I think confronting insecurity about homosexuality is pretty progressive for its time
[1:39:18] demon_dandy: Also gay people arent like that salacious ICANT

[1:41:12] ArthurWar: Oh yeah, they did do that
[1:41:15] Qrockpot: nintendogs was dystopian
[1:41:19] JTBun: you think they had did stuff backstage?
[1:41:27] BaneHallowed: the remake of 4 is going to be so badly translated

[1:41:32] DavidPortnov: I was also playing Urbz: Sims in the City on DS.
[1:41:38] PSYCOMMUnist: I think being willing to be one of the first to tackle it is braver than doing it when there's a decade of precedent building up into a better execution

[5:50:19] pogotross: ashton's gonna be that guy and she's gonna tell everyone they're gay
[5:50:22] Private_Shorty: @demon_dandy +2
[5:50:28] DavidPortnov: Yeah, they riff off the audience live. Whether some of them were plants or not, I don't really know, but I doubt it.
[5:50:44] DavidPortnov: At least during a non-taped live show.
[5:51:11] pogotross: om maybe just start with a discord call with friends
[5:51:16] Private_Shorty: My roommate goes to an improv club the 1st thur of every month with another friend of mine
[5:51:33] Private_Shorty: I'd rather just stream to nobody and talk to myself like NL did for 10 years to get funny
[5:51:53] pogotross: no one likes SNL what do you mean
[5:52:00] Blaisevtch: thank you i hate snl
[5:52:18] DavidPortnov: I've only watched a handful of SNL shorts, but I really want to like it from a historical perspective.
[5:52:23] bonatide: snl peaked with norm and has been downhill since
[5:52:32] Private_Shorty: Yeah he's one of the more "normie" streamers, against all odds
[5:52:34] demon_dandy: Wrong, it WAS the ten years of binding of isaac
[5:52:34] c_v_catullus16: What's with the brainrot layout tonight? Are sandbox games not stimulating enough for chat?
[5:52:38] pogotross: RIP Norm I miss you
[5:52:55] DavidPortnov: Chris Farley?
[5:52:57] pogotross: norm at the end there
[5:53:01] KyuuMJ: Which fat guy?
[5:53:01] Blaisevtch: Chris farley?
[5:53:01] Private_Shorty: Yeah but like one of the new white guys is from dropout so that's cool
[5:53:02] niertlwal: would you say you could make it as a comedian if streaming didn't work out
[5:53:12] RycegoZ: SNL's weekend update is great, also the changing cast is good since you can see actors/comedians before they break out
[5:53:15] bonatide: chris farley?
[5:53:18] DavidPortnov: Norm Macdonald
[5:53:26] TheAsterite: snl really started going downhill after the andy samberg generation
[5:53:27] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[5:53:30] DavidPortnov: Hard to say, maybe not.
[5:53:30] KyuuMJ: @niertlwal Comedian is a very competitive job
[5:53:30] Blaisevtch: i would watch every show
[5:53:32] Private_Shorty: Do you have a chat to riff off of?
[5:53:36] pogotross: :) Being a comedian is 90% driving
[5:53:46] c_v_catullus16: Do you have the budget for this park hidden?
[5:53:52] TheAsterite: ashton51Omegalul
[5:53:53] niertlwal: time to get her in the UCB comedy classes
[5:53:54] Pudddd: maybe if they let you play videogames on stage
[5:53:55] niertlwal: lmfao
[5:53:56] RycegoZ: Norm MacDonald gt fired cause of all the OJ jokes
[5:53:58] Ragatags: Stand up? dont most streams sit down ashton51Hehe
[5:54:01] bonatide: norm is the peak of comedy i try to emulate everyday
[5:54:22] niertlwal: comedy intifada
[5:54:30] DavidPortnov: Yeah, he was big fan of oranges and people judged him for it.
[5:54:37] RycegoZ: You probably were alive back then unc, you should remember it
[5:54:38] pogotross: he went on a comedy central roast and did the worst dad jokes ever and it was amazing
[5:54:38] Private_Shorty: Did the monorail (2) break btw?
[5:54:42] c_v_catullus16: What's underground?
[5:54:46] demon_dandy: Watchin ashton stand up "nooo ashton baby talk cant be in the routine ashton51Despair
[5:55:03] DavidPortnov: @demon_dandy This exactly.
[5:55:07] pogotross: he hid it for a long time
[5:55:24] metaconstruct: hindsight

[5:55:51] c_v_catullus16: !lurk
[5:55:52] DavidPortnov: Yeah, I felt really bad for him.
[5:55:53] Blaisevtch: that one was sad…
[5:55:56] pogotross: om norm yeah he joked about it
[5:56:03] Ragatags: om
[5:56:06] DavidPortnov: I'm not really familiar with Chris Farley either.
[5:56:16] RycegoZ: I still think Trevor Moore is funnier than Norm since he felt like a more satiric George Carlin
[5:56:18] TheAsterite: chris farley's last appearances were hard to watch
[5:56:21] Private_Shorty: I think it's broken Ashton...
[5:56:30] TheAsterite: ashton51Despair
[5:56:33] bonatide: Norm had constant bits about dying and not knowing he was sick and then he died in the same way
[5:56:40] Blaisevtch: lmaooo
[5:56:48] bonatide: Legitimately i think he was a genius
[5:56:57] RycegoZ: @TheAsterite Love how Jack Black played a character like him in Tropic Thunder

[5:59:34] CrystalWings53: now he has to get the call on his phone before he realizes he needs to fix it
