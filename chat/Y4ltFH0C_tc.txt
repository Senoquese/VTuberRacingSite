[2:09:39] demon_dandy: She knows all the theory but no practice ashton51Despair
[2:10:05] geistbox: dk spaceport is one of the levels that's improved by connectors imo
[2:10:16] ArthurWar: The gimmick and theme is really neat, the music progressing with each lap is also fun, but that's all it has going for it
[2:10:22] demon_dandy: Hit the rainbow road for this game
[2:10:24] HashiriyaR32: ashton51Despair
[2:10:33] geistbox: its cause the level is just one straight shot instead of 3 laps

[2:24:03] demon_dandy: @senoquese i guess its just got the most material to work with ashton51Tehe
[2:24:06] deafmutelaughing: @Senoquese extremely cynical reason: so they can use the space setting to introduce a nintendo cinematic universe
[2:24:08] bonatide: idk 14 seems to fit you
[2:24:12] buruhas: mario karted ashton51Pathetic ashton51Pathetic ashton51Pathetic ashton51Pathetic
[2:24:17] ArthurWar: I'm assuming there'll be a Mario Movie direct like there was last time, that'll be where they confirm Rosalina's voice

[2:24:25] SeiyunNanashi: Yeah my luck has ran out and now I am dying aeroWHEEZE
[2:24:30] DatBoiVLC: this game seems so much less forgiving than 8dx
[2:24:35] DatBoiVLC: really need to grind to get any good I guess
[2:24:40] deafmutelaughing: like imagine at the end of the film it shows some star flying the other direction and it's kirby
[2:24:47] Aefen: LMAO
[2:24:50] remilia35: Its the dress I like for this rosalina
[2:24:54] Senoquese: i wish they did a mario land or mario world movie instead ashton51Tehe just gradually move through the franchise
[2:24:57] BlazeKong64: I'm still waiting on some stuff from Donkey Kong Bananza for this game lol
[2:25:08] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Mommy Rosalina
[2:25:15] remilia35: The bombs!
[2:25:19] deafmutelaughing: a mario land movie with a fully villainous wario would rule
[2:25:22] remilia35: LUL
[2:25:27] PSYCOMMUnist: +2
[2:25:29] Senoquese: casting actual children as the actors gave me some hope itll be good
[2:25:31] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: REALLY!
[2:25:36] Blaisevtch: thank you for this based comment I think BotW did ruin zelda
[2:25:37] RycegoZ: Aren't they using an actor from Euphoria?
[2:25:54] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Not a breath of wild fan?
[2:26:03] BlazeKong64: I wish for traditional Zelda to return
[2:26:11] ArthurWar: I'm just tired of being in BotW Hyrule, we've had four games there if you count Warriors
[2:26:20] Senoquese: i agree, like how the botw logo really fit that specific game and then became the franchise logo for every future game
[2:26:21] Kitkattack: that's a monster lobby
[2:26:28] Aefen: yeah the BoTW style is cool but I want a traditional game again
[2:26:46] demon_dandy: ashton51Nodders ashton51Nodders
[2:27:03] Aefen: if they were smart they'd make it OoT themed
[2:27:07] Senoquese: zelda being a kid actress makes me hope itll be oot ashton51Tehe
[2:27:15] rikkaonline: idk its basically confirmed that we're getting an oot remake next year, so i could see it being that instead
[2:27:19] deafmutelaughing: what if they base it off the 1980s cartoon instead
[2:27:21] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Yeah they need to put young butts in the seats
[2:27:32] geistbox: I think they'll go for a composite movie with zelda, since they're going with very young actors who don't feel like they'd fit into a BOTW type story
[2:28:01] Kitkattack: I thought you loved Disney
[2:28:02] 十干: they just want to find a way to make sure their wallets will be full after the project is done
[2:28:13] rikkaonline: thats wildly cynical
[2:28:13] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Yeah it's just a fueling of the machine, if anything earlier zelda games might get a mention
[2:28:14] Senoquese: @Kitkattack disneyland
[2:28:14] Aefen: LMAO
[2:28:20] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH

[2:28:40] Kitkattack: and sea, and world, and the other one in japan
[2:28:49] 十干: that's OK I also am not a huge disneyland fan

[2:28:58] MelvinSoupreme: i like listening even if i cant understand
[2:29:00] Senoquese: no no she loves disneyland not disney
[2:29:07] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Oh original Disney gotcha based,  that stunned me cause thought you all in on new Disney
[2:29:14] yojamjam: nintendo put the dungeons in the bag challenge impossible
[2:29:27] RycegoZ: Last place, LMAO
[2:29:40] rikkaonline: tbh that sounds like a bad case of "everything that came before i found the franchise is good, and everything after is bad"
[2:29:41] Aefen: LMAOOO
[2:29:41] 十干: i feel like it's alright to be critical sometimes when it's necessary
[2:29:44] Kitkattack: being critical of things you really enjoy ashton51Thinky I don't really get it but ok
[2:29:52] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Your park standards higher
[2:30:01] Aefen: I don't know why they think the live action remakes are a good thing
[2:30:03] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: I get it
[2:30:11] Senoquese: @Kitkattack you are always critical of ashtons yaps ashton51Omega
[2:30:14] RycegoZ: No one's more of a hater than an ex-fan

[2:31:36] demon_dandy: yeah yeah defunctland video to your fastpass
[2:31:37] BlazeKong64: I refuse to acknowledge Disney Star Wars

[2:31:39] MelvinSoupreme: ashton51Nodders ashton51Nodders ashton51Nodders
[2:31:56] BlazeKong64: George Lucas gave Disney the template for how Star Wars worked and Disney threw it out
[2:32:01] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @kitkattack  to me 4,5, and 6 are starwars the rest are fan fic.....acolyte came out and i don't even go see the movies anymore
[2:32:02] Kitkattack: let's go gambling ashton51Spin

[2:32:41] Kitkattack: @OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__ yes love og's, prequel is alright and I quite like some tertiary books and games
[2:32:53] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: I didn't know your hated breath of the wild, i didn't okay but it looked like a good game.... why do you hate it?
[2:33:04] Aefen: bro if I was toad and Peach looked at me and said "ew" I'd go jump in a volcano
[2:33:06] RycegoZ: BASED, Furries deserve to suffer
[2:33:16] HashiriyaR32: Yeah, screw Disney Star Wars.  They basically alienated the fans who were there from the very beginning for "fans" who had no intention of financially supporting the franchise in the first place.
[2:33:18] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Lol
[2:33:24] yojamjam: he's not in the game because of an ongoing lawsuit from falco lombardi
[2:33:35] Senoquese: @OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__ botw is an alright game but it shouldnt be the main stay of the franchise is what she means
[2:33:42] bonatide: blue balling furries is a weird strat
[2:33:53] rikkaonline: i will forever love botw as a return to the form of the first zelda
[2:33:57] Senoquese: LOL
[2:33:58] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Gotcha
[2:34:04] rikkaonline: i think its pretty clear the next zelda will be something new again
[2:34:06] richiexiii: Disney is the ultimate fumbler? I'd say that title belongs to MGM. They own multiple films, yet they barely do any promotions nor financial support especially making business decisions.
[2:34:12] demon_dandy: I mean didnt even really, those goat people in totk went crazy
[2:34:12] Red__2: ashton51Sus
[2:34:14] richiexiii: Also, hi Ashton. Hi Pitcrew. o/
[2:34:17] chewyrock_en: I really dont get the durability debacle for that game. Just dont be a hoarder
[2:34:21] SeiyunNanashi: Coms are mandatory cause we need 24 players
[2:34:47] rikkaonline: we're getting an oot remake, it was in one of those big leaks
[2:34:54] ArthurWar: They try to have something Zelda-related each year it feels like, the next Warriors is this year's
[2:34:54] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @richiexiii hiya
[2:35:10] rikkaonline: no, i wont try to make myself hate something i enjoyed
[2:35:11] RycegoZ: 4 hours dissection? Someone has too much free time
[2:35:20] pogotross: om lotr movie length dissection
[2:35:29] rikkaonline: you can nitpick anything to death if you try enough
[2:35:31] mareeples: That ToTK take down was great, yeah.
[2:35:33] chewyrock_en: I would use AI summarize for long ass video essays like those
[2:35:42] richiexiii: Oh yeah.
[2:35:55] MelvinSoupreme: lmao
[2:36:01] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Go off
[2:36:04] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[2:36:10] Aefen: she extra locks in when she rants
[2:36:13] 十干: oh yeah 100% that's why a big percentage of video games were only in japan
[2:36:21] richiexiii: That is fair.
[2:36:21] Senoquese: watching nichijou and saying its not funny because theres too many japanese references
[2:36:23] demon_dandy: Botw or Totk?
[2:36:33] Kitkattack: yeah I feel like it's an insane take to just say every aspect about something you like is perfect
[2:36:34] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Is it the story?
[2:36:34] pogotross: om this brings me back to LttP vs OoT

[2:37:13] pogotross: om
[2:37:14] Plasma_Strife: It's fine if you didn't connect with a popular game. For example, I couldn't click with The Last of Us (no pun intended)
[2:37:16] demon_dandy: Well i mean that specifically cause if you enjoyed botw and enjoy it less with totk that feels different
[2:37:25] Aefen: she's overflowing with whimsy
[2:37:26] richiexiii: Yeah, same here.
[2:37:31] deafmutelaughing: I love criticizing my favorite things
[2:37:36] pogotross: om "I'm a hater because of too much joy"
[2:37:48] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: That's a good thing,   we can love things and see their flaws
[2:38:00] chewyrock_en: only thing I didnt like about TotK were the companions that follow you. Makes it very cramped compared to how intimate BotW was
[2:38:04] demon_dandy: LOL
[2:38:06] deafmutelaughing: I can spend hours talking about bad ace attorney plotpoints but it's my favorite series
[2:38:06] Senoquese: botw was really good because it was the only one of its kind, its not special if everything is botw
[2:38:10] Red__2: ICANT
[2:38:11] richiexiii: @pogotross I remember seeing a CollegeHumor (now known as "Drop Out") doing a skit about it on pro wrestling fans. "I like pro wrestling, that's why I hate it." LOL
[2:38:12] Aefen: LMAO
[2:38:15] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: That's good analysis

[3:16:54] Aefen: really? I like BoTW's plot but not ToTK
[3:16:59] yojamjam: zeldas seldom have compelling narratives
[3:17:06] yojamjam: i think twipri is an outlier
[3:17:15] RycegoZ: BOTW was good and worked with the Dynasty Warriors prequel that was noncanon. But it's been 8 years, we need a new Zelda
[3:17:16] BlazeKong64: If Breath of the Wild did not exist, I would have appreciated Tears of the Kingdom more
[3:17:39] Aefen: I don't know WHY they decided to do all that in totk
[3:17:57] ArthurWar: Especially since they added full voice-acting in those ones, they did want the story to be more important
[3:18:10] Senoquese: botw was special because it was the only one of its kind
[3:18:13] rikkaonline: having started at the beginning of the series, zeldas rarely have an meaningful plot within the game itself in my mind
[3:18:19] Aefen: I love Twilight Princess
[3:18:24] MojomoVT: ToTK was BotW's Majora's mask but I think it needed something other than a gameplay rehash
