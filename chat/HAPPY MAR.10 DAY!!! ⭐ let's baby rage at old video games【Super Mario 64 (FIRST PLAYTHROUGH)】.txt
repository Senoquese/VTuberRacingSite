[0:35:36] 1redpowern: pepole were mad cause they stoped selling them, they only sold it for 6 months and thats it
[0:35:43] TheRATifier1: I think it was because they were all just roms.
[0:35:53] JTBun: nintendo is never good with emulation
[0:35:56] phatscout: yeah nintendo went hard in the fomo paint during the switch gen
[0:36:02] 1redpowern: pepole would have bought more!
[0:36:03] american_cookie_1: Mario got physical?
[0:36:05] vtuberacingcorp: PC port GOATed
[0:36:10] american_cookie_1: Wait…
[0:36:15] demon_dandy: I hear its just a meh port yeah lmao
[0:36:15] Returner7: yeah it was definitely a low effort port
[0:36:19] JTBun: PC port is really good and cool
[0:36:19] american_cookie_1: I worded something wrong…
[0:36:21] TheRATifier1: It is because that version patched the BLJ.
[0:36:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I did the PC port and its SUPER NICE
[0:36:34] KyuuMJ: I had no complaints from the N64
[0:36:35] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Can i link the princess peach meme @AshtonMarten
[0:36:36] Senoquese: imo the biggest problem is that they could have just done a virtual console 2 and put it all there instead of selling it as an actual game
[0:36:39] demon_dandy: Whys it called a pc port LMAO
[0:36:44] phatscout: if you're that worried about tripping over nintendo's ninja's, get a m64 cart and a dumper and you can play the pc port
[0:36:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: https://twitter.com/magdraws/status/1634294486804119552
[0:36:59] vtuberacingcorp: At the time the N64 virtual console didn't exist
[0:36:59] american_cookie_1: ashton51Bongo me bashing buttons to make Mario jump once
[0:37:01] 1redpowern: are these games even in the virtual console yet?
[0:37:02] phatscout: @demon_dandy... it's a decompiled PC port that has support for like all the cool shit
[0:37:03] Returner7: PC port was a fan straight up decompliation, they literally reversed engineered the original N64 rom
[0:37:07] JTBun: @demon_dandy someoen actually ported Mario 64 to the PC, not even emulation
[0:37:10] 1redpowern: why are you playng these versions then!?
[0:37:12] phatscout: ultrawide / 120fps / hdr
[0:37:24] demon_dandy: Ohhhh shit an actual port, i was unaware ashton51Pog
[0:37:31] phatscout: there's a fan remaster that tries to make it look like the SGI renders on the box and in promos
[0:37:54] demon_dandy: Im sure the port will be serviceable tho ashton51Tehe
[0:38:11] Returner7: yes yes, you'll know what it felt like for us when we were kids LMAO!
[0:38:14] Senoquese: well, i think mario 64 is rage inducing no matter the platform or version ashton51Tehe
[0:38:17] MonaMenagerie: WINGS?!?!?
[0:38:19] MonaMenagerie: OMG
[0:38:29] 1redpowern: can you fly with those wings?
[0:38:31] vanillascoop: I can hear the smile chiavtPog
[0:38:34] KyuuMJ: Good ole N64 graphics
[0:39:06] 1redpowern: toy story aged really well
[0:39:07] Hefewy9: It was realistic at the time!
[0:39:11] 1redpowern: it still looks amaizing
[0:39:17] demon_dandy: I remember i was watchin chii play m64 and she was DETERMINED to do cannonless (speedrun strat) and we spent hours tryin to learn it live
[0:39:31] american_cookie_1: I saw an old trailer for Minecraft on the 360 and I had a massive nostalgia blast
[0:39:32] Returner7: keep in mind, no other fully fleshed out 3d platformer existed before Super Mario 64
[0:39:38] 1redpowern: I MISS COLECTATHONS! theres been a bit of aresurgance latley but ts not enough I NEED MORE!
[0:39:44] KyuuMJ: Yep
[0:39:48] MonaMenagerie: i was one of those kids that would just play on the first world over and over
[0:39:55] rikkaonline: yeah it was genre defining, literally
[0:39:56] american_cookie_1: Disney Dinosaur still looks good, too
[0:39:56] metaconstruct: ya it was literally the first one
[0:40:01] vtuberacingcorp: Really it's more that everything else that tried was _awful_
[0:40:10] KyuuMJ: The PS1 did some "3D" fighting games
[0:40:31] KyuuMJ: Yes
[0:40:39] 1redpowern: i mean tekken started on ps1
[0:40:42] 1redpowern: and it was good
[0:40:48] rikkaonline: nintendo is the one that figured out how to do it right
[0:40:49] american_cookie_1: Huh. Didn’t know that. Neat
[0:40:51] KyuuMJ: Not in 3D
[0:40:52] vtuberacingcorp: It was the first good one, and that's not an exaggeration
[0:40:53] rikkaonline: 3d in general was new then
[0:41:00] KyuuMJ: SNES was not 3D capable
[0:41:04] rikkaonline: a lot of early 3d was really bad
[0:41:06] phatscout: Mario 64 wasn't the first 3d platformer, but the first GOOD one for sure
[0:41:10] behoimii: can't believe it took 64 mario games to become 3d
[0:41:12] 1redpowern: im pretty sure that most games had levels like crash bandicoot
[0:41:25] JTBun: summoning salt?
[0:41:25] 1redpowern: most 3d games, before mario 64
[0:41:25] phatscout: like Jumping Flash was a 3d platformer on PS1 and they tried to go with a weird FPS view
[0:41:33] phatscout: for a game primarily about jumping and shit
[0:41:50] demon_dandy: Mario kart speedrun vids are so tight ashton51Pog summoning salt?
[0:41:58] rikkaonline: doing any kind of 3d on snes required a whole extra cpu installed in the cartridge
[0:41:59] 1redpowern: speaking off if you wanna rage at an old game, play crash bandicoot 1
[0:42:01] 1redpowern: XD
[0:42:02] metaconstruct: abney ashton51Kneel
[0:42:10] phatscout: Tomb Raider was before Mario 64 and it was based around like tank controls and shit
[0:42:14] american_cookie_1: You know Doom? The first FPS with a Y-axis? It’s not 3D. It’s technically 2.5 D
[0:42:23] rikkaonline: n64/ps1/saturn was the same gen
[0:42:28] MonaMenagerie: oooh another really good 3d platformer is Ty the Tasmanian Tiger
[0:42:28] demon_dandy: How long you brushin your teeth ashton51Tensai
[0:42:33] phatscout: @american_cookie_1 Doom technically doesn't have a y-axis
[0:42:36] KyuuMJ: Doom... we couldn't aim "up"
[0:42:43] vanillascoop: AshtonMarten's toothbrush adventures ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin
[0:42:49] 1redpowern: i would understand when taking a shower...

[0:42:54] 1redpowern: oh there we go
[0:43:04] phatscout: well even then like, there's no y axis collision
[0:43:05] KyuuMJ: Someday, try original Doom.  Yes
[0:43:09] Hefewy9: Doom is definitely 100% worth playing
[0:43:11] phatscout: go watch  decino's vids for an explainer
[0:43:14] JTBun: Doom Eternal is amazing
[0:43:15] american_cookie_1: Ash Doom(1993) stream!

[0:43:28] american_cookie_1: It’s like $3 or something
[0:43:30] KyuuMJ: I played Doom 2 with a Sailor Moon mod

[0:44:06] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[0:44:09] american_cookie_1: Wasn’t Wolfenstien the FIRST FPS? Or close to being the first?
[0:44:12] phatscout: there were a FEW 3d platfomers on PS1 and all of them were varying degrees of jank and bad if foundational
[0:44:19] phatscout: @american_cookie_1 nope, but it was the first good one
[0:44:20] Hefewy9: PS1 was 1994, N64 was 1996
[0:44:23] 1redpowern: how long is in the morning?
[0:44:25] phatscout: @american_cookie_1 like faceball existed
[0:44:30] phatscout: it had lan play over the midi por
[0:44:30] KyuuMJ: @american_cookie_1 Yes, it was
[0:44:37] phatscout: it had lan play over the midi port
[0:44:37] demon_dandy: That sounds wrong to me too LMAO
[0:44:46] phatscout: hell wolf wasn't even id's first FPS, catacomb 3d was before it
[0:44:50] 1redpowern: jesus... being a woman is hard
[0:45:02] Returner7: yes before Super Mario 64, 3d platformers did not have the same freedom of motion/movement
[0:45:10] 1redpowern: i cant imagine taking more than 5 minutes to get ready for the day
[0:45:10] metaconstruct: it was sick
[0:45:11] rikkaonline: lan parties were so awesome

[0:45:49] JTBun: i'm a zoomer... never did that
[0:45:55] Hefewy9: Yeah it was awesome being in a cramped 95-degree room full of sweaty dudes
[0:46:10] phatscout: ngl sometimes I do that cringe "I was born in the wrong generation" thing cuz I was a zoomer in the post lan party generation
[0:46:13] 1redpowern: so we didint actually have lan partys but we had a cafe were we went after school to play counter strike over there, a bunch of us together
[0:46:21] KyuuMJ: These days - there are gamer cafes
[0:46:23] JTBun: but i do understand lugging around a CRT, I am a melee player
[0:46:30] metaconstruct: used to do that with xboxes quite a bit too
[0:46:30] Returner7: yeah lan parties as they use to be largely died out like 15-20 years ago
[0:46:31] phatscout: I went to a "lan party" in college once and everyone was just playing league over the internet and like... what's the point then
[0:46:34] american_cookie_1: “Mom, I’m carrying the TV to Cam’s house to play HALO LAN! Be back in three hours!”
[0:46:39] 0oGooseo0: The closest I came to that was lugging like a wii or GameCube around while riding a bike to someone's house
[0:46:52] science_mclovin: I had a ton of Halo 2 LAN parties back in the day. One friend had a projector so we played split screen on a huge white wall
[0:46:58] Hefewy9: LAN parties were fun but they were 100% a product of the times. Now you can just play games over Discord or w/e
[0:47:09] vtuberacingcorp: Computer kids were not cool like ever
[0:47:10] Cobalt_Ordinaire: maro
[0:47:18] 1redpowern: so we didn't actually have lan parties but we had a cafe were we went after school to play counter strike over there, a bunch of us together

[0:47:45] sausagevt: Yeah, you did have to do LAN before xbox live was a thing :3
[0:47:59] vtuberacingcorp: Halo 2 introduced xbox live
[0:48:02] american_cookie_1: There was a LAN party in a city near me last summer
[0:48:09] Cobalt_Ordinaire: yo, random question: who remembers the 3ds's Download Play, where you could host an entire Smash Bros round robin with only 10 people?
[0:48:20] science_mclovin: We linked 4 XBoxes together to play 16 player ashton51Dumpy

[0:56:47] rikkaonline: this was REVOLUTIONARY
[0:56:50] rikkaonline: just this screen
[0:56:52] Cobalt_Ordinaire: if I wanted to play SM64, I would've played the DS one.

[0:59:46] InsaneLoke: that cake is FUCKED up
[0:59:52] KyuuMJ: I must say: Why would Mario ever trust Lakitu with the camera?
[0:59:55] JustMaevyn: I love roguelikes too! Also, as for this game, yeah.. them controls be slippery feeling dimaaMonkee
[1:00:02] JTBun: @mrvacbob persona invented butterflies
[1:00:25] Hefewy9: this is pre-dual analog sticks
[1:00:33] rikkaonline: you can move the cameraback
[1:00:37] KyuuMJ: Long jump is the staple jump
[1:00:51] JTBun: yeah the camera isn't great
[1:00:58] KyuuMJ: That's not the long jump
[1:01:02] Returner7: yes there's a rhythm
[1:01:02] mrvacbob: yeah the graphics are off, they don't emulate N64 textures right so it's blurry
[1:01:02] Hefewy9: yeah theres timing
[1:01:03] demon_dandy: Makes sense since the camerman is legit an enemy type tehe ninoegTEHEPERO

[1:05:32] Senoquese: she doesnt know about L is real.........
[1:05:44] rikkaonline: totally $100% real confirmation that luigi is in thegame
[1:05:44] JTBun: it's just a meme lmao
[1:05:48] InsaneLoke: old game conspiracy
[1:05:54] Returner7: no back in the day, the pictures were so low res that one of those pictures looked like it said "L is real"
[1:05:58] JodanTheHero: That sign
[1:06:04] rikkaonline: you gotta squint
[1:06:06] InsaneLoke: on the plaque in low res
[1:06:11] Hefewy9: to explain: people always just speculated that Luigi was hidden in that area. Recently it was discovered that Luigi was ACTUALLY in the files this whole time
[1:06:14] Senoquese: that sign with the star supposedly says "L is real"
[1:06:20] demon_dandy: ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin
[1:06:22] KyuuMJ: FYI, I'm actually learning some of this stuff for the first time
[1:06:30] KyuuMJ: The memes, etc
[1:06:32] rikkaonline: the camera wants to be directly behind mario
[1:06:34] JodanTheHero: "L is Real 2701" iirc
[1:06:45] Senoquese: you can switch the camera to be marios view iirc?
[1:06:52] InsaneLoke: he will be real in 700 years
[1:06:57] demon_dandy: Lakitu is an enemy type and you gave him the camera chromu1JUST
[1:07:18] JodanTheHero: Apparently there was a long running rumor that if you got all the stars and 2701 coins, Luigi would become playable.
[1:07:27] KyuuMJ: Then there's Mario FPS view
[1:07:42] funnyplanet1: didnt play mario 1-63 Kappa
[1:07:43] InsaneLoke: he used to throw spikey guys in mario 3
[1:07:48] gravitypriest: oh shit its mar10 day

[1:08:48] Returner7: you need more forward momentum
[1:08:50] Returner7: for triple
[1:08:52] KyuuMJ: Y'need to be running
[1:08:52] Hefewy9: you gotta be moving forward
[1:09:02] JTBun: Lakitu's did hold the starting lights in Mario Kart before this game, so It kinda makes sense that they are are holding the camera
[1:09:04] demon_dandy: Side flip ashton51Pog
[1:09:08] JodanTheHero: It's tricky. You do a long jump, but as you leap forward, you pull back in the opposite direction.
[1:09:27] KyuuMJ: Oh right, the original Mario Kart
[1:09:42] JodanTheHero: I've only beaten the og mario kart once.

[1:13:21] JodanTheHero: *3D world space
[1:13:27] InsaneLoke: mario say: if you do drugs, you go to hell before you die, please

[1:17:09] gray_badge: Nunchunk?
[1:17:12] JodanTheHero: Skyward Sword?
[1:17:26] metaconstruct: idk its still hard on console maybe im bad
[1:17:30] Returner7: also OoT came out like 2-3 year after this game
[1:17:49] JTBun: I would love for you to play zelda

[1:34:32] KyuuMJ: This on a DS?  Interesting
[1:34:36] Senoquese: my hospital had ps2s but they only used them as dvd players ashton51Kneel
[1:34:40] TheRATifier1: Basically a remake for the DS
[1:34:46] TheRATifier1: More fun too.
[1:34:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah wasnt it super mario 64 DS?
[1:34:50] KyuuMJ: I'm not surprised
[1:34:52] JTBun: ds also had more characters
[1:34:55] gray_badge: Yeah, you could also play as Yoshi, Wario, and Luigi in the DS Remake
[1:34:59] sausagevt: no, you can use the warp point but he'll say you cheated and won't give you the star
[1:35:02] Returner7: talk to the buddies!!!
[1:35:08] Returner7: they'll open the hatches!
[1:35:08] KyuuMJ: Oh, talk to the pink bombs

[1:35:16] Kitkattack: I played an gameshark version of this on DS
[1:35:19] sausagevt: GOOBER
[1:35:22] gray_badge: Oh, I remember you being able to use it
[1:35:30] JodanTheHero: Each character even has their own power-ups
[1:35:47] gray_badge: He just ate his vegetables to get bigger
[1:35:49] TheRATifier1: @Kitkattack wow gameshark? I'm so old and I'm only 23
[1:36:09] Returner7: yes you need to talk to the buddies to activate the canons!!!
[1:36:11] JTBun: yeah game shark or lightning replay lmao
[1:36:39] sausagevt: fun fact, the reason koopa the quick is so big is because he shows up later on Tiny Huge Island and he says that its his home, so thats why he's so huge :3
[1:36:43] demon_dandy: Ds had luigi and wario right?
[1:36:55] sausagevt: it had Yoshi too :3
[1:37:00] gray_badge: @demon_dandy Yep, and Yoshi too

[1:37:09] TheRATifier1: R4i**
[1:37:16] Senoquese: and ds wario had the exclusive skill of being able to fuck up signs
[1:37:17] JodanTheHero: I did actually rage at the DS version because I couldn't beat Bowser. I ended up breaking my DS.
[1:37:24] sausagevt: omg Ashton the DS version also had these amazing minigames
[1:37:27] gray_badge: Luigi's my favorite Mario character, so I was happy to play as him in it
[1:37:34] KyuuMJ: lol

[1:37:45] Returner7: yes
[1:37:51] JodanTheHero: My anger is much better now.
[1:37:55] sausagevt: hey btw, how are you playing this right now :3
[1:38:01] KyuuMJ: My DS is still barely intact
[1:38:06] demon_dandy: Id never break my ds ashton51Tehe but id definitely lose it somewhere so im no better
[1:38:17] gravitypriest: there is a secret~
[1:38:21] rikkaonline: the chain is holdinghim back...
[1:38:23] gray_badge: Luigi also has gambling mini games in the DS game
[1:38:26] Returner7: you need to use the ground pound
[1:38:34] KyuuMJ: I'm still amazed at the longevity of the DS battery though
[1:38:39] sausagevt: this part gives me so much anxiety
[1:38:40] demon_dandy: Chainchomp footsies ashton51Pog ashton51Pog

[1:39:36] demon_dandy: Chain chomps are cute ashton51Tehe
[1:39:44] gray_badge: I learned how to play blackjack because of the DS mini games
[1:39:55] JodanTheHero: Unironically, I ended up *kinda* breaking another DS a couple years later, but it still works.
[1:40:05] demon_dandy: They had blackjack on the ds mario 64?? ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:40:07] sausagevt: miyamoto based them on a dog that used to chase him on his bike lol
[1:40:15] gravitypriest: fella you gotta be more gentle with those DSs
[1:40:18] demon_dandy: LMAO trueee
[1:40:24] gray_badge: @demon_dandy Yeah, it was one of Luigi's mini games
[1:40:30] JTBun: they got the dog in them...
[1:40:30] JodanTheHero: I inadvertently demoted it to a GBA because the top screen broke.
[1:40:40] demon_dandy: @gray_badge thats siiiiick
[1:40:41] sausagevt: if you pause you can see :3
[1:41:07] gray_badge: @demon_dandy It was pretty much the only card game in it I was any good at
[1:41:17] sausagevt: I HATE THIS RED COIN
[1:41:20] sausagevt: IT SUCKS I HATE IT
[1:41:21] Returner7: you can crawl up that hill!

[1:42:33] KyuuMJ: Chillin' with the bob omb
[1:42:44] demon_dandy: Drink water upside down works everytime for me ashton51Tensai
[1:42:49] KyuuMJ: Peace loving!
[1:43:05] JodanTheHero: Human Cannonball time!
[1:43:09] gray_badge: Why do they have cannons if they don't use them?
[1:43:26] JodanTheHero: They launch fireworks
[1:43:38] sausagevt: are you playing this on switch? :3
[1:43:40] KyuuMJ: They gave up their life of war
[1:44:13] Returner7: look for more cannons!!!
[1:44:16] JodanTheHero: Try the one on the mountain
[1:44:37] gray_badge: It could be a different Koopa
[1:44:42] Kalvin1225: Hi how are you doing ?
[1:44:44] sausagevt: I don't think I've ever played this game in HD before this release, so it REALLY catches me off guard when Mario's polygons get less detailed when the camera zooms out lol
[1:44:44] JodanTheHero: SHELL SURF
[1:44:48] KyuuMJ: You stole his clothes
[1:44:50] Senoquese: iirc most world textures are just stock images recolored and cropped
[1:44:58] sausagevt: you're just skatin' around :3
[1:45:28] sausagevt: yeah unfortunately they don't put it in the koopa the quick level xD
[1:45:29] gray_badge: You stripped that poor Koopa of his clothes and dignity
[1:45:55] Kalvin1225: I'm good you're too cute
[1:46:02] sausagevt: your so good omg
[1:46:04] Senoquese: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:46:07] KyuuMJ: Easy
[1:46:12] gravitypriest: EZ MODO
[1:46:12] JustMaevyn: First try pomatoDAB
[1:46:30] sausagevt: now you have to go all the way over there and get that star :<
[1:46:34] JodanTheHero: Those require a special switch.
[1:46:44] JodanTheHero: Maybe you'll find it one day.
[1:46:47] sausagevt: def get the other one so you don't have to do it again lol
[1:46:54] demon_dandy: She beat her old record poggg ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:46:57] Returner7: I'd get the red coin one first, it's more painful to reacquire
[1:47:05] KyuuMJ: New Record
[1:47:08] gravitypriest: HEREWEGOOOOOOOO
[1:47:15] sausagevt: I think theres a mod of this game that lets you collect all the stars without having it boot you out of the world
[1:47:26] JTBun: this is a fast PB ashton51Pog
[1:47:27] JodanTheHero: ^ That sounds great!
[1:47:39] JodanTheHero: @sausagevt Sounds great!
[1:47:52] sausagevt: I think its called like, Mario 64 odyssey or something
[1:47:53] KyuuMJ: Galaxy - y'leave the world too
[1:47:57] JodanTheHero: No, Mario Galaxy kicked you out of the level too
[1:48:08] gray_badge: @sausagevt How does it work with the courses where things change depending on the Star chosen?
[1:48:13] Navy_Mongoose: Evening, bing bings
[1:48:13] Returner7: you need to use the ground pound for chain chomp
[1:48:16] rikkaonline: different stars have different level setups
[1:48:20] JodanTheHero: Odyssey might've been the inspiration.
[1:48:25] sausagevt: @gray_badge I have NO idea I just know it exists xD
[1:48:40] sausagevt: maybe they just put all the elements in the level at once maybe?
[1:48:42] gray_badge: Banjo-Kazooie didn't kick you out when you got a Jiggy, maybe you were thinking of that?
[1:49:05] sausagevt: I'm trying to not tell you how to do anything xD <3
[1:49:08] Navy_Mongoose: Yeah, Banjo Kazooie keeps you in
[1:49:30] demon_dandy: Its prob better you start with mario? In theory at least ashton51Tehe
[1:49:33] Kitkattack: Collecta-thon games are wtv
[1:49:35] KyuuMJ: You made the shot
[1:49:35] sausagevt: NOOOO its really fun watching people discover how to play it :3
[1:49:38] JustMaevyn: I think you aimed at the sun pomatoTHONK
[1:49:44] Senoquese: if u press jump as mario you go yip yap wahoo bing bam ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:49:52] JTBun: it's just simple physics ash 4head
[1:49:52] JodanTheHero: I'm thinking the mod probably changes and loads the assets required for stars that change the world itself as you get them. Like, you collect the first, and then it loads the necessary things for the next?
[1:49:57] JTBun: 4Head
[1:50:03] JustMaevyn: @Senoquese gasp, how dare u spoil things /s
[1:50:06] demon_dandy: Trueee ashton51Tensai
[1:50:09] DoctorDreads: Hi Ashton
[1:50:11] DoctorDreads: Hi chat
[1:50:15] Navy_Mongoose: You need to maximize your A-Press efficiency
[1:50:15] sausagevt: for some reason in the 3d all stars version of this game marios ass is really pronounced
[1:50:26] gray_badge: The control stick is how you move
[1:50:37] demon_dandy: Poifect ashton51Pog
[1:50:39] DoctorDreads: Happy Friday!
[1:50:45] KyuuMJ: lol
[1:50:50] sausagevt: I hate the n64 control stick so much lol
[1:50:53] sausagevt: I HATE it lol
[1:50:53] JodanTheHero: It sounds unstable, but what do I know about modding and coding, yeah? aurumOWO
[1:51:05] KyuuMJ: Yea, the N64 controller was.. yea
[1:51:18] sausagevt: it was really, REALLY stiff
[1:51:21] Returner7: on the three hands one!!!
[1:51:22] Navy_Mongoose: Thats NES
[1:51:24] KyuuMJ: It was a "3 handle" thing
[1:51:25] JodanTheHero: To be fair, I don't know a lot of things. I just guess.
[1:51:27] rikkaonline: n64 controller had three handles
[1:51:30] sausagevt: noooo, it had like, 3 grips it made no sense
[1:51:35] Navy_Mongoose: N64 was for 3-handed people
[1:51:37] MuttleyStrikeout: block is nes dogbone is snes
[1:51:37] gray_badge: It had 3 handles
[1:51:41] demon_dandy: 64 was the one with the tripod ashton51Tehe
[1:51:51] JTBun: I'll be explaining exactly what I do to collect Watch for Rolling Rocks in 0.5 A presses. But first, we need to clear something up.
[1:51:52] Senoquese: you switch grip depending on the game
[1:51:54] KyuuMJ: The left handle - I never really knew what that was for, lol
[1:51:57] Navy_Mongoose: Just gripd either the middle or the left
[1:51:58] rikkaonline: you used a different one for you left hand depending if you wanted d pad or control stick
[1:52:07] MuttleyStrikeout: youre telling us you dont have a third hand
[1:52:10] gray_badge: The NES controller always felt so nice to hold
[1:52:13] demon_dandy: Id always hold the analogue stick and it worked for like 90% of games
[1:52:16] KyuuMJ: I actually never used the Dpad
[1:52:26] demon_dandy: Same kyuu
[1:52:32] JodanTheHero: The only acceptable way to hold an N64 controller is left hand on the middle and right hand on the right.
[1:52:42] Returner7: so primarily u grip the middle and right for 3d games or the left and right for 2d games for N64 , that was the design intention at least
[1:52:44] demon_dandy: ninoegWHATTHE
[1:52:49] Navy_Mongoose: I only used the D-pad for Pokemon Stadium and when I did I thought it was weird
[1:52:53] KyuuMJ: I still like how the painting kicks out Mario hard
[1:53:01] sausagevt: the left grip had a d pad, the middle one had the joystick, and the left grip had face buttons. I think their idea was "if a game required d pad for movement you can use the left grip but if it required joystick, you can use the middle) but MOST games on the N64 required the joystick so you always had to hold it awkwardly
[1:53:06] Returner7: the middle had the analog stick
[1:53:08] rikkaonline: the z trigger was under the middle one
[1:53:08] JodanTheHero: Kicks you out of the world and kicks a life out of you.
[1:53:10] sausagevt: *right grip
[1:53:11] KyuuMJ: Yea
[1:53:16] demon_dandy: Holding the middle one was actually comfy to me
[1:53:18] KyuuMJ: The middle had the Z-button
[1:53:27] gray_badge: Kirby 64 was the only N64 game I used the D-pad for
[1:53:42] Kitkattack: middle grip DansGame
[1:53:52] KyuuMJ: Even Mischief Makers, I used the stick
[1:53:52] SeisoCat_: Hello
[1:54:03] Navy_Mongoose: Once you used the analod stick you knew gaming was going to be different from then on
[1:54:06] gravitypriest: rainbow  six used dpad too i think
[1:54:10] JodanTheHero: I only had the two Zeldas for N64, so no d-pad for me
[1:54:18] demon_dandy: Shes gettin shamoned ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:54:22] Returner7: @gray_badge yeah there were like 1 or 2 more, but the 2d config was not used often
[1:54:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:54:32] JTBun: YES LMAO
[1:54:32] Senoquese: rainbow six siege ashton51Omega ashton51Omega ashton51Omega ashton51Omega
[1:54:33] vtuberacingcorp: lol
[1:54:34] sausagevt: also, this is just a random fun fact, donkey kong 64 had a random, game breaking bug in it that the developers had NO idea how to fix, and they couldn't figure it out before launch, and the only way to fix it was with this little ram extension you put in your n64, so they had to ship every copy with a ram extension and they actually lost money on every copy lol
[1:54:35] gravitypriest: rainbow six is a long-running game series
[1:54:36] vtuberacingcorp: lmao even
[1:54:37] gravitypriest: since like 1997
[1:54:40] Navy_Mongoose: Zoooooooom
[1:54:48] Returner7: yes Rainbow Six is a long standing video game series!!!
[1:54:53] demon_dandy: Rainbow six is ps1/n64 ashton51Tehe

[1:54:57] JodanTheHero: Rainbow Six was on N64??
[1:54:57] rikkaonline: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[1:55:00] gravitypriest: rainbow six is an FPS game series yeah
[1:55:00] phatscout: Rainbow Six was originally a book
[1:55:04] phatscout: then an old timey shooter
[1:55:07] gravitypriest: the first one was on PC, N64, and PS1
[1:55:07] phatscout: and now esports

[2:02:54] gravitypriest: he died a few years ago yeah

[2:06:18] Returner7: LMAO
[2:06:30] KyuuMJ: OMG spoilers

[2:06:55] Navy_Mongoose: I'm laughing so hard my dog thinks there's something wrong with me
[2:07:03] Senoquese: didnt ben shapiro play mario kart? i wonder if ashton could beat him
[2:07:04] Returner7: they probably made them round to save on polygons, the originals had a ton of spikes right?
[2:07:05] phatscout: along side the guy who made drizzit and the dude who used to pitch for red sox
[2:07:12] demon_dandy: Cannonless ashton51Pog

[2:07:50] vtuberacingcorp: I usually go for red coin when I get stuck
[2:07:55] sausagevt: the way mario moves in this game is weird. If you try to turn right, Mario will literally start to walk in a circle in the right direction instead of just having his body snap to the right. it feels weird lol
[2:08:05] JodanTheHero: Theoretically, you can do any Star you like when you enter a level, until the game says so.
[2:08:20] demon_dandy: Todd clancy discovered the beach thst makes you old NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:08:21] Returner7: you can on some, but a decent amount are blocked by previous stars or require an unlocked cap to get
[2:08:27] sausagevt: I will say, there is a star in this level that is ACTUAL bullshit and is cryptic as fuck.

[2:11:13] Returner7: No Lollipop Chainsaw!!! LMAO!
[2:11:14] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe

[2:11:24] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:11:32] sausagevt: Nintendo doesn't put their games on pc lol
[2:11:34] demon_dandy: Yeah the music is getting neutered ashton51Tehe

[2:12:40] Kitkattack: hella vibe
[2:12:41] sausagevt: mario is just a silly little man
[2:12:41] rikkaonline: polygons dont grow on trees
[2:12:45] phatscout: n64 famously had no texture resolution
[2:12:49] milkmanatee11: good
[2:12:54] demon_dandy: @kawaiicrew4ever theres always some time for fun ashton51Heh
[2:12:55] KyuuMJ: N64 relied on sprites
[2:12:59] phatscout: which is why you have a lot blurrier textures compared to the PS1
[2:13:04] sausagevt: fun fact, narwhal horns are actually a big tooth :3
[2:13:14] phatscout: but the PS1 had the warble
[2:13:29] thezombiemagnate: I couldn't Finish the 3rd chapter in Killer is Dead, The last part vs the Guy on the Moon wouldn't Function Right.
[2:13:37] sausagevt: I think its like, the graphics would wobble around?
[2:13:39] Navy_Mongoose: the laser wobbled
[2:13:39] vtuberacingcorp: The vertices move around because they clamp to integers
[2:13:40] phatscout: no the vertexes wobble around
[2:13:44] demon_dandy: Its like the classic ps1 ibbling
[2:13:57] sausagevt: apparently the laser would get fried on the ps1 over time
[2:13:59] demon_dandy: ninoegNERDGE
[2:14:03] phatscout: @vtuberacingcorp half that and have the hardware not even having perspective correct texturing
[2:14:05] funnyplanet1: ohhh the ps1 snivelling
[2:14:05] kawaiicrew4ever: fake ass words
[2:14:16] sausagevt: yeah :3
[2:14:19] Navy_Mongoose: in retrospect, the PS1 was very weird
[2:14:27] sausagevt: ever catch your earphones on the edge of your desk
[2:14:36] Kitkattack: the low poly sprites wiggles
[2:14:37] phatscout: @vtuberacingcorp iirc both of these being a factor is why you can dewarble some games in emulators but cant with others
[2:14:42] thezombiemagnate: I had a PS1, I remember it GRINDING discs while playing tgem
[2:14:43] Navy_Mongoose: CDs were the future, but there were some funny gimmicks about it
[2:14:54] Senoquese: did you know mario 64 was only like 320x240? you wouldnt be able to see SHIT

[2:16:31] sausagevt: its this collection of horror games in the style of ps1 games you can download :3
[2:17:00] Navy_Mongoose: MGS was somewhat of a reboot of the Metal Gear series, which was also weird as a game
[2:17:04] gravitypriest: its very funny on the gamecube remake because psycho mantis is like YOU LIKE TO PLAY SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE
[2:17:05] vtuberacingcorp: todd would later go on to make Skyrim 8 times

[2:17:06] demon_dandy: @sausagevt spectral mall right?? I tried to get her to play for halloween ashton51Tehe
[2:17:08] phatscout: normies call themselves hardcore gamers and then get filtered by irritating stick on ps1
[2:17:18] Navy_Mongoose: as AVGN put it, video games were about killing the bad guys, Metal Gear was about not fighting at all
[2:17:19] Returner7: six plus 100 coin star in each

[2:50:07] gravitypriest: in super mario world there were switch palaces where you would activate switches to enable power ups in the entire game. this is the equivalent of that
[2:50:14] sausagevt: now bobomb battlefield has the wing cap in it :3
[2:50:23] demon_dandy: To be fair i always did this level way after the good ones LMAO

[2:51:32] Returner7: yeah this one is pretty aggravating
[2:51:36] KyuuMJ: Maintain a 5 degree glide slope
[2:51:40] demon_dandy: Shrimple as that ninoegNERDGE
[2:51:47] sausagevt: flying is kind of like racing a car in the air :3
[2:52:02] KyuuMJ: Flight has a limited time
[2:52:04] sausagevt: its timed :3
[2:52:05] Zerorush: It runs out eventually
[2:52:05] Returner7: the caps have a time limit!
[2:52:06] Navy_Mongoose: powerups don't last forever
[2:52:08] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[2:52:29] sausagevt: its okay you're still doing your best :3
[2:52:32] KyuuMJ: Btw, the glide is a constant decent
[2:52:39] Navy_Mongoose: oh yeah, I'm now remembering when MArio made me motion sick

[2:53:00] sausagevt: mario gets dragged down by his fat dumpy
[2:53:18] demon_dandy: Yeah they were NOT cookin with this level ashton51Tensai
[2:53:21] Navy_Mongoose: tilt down for speed, tilt up for altitude
[2:53:26] Returner7: it's more like a glider, you never really gain altitude!
[2:53:27] rikkaonline: when you start the level you have to go around to hit all the loops
[2:53:27] Navy_Mongoose: come back to it later
[2:53:30] sausagevt: this level is basically impossible if  you fall onto the platform
[2:53:32] vtuberacingcorp: skill issue tbh
[2:53:36] KyuuMJ: Y'don't gain altitude

[3:44:51] sausagevt: Lives in general were just a way for you to pump more quarters into the machine. Then when home consoles became a thing, lives and difficulty were a means to artificially lengthen the game, because otherwise kids would beat the game too quickly and not feel like they got their moneys worth
