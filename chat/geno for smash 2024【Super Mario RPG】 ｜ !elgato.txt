[0:12:52] anonsama9001: ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly ashton51Wiggly
[0:13:05] SurfaceTenshi: NICE
[0:13:16] SurfaceTenshi: dude you should try type4, its just as good if not better
[0:13:20] Kitkattack: Yeah you are ashton51Stare
[0:13:25] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Stare

[0:13:45] suzuniyukai: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[0:14:04] SurfaceTenshi: thats fair! but i dont think ridge racer has a linear narrative
[0:14:07] horribleham: Ashton needs the lore of ridge racer to remain INTACT
[0:14:10] ApocalypseSC: LUL
[0:14:20] suzuniyukai: Some series are messy tho!!! and have weird timelines
[0:14:24] ApocalypseSC: type 4 is p goated though
[0:14:25] anonsama9001: that is good logic, TM2 is the only exception i can think of
[0:14:27] SurfaceTenshi: ridge racer type 4 is great tho
[0:14:29] HashiriyaR32: I think the only PS-era Ridge Racer I played was Type 4.  Played it on PSP because PSN was handing it out for free.
[0:14:40] Kitkattack: it's usually the case that sequels improve upon the last entries
[0:14:43] T33bags: i picked the second goemon n64 game for my redeem... but i dont think you need to know the first one LMAO
[0:14:46] ReyJaggy: hi
[0:14:47] SurfaceTenshi: @HashiriyaR32 it was on the psp? i had no idea fangguEye
[0:14:55] ReyJaggy: Play ridge 3 electric boogaloo
[0:14:58] HashiriyaR32: First Ridge Racer game I played was ALSO the first PSP game
[0:15:12] horribleham: I agree with Ashton, because even if a series skips around in time, it clearly does that intentionally with you having the knowledge of previous or following events.
[0:15:15] HashiriyaR32: You can play PSX games on PSP
[0:15:19] ApocalypseSC: it's psx originally
[0:15:24] SurfaceTenshi: well, its not for the psp, it was just rereleased for it. it was a playstation 1 game
[0:15:24] Kitkattack: you could totally launch into the Metal Gear series where ever you want
[0:15:32] HashiriyaR32: There are actually 2 PSP Ridge Racer entries
[0:15:36] HashiriyaR32: in hte mid-2000s
[0:15:43] Returner7: P3P was probably the best version of P3
[0:16:02] Burr11: lmao of course she's only interested in it being yaoi coded ashton51Tehe
[0:16:48] horribleham: I'm still confused what the difference between the psp and the vita was sulfur12Think
[0:16:51] HashiriyaR32: Stuck in a plot tunnel theN?
[0:16:52] HashiriyaR32: *then?
[0:17:01] ReyJaggy: is this why she grabs us by the tail?
[0:17:09] Burr11: the ezio games had really good story actually
[0:17:17] Burr11: and then they just ran it into the ground
[0:17:51] Burr11: oh yeah
[0:17:58] Burr11: escort speed so ass
[0:17:59] Kitkattack: escort missions
[0:18:09] Kitkattack: the bane of a lot of video games

[0:41:11] Kitkattack: I would think really main stream ones like them would be in super high demand to justify that pricing
[0:41:15] Returner7: lol I'm a weeb too, but idol stuff never resonated w/ me
[0:41:32] rikkaonline: same
[0:41:35] kyle__senpai: I don't think you can get into vtubers and not be a weeb

[0:43:51] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: hololive is my no. 1 comedy obsession
[0:44:03] Burr11: i mean i like idolmaster too i guess, but just the anime
[0:44:13] rikkaonline: if its what you want to do, you should do it

[0:47:03] anonsama9001: i usually duck out on singing streams for most vtubers but i make an exception for ashton and one other
[0:47:09] Moikoi: I feel that having that freedom really does give more space for new and creative content
[0:47:27] chinwillach: I love helping the underdog so I gravitate towards indies
[0:47:36] chinwillach: And yea I feel ya there Ashie

[0:49:00] kyle__senpai: It's complicated. I enjoy how candid you are and I've been more attracted to indies than Hololive recently. But then again Holo EN isn't super strict about the idol stuff. I think there's a balance to be had.

[1:27:19] suzuniyukai: im getting old ashton51Wah 2010???
[1:27:22] carpenter_bee__: How did you get introduced to anime? what anime do you Rec to get people aqainted ?
[1:27:34] the_ol_regular: @carpenter_bee__ Inuyasha for me
[1:27:39] kyle__senpai: @suzuniyukai 2010 was 30 years ago
[1:27:39] AlyulaCastor: PEACH ashton51Squish
[1:28:11] Burr11: i dont think there's one anime for everyone
[1:28:23] Burr11: try to find what non anime stuff they like and find an anime that scratches the same itch imo
[1:28:30] rikobutepic: Bebop?
[1:28:31] Navy_Mongoose: @carpenter_bee__ probably depends on Genre
[1:28:31] steel_valiant: @carpenter_bee__ It really depends on what kind of movies/shows they like
[1:28:33] the_ol_regular: Just do anime
[1:28:35] kyle__senpai: Baccano is solid
[1:28:35] themaxer__: sword art
[1:28:36] behoimii: death note?
[1:28:39] Navy_Mongoose: Cowboy Bebop

[1:29:09] kyle__senpai: Maybe a movie. Vampire Hunter D?
[1:29:12] suzuniyukai: i saw someone start with attack on titan and that got them somehow..
[1:29:12] carpenter_bee__: bebop has some western influence, so it’ll be less of a culture shock hmm
[1:29:16] Navy_Mongoose: Nichijou because it's easy to just pick up and get
[1:29:19] ApocalypseSC: my first was samurai champloo
[1:29:27] steel_valiant: Aye, FMA: Brotherhood is a great entry level anime
[1:29:29] Burr11: nichijou has too much japanese kind of humor..
[1:29:33] rikobutepic: I wish I could recommend Jojo to anyone
[1:29:40] kyle__senpai: @navy_mongoose not at all. Very random, referential
[1:29:42] Tazzle_Ch: Japanese humor is hard to understand to normies
[1:29:51] the_ol_regular: Fine, NGE
[1:29:55] the_ol_regular: Take it or leave it
[1:29:58] rikobutepic: Anime requires so much trope knowledge
[1:30:04] Navy_Mongoose: I guess I'm just more open to absurdist stuff
[1:30:05] suzuniyukai: i love some parts of jojo but idk if i'd recommend it for a first anime

[2:01:17] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, you'd think Megazord would get a lot more done if he was first in line
[2:02:56] carpenter_bee__: @returner7  you could blend some frozen bananas up and mix it with vanilla ice cream
[2:03:02] chinwillach: It hits hard but it's nothing you can't heal matcha54Santa
[2:03:29] Navy_Mongoose: I eat bananas every morning ashton51Stare

[2:04:36] carpenter_bee__: who is this wizard nerd that’s working with Mario in this
[2:04:45] rikkaonline: fake banana flavor is like old bananas i think

[2:04:48] Navy_Mongoose: Mallow
[2:04:49] Burr11: lol
[2:04:51] Kitkattack: mmmm oh man I haven't fried plantains in ages
[2:04:55] newdlebomb: mario looks like a gingerbread man in this game
[2:04:55] Burr11: you just got on her bad side
[2:04:57] Returner7: supposedly, because all modern store bananas are clones
[2:04:59] Kitkattack: NERD ninoegNERDGE
[2:05:02] carpenter_bee__: OH! I read a wiki page about that
[2:05:06] Moikoi: moikoiPog

[2:06:26] ApocalypseSC: lmao
[2:06:33] Moikoi: Thats too much for nintentdo LUL

[2:06:54] Moikoi: @JTBun fr
[2:07:12] chinwillach: ashton51Stare
[2:07:25] carpenter_bee__: they grew bananas by shoots instead of seeds since it was easier, but there was no genetic diversity and a disease killed off the entire population, a new species was grown in its place and they didn’t learn at all from it btw it’s still grown by shoots
[2:07:37] ApocalypseSC: that was a strong hmpf
[2:07:52] Navy_Mongoose: This is where you get Signal Ring in the original
[2:08:08] carpenter_bee__: lucky mallo to be given a swirly by you ashton51Love

[2:10:55] chinwillach: Time to put your thinking visor on
[2:10:58] Navy_Mongoose: inb4 it's above the already opened chest
[2:11:04] carpenter_bee__: chinchillas are gravely endangered in their native habitat, the pet trade is helping to secure the species survival imo
[2:11:17] Moikoi: Love the ost swuibb1comfy
[2:11:19] Burr11: only spot you havent tried
[2:11:20] carpenter_bee__: like hamsters are completely dependent on the pet trade for survival
[2:11:29] Burr11: ashton51Cheer
[2:11:30] T33bags: its only unethical because theyre more high maintenance than a lot of people expect them to be/capable of
[2:11:56] fruitbatMari: It's sad how species are only preserved through the pet trade :(
[2:11:59] Navy_Mongoose: should I adopt a rodent or a rottweiler?

[2:18:27] Navy_Mongoose: should be directly above a block
[2:20:20] Navy_Mongoose: they are connected now
[2:21:12] Navy_Mongoose: it's a tricky jump, especially now since it isn't as obvious
[2:21:30] rikkaonline: just a stronger version
[2:22:12] Navy_Mongoose: Not AS obvious. There's a shadow on the base floor that isn't as clear in the remake
[2:22:56] Navy_Mongoose: the shadow in the original just tells hints where to jump from
[2:23:00] kyle__senpai: Masher room
[2:23:11] chinwillach: Asher Marten
