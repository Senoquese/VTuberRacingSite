[3:49:13] Wirebrain: So originally, there was no japanese voice overs, it was all english to give it that american B-movie feel. Even the Japanese ads were trying to be an american horror action movie with getting George "Night of the Living Dead" Romero to direct it.

[3:51:45] Navy_Mongoose: their support character is different, but they do the same puzzles
[3:51:49] Wirebrain: Yeah. But they did learn something from the first game. They actually got english speakers to properly localize the script. Unlike the first game where they just directly translated it from Japanese to English. Thus "Master of Unlocking" or "Jill Sandwich".
[3:51:50] demon_dandy: Re1 its minor changes, kinda upped in the remake but its like alternate tellings of the same story
