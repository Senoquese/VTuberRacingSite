[0:28:12] Senoquese: @tripsout2 average collab tbf
[0:28:14] Romblymo: I have trouble hitting on people who are so interesting, I tend to just lay out how funny and appealing they are
[0:28:15] astroshenanigans: had no idea that was the term for that
[0:28:18] JTBun: @tripsout2 10000% ture
[0:28:19] tripsout2: LMAOO CALLED IT
[0:28:22] buruhas: TRUE
[0:28:25] redactedenheim: yep
[0:28:32] JTBun: trip knows you TOO well
[0:28:33] demon_dandy: Flirt
[0:28:36] DavidPortnov: The power dynamics!
[0:28:38] sparks0s: i may like feet but i dislike people  being overly agressive
[0:28:38] TheMoatman: Stepping is barely ryo- I mean I've never heard of that before
[0:28:43] InsaneLoke: you talk big game but if someone pushes back you roll over and show ur belly
[0:28:47] redactedenheim: this reminds me of a blue oyster cult song
[0:28:47] Romblymo: She is the switch extremes
[0:28:50] Kitkattack: you really do lock into big sis mode sometimes on collabs
[0:28:51] astroshenanigans: wow, this stream is starting off wild

[0:29:19] InsaneLoke: @TheMoatman waaaait trueeee
[0:29:20] rodetovenaar: I can't try to rizz you up, Ashton. You're one of my oshi's, and that's an unbreakable barrier a little chilla like me wouldn't dare to cross.
[0:29:37] Senoquese: hey more for me ill rizz my oshi
[0:29:41] InsaneLoke: id cross that barrier
[0:29:45] yojamjam: ashton has mikoshiba syndrome
[0:30:01] applecadough: alliWave
[0:30:01] DavidPortnov: I'll leave the rizz to everyone else.
[0:30:04] rodetovenaar: I just like to enjoy Ashton respectfully from afar
[0:30:09] Romblymo: As a fellow switch I approve of this
[0:30:19] DavidPortnov: @rodetovenaar  🤝
[0:30:21] InsaneLoke: #Nintendo
[0:30:23] applecadough: What is ur favorite pickup line
[0:30:24] Romblymo: One of us
[0:30:26] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:30:28] TheMoatman: I wouldn't rizz you up because I just can't see you that way. It just feels wrong.
[0:30:29] Kitkattack: i can't
[0:30:35] yojamjam: yeah he says like one cool thing then gets embarrassed
[0:30:41] Burr11: ashton's too cool for me i havent seen as many anime as her
[0:30:45] tripsout2: ashton51Hehe  asks to get rizzed, gets flustered, we won
[0:30:48] w0wells: Switch so cool they made the switch 2
[0:30:58] astroshenanigans: i learned howw rizz from biboo proposing to nerissa
[0:31:00] JTBun: well i dont know how to
[0:31:01] HuckFinn__: Are you crazy girl because I can be your straightjacket (that's all I got, goodnight folks)
[0:31:03] Burr11: ashton51Omegalul
[0:31:08] timinator193: Too afraid to parasocial
[0:31:14] Romblymo: I can't do pickups, you're like one of those really interesting and cute people that I'd just approach with the hand on the table
[0:31:19] Kitkattack: lol do you just want compliments?
[0:31:22] timinator193: ashton51Heh What if it works?
[0:31:30] rodetovenaar: I would run away like the prey I am
[0:31:30] Senoquese: i mean i say ill rizz you but my closest thing to rizzing is being autistic and then posting a new chilla gif like ashton51Bongo ashy look
[0:31:31] outrunthewind: I'm desperately short on rizz on a good day, being sick doesn't help
[0:31:37] eb0ss1: i thought about coming up with a pickup line but yeah youre too imouto-core to me LMAO
[0:31:41] buruhas: "FLIRT BACK GOD DAMNIT"
[0:31:45] rikkaonline: no
[0:31:46] DavidPortnov: "Are you a factory in the Industrial Revolution? Because I want to put some kids in you."
[0:31:48] timinator193: @buruhas ashton51Omegalul
[0:31:50] demon_dandy: No way ICANT
[0:31:53] rodetovenaar: I used pickup lines when I was in the navy
[0:31:54] redactedenheim: "Single coil or humbucker?"
[0:31:56] Kitkattack: no friggin way
[0:31:57] Red__2: not at all IRL
[0:31:58] TheMoatman: An actual known pickup line? Only as a joke.
[0:31:58] JTBun: i feel like thats so cheesy
[0:31:58] w0wells: No waaaay lol
[0:31:59] outrunthewind: I don't go to bars
[0:32:01] Romblymo: No, if it's the vibe I just chat flirtily I guess
[0:32:03] HuckFinn__: You mean to tell us there are girls offline?
[0:32:03] InsaneLoke: pickup lines are basically yo mama jokes. they arent functional
[0:32:10] sparks0s: Hey girl uhhhhh nice uhh face
[0:32:15] Senoquese: thats true
[0:32:19] rodetovenaar: It's cheesy but it helps if you're in uniform
[0:32:19] DavidPortnov: Yeah, true.
[0:32:22] StreamElements: Welcome to my Winter Break Donothon, pit crew!!! I'm streaming every day until January 4th to raise money for my upcoming projects in 2026. Wanna help me out? Let it snow here: https://streamelements.com/ashtonmarten/tip ❄
[0:32:24] tripsout2: i told the goth girl she stole my attention and that seemed to work doobyErm
[0:32:25] eb0ss1: my go-to line is "I'm a huge weeb wbu"
[0:32:26] Kitkattack: yeah that's valid, incredible archaic
[0:32:26] sparks0s: Omg that makes sense
[0:32:31] demon_dandy: My cousin did but he was attractive so it would work and it was soooo ashton51Cringe
[0:32:33] DavidPortnov: Nice!
[0:32:39] ArthurWar: Ooooh, nice
[0:32:41] Burr11: i think they can work if the girl likes the cheesiness, just an icebreaker, but it's so hard to know who can take it as a joke
[0:32:47] JTBun: @tripsout2 ashton51Noted
[0:32:59] Senoquese: pickup lines for some reason seem to work way better if youre already hot and dont make the first interaction awkward
[0:33:00] InsaneLoke: flirting works best after a back and forth
[0:33:06] InsaneLoke: best to approach normally
[0:33:09] demon_dandy: They are both taken ashton51Heyyy
[0:33:10] Romblymo: I tend to enter similarly with like "oh I noticed xyz, it looks good on you"
[0:33:20] GManx0: You need to actually be funny
[0:33:23] astroshenanigans: @Senoquese pretty sure thats true for everything
[0:33:32] redactedenheim: they work beat when you read them directly from the notepad
[0:33:40] Kitkattack: @Romblymo yeah lil compliment is the best start
[0:33:45] tripsout2: OHHH AND the goth complimented my ashton jacket which is how the convo became about you LOL
[0:33:46] Donkler57: Donkler57
[0:33:47] Kitkattack: then just chat about wtv
[0:33:51] sparks0s: "Hey girl let me massage you, must feel heavy carrying all that beautt"
[0:33:54] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[0:34:04] Senoquese: like what matters is being their type and making a good first impression ashton51Tehe not the actual pickup line
[0:34:05] eb0ss1: gigachad
[0:34:05] chinfoil: dayum
[0:34:07] Romblymo: Please write a review on the jacket
[0:34:07] demon_dandy: Yeah and if you know its cheesy, whenever my cousin would do it hed end up laughing and theyd laugh too
[0:34:07] InsaneLoke: LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:34:08] Burr11: lmao
[0:34:08] HuckFinn__: Legendary
[0:34:11] JTBun: @tripsout2 was it the white or black one? lmao

[0:34:28] buruhas: The Ashton merch gets you goth baddies fr fr
[0:34:38] w0wells: "Popular with the gays"
[0:34:48] sparks0s: im too socially awkward ashton51Dance

[0:34:49] rodetovenaar: "Hey girl, wanna experience a blizzard? You can get [remainder of this pickup line redacted]"
[0:34:50] astroshenanigans: Did Heaven lose an angel because you've got nice cans
[0:35:02] pogotross: @astroshenanigans om
[0:35:08] astroshenanigans: 20 years old joke
[0:35:17] outrunthewind: "Now what?" "I dunno, I never expected to get this far"
[0:35:19] Senoquese: pick up lines are just an excuse to make the first interaction, the actual line doesnt matter as long as its not sexual harassment LOL
[0:35:27] chinfoil: "hey girl, have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14"
[0:35:30] astroshenanigans: no Futurama fans here i guess

[0:36:05] tripsout2: ashton51Thinky  ??? if its a club maybe but bars usually just let you walk right in.
[0:36:08] demon_dandy: ashton51Bocchi
[0:36:11] InsaneLoke: ive never encountered a cover more than 10
[0:36:13] Burr11: i mean that makes sense
[0:36:14] sparks0s: "hey girl *gnomes walks past* woah hey did you see that"
[0:36:16] DerSeelander: Girls?
[0:36:17] eb0ss1: i almost paid it because i was drunk asf

[0:37:07] rikkaonline: ashton51Thinky
[0:37:10] Romblymo: Yeah depending on the bar it is wild on new years, it's why the lads usually just go to somebody's place nowadays

[0:37:21] demon_dandy: Vas zat guy bozzering you 🧛‍♂️

[0:37:25] eb0ss1: OMG i want a crow-friend
[0:37:25] Romblymo: I think the closest thing to a pickup like I've used was "hey I'm sorry but you caught my eye and I just spent the last 10 minutes trying to come up with a line, but I didn't want to miss my chance"
[0:37:27] InsaneLoke: you can charm a woman by offering her a cheese

[0:44:43] sparks0s: years
[0:44:45] DavidPortnov: I think it's just another form of expression.
[0:44:47] TheMoatman: The actual bubble already burst
[0:44:47] rodetovenaar: People have been saying that since Myth
[0:44:50] ArthurWar: Like every year since it took off genuinely
[0:44:51] TheMoatman: Like a year or two ago
[0:44:55] Burr11: it felt like a bubble during covid tbh, but it's gotten past that now
[0:44:55] astroshenanigans: AI gonna steal good vtubing jobs
[0:44:58] sparks0s: but there's still the stigma behind it
[0:45:02] eb0ss1: people have short attention spans and are OBSESSED with numbers
[0:45:04] demon_dandy: Yeah during myth is crazy ashton51Tehe
[0:45:05] timinator193: Why would this stop?
[0:45:07] TheMoatman: We're at steady state vtubing now
[0:45:14] HuckFinn__: "Thats a 50 year old guy with a voice changer"
[0:45:17] pogotross: the twitch streaming bubble popped yeah
[0:45:22] redactedenheim: its not growing as fast as it was
[0:45:22] outrunthewind: The main issue is that the number of vtubers is growing faster than the number of vtuber viewers
[0:45:30] tripsout2: ashton51Love im glad youre doing ok tho im gonna go rest off the new years party exhaustion. (the jacket really is sick as hell)
[0:45:30] demon_dandy: Its proven itself to not really be a bubble ig
[0:45:46] Donkler57: I think maybe the corpo bubble burst because a lot more corpo vtubers are going indie nowadays
[0:45:46] Guinea_De_Pig: I got into it cause of watching mouse, then I expanded as time went on
[0:45:49] nomzoogles: the librarian vtuber gateway unironically got me ashton51Heyyy
[0:45:54] demon_dandy: Dokuzuhonsha aaaaahhhh ashton51Uwah
[0:45:54] Romblymo: Man I guess December this year it'll be 10 years of vtubers for me
[0:46:12] TheMoatman: That's when the corps that were created during the proper bubble were collapsing. Small companies (indies) can usually weather bubbles bursting if they don't overleverage.
[0:46:15] sparks0s: Its honestly crazy that i've been a fan of vtubers since i was a teen
[0:46:19] ArchonWulf: comfy slop
[0:46:25] Kitkattack: look up ashton inflation to learn more
[0:46:32] DavidPortnov: I didn't even know about Niji until all of the stuff went down. We all know what that is, I'm not going to rehash it. I may have been a bigger Niji fan than Hololive if the timeline was different.
[0:46:35] astroshenanigans: is this geoguessr going to be street view outside of pit crew houses?
[0:46:37] TheMoatman: To an actual economic bubble yeah
[0:46:48] theSimplechild: What even is a vtuber bubble. Are you taking out a mortgage for your model or something
[0:46:50] rodetovenaar: I bounced off a lot of vtubers from Kizuna AI and Hololive JP, but didn't really get into it until Myth
[0:46:59] Burr11: weak corporations also get picked off
[0:47:02] Senoquese: are you gonna do the 8+ hours tonight haha youll be ending close to my lunch break if you do
[0:47:04] rodetovenaar: Which I can blame on the Azur Lane Kizuna AI collab
[0:47:15] Senoquese: ashton51Omegalul
[0:47:18] timinator193: GOOD
[0:47:21] Romblymo: Every content cycle tends to go indie->corps->indie think of YouTube sectors and, livestreaming sectors
[0:47:22] StreamElements: Welcome to my Winter Break Donothon, pit crew!!! I'm streaming every day until January 4th to raise money for my upcoming projects in 2026. Wanna help me out? Let it snow here: https://streamelements.com/ashtonmarten/tip ❄
[0:47:28] pantalaimon91: I think with the current economic downturn the "bubble" has definitely popped for the vtubing space, but I also don't think it's in any real danger.
[0:47:41] Senoquese: woah 9am
[0:47:49] Senoquese: oh eugh
[0:47:49] astroshenanigans: ...are you going to sleep at all?
[0:47:53] rodetovenaar: The react bubble lol
[0:47:55] rodetovenaar: Man
[0:47:55] Romblymo: Remember Machinima and all the content orgs
[0:47:59] Senoquese: you still mention the react word copyright that was so crazy
[0:48:00] ArthurWar: Oh yeah, like Machinima
[0:48:01] InsaneLoke: multi channel marketing
[0:48:02] DavidPortnov: MCNs?
[0:48:04] Guinea_De_Pig: we bout to copywrite the term vtuber
[0:48:04] Burr11: oh yeah
[0:48:06] rodetovenaar: Yeah, the multi-channel groups
[0:48:06] DavidPortnov: Yeah, ok.
[0:48:09] nomzoogles: content houses..
[0:48:20] DavidPortnov: Sure did.
[0:48:21] outrunthewind: There were a lot of small vtuber corps that didn't have a plan to make money, didn't provide actual support to their vtubers, or were founded by guys that had impure motivations toward their streamers
[0:48:24] astroshenanigans: omg, i forgot about machina
[0:48:26] sparks0s: oh no not content houses
[0:48:37] nomzoogles: oh noo lol
[0:48:39] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:48:40] ArthurWar: LOL
[0:48:41] rodetovenaar: Streamer Houses.....
[0:48:43] Romblymo: Similar thing with livestream teams for a while it was all content houses and eSports teams only
[0:48:44] Senoquese: LOL
[0:48:48] timinator193: Oh pyrocynical?
[0:48:58] Senoquese: normal boots was a MCN right Classic
[0:49:00] InsaneLoke: the fat one
[0:49:04] eb0ss1: anything4views
[0:49:06] pogotross: anything4views?
[0:49:07] sparks0s: seeing stuff from older years nowadays feels so weird yet nostalgic
[0:49:27] InsaneLoke: yeah
[0:49:30] rodetovenaar: Let's not forget about "pranking" youtubers
[0:49:30] DavidPortnov: @Senoquese Sure was.
[0:49:39] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[0:49:43] redactedenheim: a bottle of malort?
[0:49:50] rodetovenaar: 2 bottles of malort?
[0:49:59] horribleham: can never have too much toolbox
[0:50:00] sparks0s: more toolboxes are great
[0:50:01] DavidPortnov: A third bottle of malort?
[0:50:02] demon_dandy: Its insane to think roosterteeth waa trying compete with netflix
[0:50:15] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[0:50:17] rodetovenaar: A what?
[0:50:17] chinfoil: PK sweat
[0:50:21] ArthurWar: Ooooh ashton51Uwah
[0:50:24] TheMoatman: SMH she's been hitting the malort again
[0:50:30] ArchonWulf: does Malort count as attempted manslaughter?
[0:50:35] InsaneLoke: thats right
[0:50:38] rodetovenaar: Yeah, Roosterteeth did that
[0:50:38] eb0ss1: yup
[0:50:38] TheMoatman: Lots of people did in the early 2000s
[0:50:39] DavidPortnov: Yeah.
[0:50:40] ArthurWar: Oh yeah, there was Maker too that got bought by Disney right?
[0:50:40] demon_dandy: They had that website for the whole decade
[0:50:40] GManx0: Rooster Teeth death was inevitable
[0:50:41] showmetuesday: yeah that was roosterteeth
[0:50:43] Romblymo: Oh the pajamas? How are they
[0:50:45] TheMoatman: So did Giantbomb
[0:50:51] InsaneLoke: i used to have a rooster teeth subscription so i could watch rwby
[0:50:57] Kitkattack: Linus tech did that too
[0:50:57] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke YEAHH ashton51Tehe
[0:50:58] rodetovenaar: Funny Or Die too
[0:51:02] eb0ss1: saaame @InsaneLoke
[0:51:06] showmetuesday: to be fair to them tho roosterteeth literally had their website BEFORE youtube
[0:51:10] demon_dandy: @InsaneLoke Their player was soooo ass ICANT
[0:51:19] DavidPortnov: Awesome!
[0:51:24] Red__2: ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap

[0:51:32] astroshenanigans: College Humor is still going strong, kinda
[0:51:38] ArthurWar: Oh wait, no it was Polaris, that was an MCN that existed and got bought out by Disney
[0:51:40] a_raccoon27: the new formula isnt as bad as it used to be
[0:51:42] redactedenheim: malort tastes like urine flavored dirt
[0:51:43] demon_dandy: I was a big rt kid too
[0:51:45] astroshenanigans: Dropout
[0:51:46] DavidPortnov: I've got a drink recipe that's malort-heavy.
[0:51:47] rodetovenaar: College Humor is Dropout now
[0:51:49] Romblymo: I had it for the early podcasts though
[0:51:56] Romblymo: Remember the creatures
[0:52:02] InsaneLoke: i think back then it wasnt so farfetched for them to want to compete with netflix for original series
[0:52:04] astroshenanigans: yep
[0:52:07] TheMoatman: Yeah, Dropout is like entirely ex-collegehumor staff
[0:52:08] astroshenanigans: Dropout.t

[0:52:37] Kitkattack: Malort tastes like the worst bitters you've ever had
[0:52:48] pogotross: they YAPPED?!? how dare.
[0:53:10] DavidPortnov: Malort could not be nearly as bad as spoiled uni.
[0:53:17] hottungsten: one day I'll DIY the onion infused malort and take it to a con
[0:53:18] Burr11: ashton51Despair
[0:53:29] TheMoatman: Someone who's had both Malort and Moxie, are the aftertastes comparable?
[0:53:35] Romblymo: Gus was the grouch of the group yeah
[0:53:37] DavidPortnov: @hottungsten  ashton51Baby
[0:53:44] demon_dandy: Joel was the buy gold guy yeah LOL

[0:53:55] TheMoatman: It's soda with a notoriously bad aftertaste
[0:54:02] pogotross: never take moxie it's a bad recovery skill
[0:54:02] Kitkattack: you're a sicko for that @hottungsten ashton51Omegalul
[0:54:09] Red__2: It reduces endurance on uphill sections for front runners
[0:54:09] Romblymo: @rodetovenaar Do we want that lol
[0:54:17] TheMoatman: Those people are wrong
[0:54:27] astroshenanigans: similar to root beer, right.....

[0:54:51] hottungsten: I can be the supplier
[0:54:52] TheMoatman: Or actually, the aftertaste after you slam a whole bottle of cough syrup
[0:54:54] rodetovenaar: Maybe like *a* bottle or something
[0:54:55] TheMoatman: Oh I was talking about Moxie
[0:54:56] DavidPortnov: Alright, looking forward to the Offkai malort!
[0:54:58] Senoquese: yayyyy
[0:55:03] rodetovenaar: I love the Coke museum
[0:55:08] Kitkattack: Amaretto is like cough syrup
[0:55:13] astroshenanigans: Malort and Moxie would be  a memorable mixed drink
[0:55:16] Romblymo: We don't have it in Canada, I'll get a taste of it at OffKai I guess
[0:55:26] InsaneLoke: speaking of cough syrup, i loooooooove jaeger
[0:55:34] redactedenheim: dr pepper is like being kissed by an angel especially when compared to malort
[0:55:38] Romblymo: My coworkers said I was lame for going to the coke museum when I was in Atlanta
[0:55:41] rodetovenaar: I will find a bottle of Malort in NorCal just for you, Ashton
[0:55:46] TheMoatman: Yeah but there's that one chemical that makes you like shut off your nose and upper palate when you exhale. That's the cough syrup taste I'm talking about
[0:55:47] hottungsten: @Romblymo if I go to oshiuplink i'll run you a whole bottle lmao
[0:55:50] Kitkattack: I'll get some at the duty-free for you @Romblymo you'll regret it I'm sure

[0:56:15] snowypurple512: To me it tastes like wood and deer fur but it tastes great when mixed with ginger ale
[0:56:16] demon_dandy: jaeger bomb does sound cooler than most other drink names
[0:56:17] InsaneLoke: drop a shot of jager in red bull
[0:56:17] Burr11: jaeger in red bull
[0:56:17] Kitkattack: you shouldn't say that
[0:56:18] TheMoatman: It's when you drop a shot of jeager into a glass of beer
[0:56:18] DerSeelander: Jager + Red Bull = Jagerbomb
[0:56:19] redactedenheim: jaeger bomb is jaeger and red bull
[0:56:25] pantalaimon91: redbull and a jager bomb

[0:57:37] AyukiAkiba: i attest
[0:57:38] TheMoatman: Boilermakers are a shot of whiskey chased with a whole pint of beer
[0:57:44] TheMoatman: Or at least a whole beer

[0:58:05] DerSeelander: You like Guinness though right?
[0:58:12] chinfoil: lychee soju and an IPA lmao
[0:58:18] InsaneLoke: i think youd like jaegerbombs
[0:58:18] rodetovenaar: Oh god.... a Gonster sounds awful, that's so much liquid
[0:58:26] DavidPortnov: Recently, yeah, I think.
[0:58:28] Kitkattack: it's like coffee
[0:58:31] redactedenheim: true
[0:58:31] demon_dandy: guinness is yummy
[0:58:35] DerSeelander: Yes, I'm sorry for watching your VODs, I won't do it again
[0:58:40] DavidPortnov: Guinness is a nice entry beer.
[0:58:40] demon_dandy: Its dense though LOL
[0:58:41] InsaneLoke: guinness gives me bad heartburn
[0:58:44] DavidPortnov: Surprisingly.
[0:58:46] redactedenheim: guinness has a bad rep
[0:58:48] Red__2: The creamy taste takes the edge off, same with baileys
[0:58:48] Yergos: guinness was my first regular beer
[0:58:50] TheMoatman: It isn't?
[0:58:55] AyukiAkiba: i'll try guinness next time I'm at a bar...
[0:58:57] TheMoatman: It's low ABV it can't be dense
[0:59:05] ArchonWulf: gotta have Guinness on tap tho
[0:59:07] Kitkattack: to bad a lot of bars don't have Guinness on tap
[0:59:08] redactedenheim: guinness is not dense, its actually very light and it has less calories than corona
[0:59:20] Yergos: I have a hard time drinking guinness now so it reminds me of throwing up when i was younger, that and jaeger lol
[0:59:23] Senoquese: narshty is an awesome really rare ashtism

[0:59:29] Red_Materia: first time ive heard of guinness having a bad rep
[0:59:33] InsaneLoke: this fall i did a guinness tour of local bars, rating each bar by how well they pour the guinness
[0:59:40] redactedenheim: smithx
[0:59:41] DerSeelander: The thing with the Gonster is that you mix Monster Nitro (nitrogen) with Guinness, which also has nitrogen
[0:59:56] Red__2: Low eating and long sessions
[0:59:56] Kitkattack: just pee
[0:59:59] GManx0: You got White Girl Wasted

[1:00:27] Kitkattack: breaking the seal is nothing
[1:00:39] Red_Materia: im going to drink less this year
[1:00:41] Burr11: ICANT
[1:00:43] Kitkattack: bullshit that college kids made up
[1:00:50] Yergos: @DavidPortnov voodoo ranger juice force is so good for making horrible decisions
[1:00:56] TheMoatman: I've drank most of a fifth of 50% whiskey in a single night before and I've never puked from booze so yeah I don't get it either
[1:01:00] AyukiAkiba: i had two shots of tequila last night on an empty stomach too ✊
[1:01:01] Guinea_De_Pig: beer allows me to pace myself more than harder drinks
[1:01:08] InsaneLoke: i believe in the seal. but i will just simply wait in life for the bathroom
[1:01:09] DavidPortnov: @Yergos  ashton51Noted
[1:01:10] Senoquese: yeah youre gonna drink less and still not eat which is the main issue ashton51Tehe
[1:01:18] TheMoatman: (fifth =750ml)
[1:01:19] Kitkattack: yeah exactly what guinea said, pacing yourself with beer
[1:01:22] ArchonWulf: I'm going to try and drink less too... hopefully less stuff happens.
[1:01:23] rodetovenaar: Maybe just eating more would help yeah...

[1:04:29] pantalaimon91: So is it bad I had Kraken before I was 21 then?
[1:04:30] DavidPortnov: That's what my friend did too. I wasn't there, but he had a real bad time barhopping.
[1:04:31] InsaneLoke: girl who drinks maybe once a month:
[1:04:33] Senoquese: where did this all "uncouth bad" stuff come from these past few months
[1:04:38] ArchonWulf: I am at peace with my trash alcohol.
[1:04:45] InsaneLoke: isnt it idol like to drink heavy and often
[1:04:49] Kitkattack: white girl who though that greek life was the only way to drink
[1:04:54] rodetovenaar: The problem is you drink without eating lol
[1:05:03] rikkaonline: imagine women having fun
[1:05:04] astroshenanigans: Truly a rotten girl
[1:05:06] InsaneLoke: #truthnuke

[1:07:31] Kitkattack: "skulling" om
[1:07:44] demon_dandy: Your first drink stream if anything you were saying how much you werent drunk more than anything ICANT
[1:07:47] redactedenheim: good thing they never found out about the fujo
[1:07:51] DerSeelander: Oh damn

[1:08:08] ArthurWar: Oh what the hell
[1:08:10] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:08:15] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[1:08:15] Kitkattack: that's pretty ironic considering, vtuber racing
[1:08:18] TheMoatman: Huhh

[1:08:25] AyukiAkiba: that's horrible
[1:08:27] timinator193: So power hungry dickhead wow
[1:08:31] TheMoatman: The fuck?
[1:08:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Smile
[1:08:40] bonatide: Lamy my goat
[1:08:43] DavidPortnov: He really though Vtuber Racing was a real corpo ashton51Omegalul
[1:08:43] rodetovenaar: That's really kinda wild lol
[1:08:47] astroshenanigans: @rikkaonline lol, the burps made me crack up
[1:08:51] demon_dandy: Yeah this person really didn't seem familiar ashton51Tehe
[1:08:57] Romblymo: Kinda Dodged a bullet though
[1:08:59] pantalaimon91: Not having to work with that person's manager seems like a win ngl
[1:09:07] Burr11: yeah i think it ended up being good lol
[1:09:18] Senoquese: yeah definitely a good outcome
[1:09:26] mareeples: This story gives me secondhand anger every time.
[1:09:29] demon_dandy: ashton51Cringe
[1:09:33] timinator193: Wow
[1:09:35] DerSeelander: "For fun"
[1:09:40] timinator193: That's awful!
[1:09:41] rodetovenaar: "And that person was Gunrun"
[1:09:46] Kitkattack: just one bad actor, sad you got so bogged down about it
[1:09:48] ArchonWulf: what a weird little prude guy
[1:10:23] Romblymo: There were a few that would just ruin Indies because they were shitters
[1:10:29] timinator193: Genuinely awful
[1:10:44] shindigs: panopticon mentioned
[1:10:47] AyukiAkiba: ashton51Nodders
[1:11:01] demon_dandy: Which sounds incredulous cause why that mfer heckling at chat if hes mr bigwig ICANT
[1:11:02] Romblymo: I think 3-4 years ago it was the worse for people like that
[1:11:12] bonatide: Faux pas? It's over for you buddy
[1:11:23] rodetovenaar: Now I kinda want to know who this person is, but, I wouldn't ask
[1:11:31] Senoquese: yeahhhh
[1:11:40] ArthurWar: Yeah, talk about punching down
[1:11:43] rodetovenaar: But I would like to exclude them from anything I'm a part of ever
[1:11:46] Red_Materia: its not worth talking about trash
[1:11:46] TheMoatman: I have a guess but I won't say it
[1:12:02] AyukiAkiba: I'm sorry that happened to you
[1:12:09] redactedenheim: yeah he probably treats everyone that way
[1:12:14] Senoquese: the axe doesnt remember the tree Classic

[1:12:28] pantalaimon91: It was definitely just a Tuesday to him because you're DEFINITELY not the only person he did that to
[1:12:30] demon_dandy: It is kinda a dodged the bullet situation
[1:12:52] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[1:13:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: he did it to himself
[1:13:03] demon_dandy: Heres hoping
[1:13:04] Senoquese: its a good thing hes not involved in any work if his work is hurting other people
[1:13:19] rodetovenaar: It's ok, we can wish bad upon him for you (I'm spiteful)
[1:13:28] bonatide: Hes not a manager anymore 💅
[1:13:51] Senoquese: LOLL
[1:13:52] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:13:58] ArthurWar: ashton51Omegalul
[1:14:00] Red__2: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:14:06] Senoquese: that singing and dancing was so awesome tho
[1:14:11] Kitkattack: dude was just pulling a stunt
[1:14:20] Romblymo: I feel bad hearing from a few Indies hearing a similar story of the power trip managers
[1:14:27] rodetovenaar: Uncouth is also such a wild word to use in the 2020s
[1:15:07] DerSeelander: AH
[1:15:11] redactedenheim: 2030 lets goooooo
[1:15:12] Red__2: its not fair time needs to halt fr
[1:15:13] JTBun: you love using big or odd words
[1:15:13] astroshenanigans: werent we in the second half last year too?
[1:15:14] koumelover: cut my lyfe up into pieces...
[1:15:15] eb0ss1: uncouth is a good tag
[1:15:15] rodetovenaar: Oh another vertebra just crumbled into dust...
[1:15:16] bonatide: 2020s unc now....
[1:15:18] demon_dandy: it is funny at that time everyone (including myself) would wrongly assume vtuberracing was like actually a manager or group behind you ICANT
[1:15:32] Romblymo: I'm down a few streamers because of similar stories
[1:15:43] Kitkattack: I always assumed vtuber racing was you or your sibling
[1:15:48] DerSeelander: Baaaaaaased
[1:15:51] Senoquese: everytime you say youre uncouth it just makes me remember that story and how it unfortunately feels like that moment still affects you to this day ashton51Tehe like please say fuck ashton51Omegalul
[1:15:52] rodetovenaar: You should really use "uncouth" as a stream tag for the lulz
[1:15:54] InsaneLoke: so whens the next streamer in vtuber racing
[1:16:03] bonatide: Is vtuberracing not a manger group wwparaOgey
[1:16:05] Romblymo: Like they quit because people pushed them out essentially
[1:16:07] Red__2: Atleast in this group you'll get 100% of the ettention and funds of the group ashton51Nodders ashton51Nodders ashton51Nodders
[1:16:13] Burr11: yeah i thought vtuberracing was just ashton at first lol
[1:16:20] demon_dandy: beri joining densetsu AND vtuberracing
[1:16:20] rikkaonline: ashton51Stare
[1:16:20] Senoquese: can i join vtuberracing
[1:16:34] Senoquese: like those assistants that have vtuber designs
[1:16:35] astroshenanigans: when a vtuber retires they become a madam, like the geisha of old
[1:16:36] Romblymo: Vtuberracing is a billion dollar organization
[1:16:39] bonatide: Color me surprised
[1:16:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: vtuberracing is 3 chillas in a trenchcoat
[1:16:40] demon_dandy: Classic
[1:16:41] InsaneLoke: LOL
[1:16:42] TheMoatman: Oh yeah whole ass corps have been built around "rich guy who wants a vtuber harem" before. I don't remember which corps that imploded in 2024 had that as an explicit part of the implosion but at least one did
[1:16:44] rikkaonline: any knowers in chat ashton51Modcheck
[1:16:44] redactedenheim: should be two words
[1:16:44] Burr11: ashton51Tehe
[1:16:44] koumelover: lool
[1:16:47] Kitkattack: and the rest is history
[1:16:47] Red__2: Its iconic these days
[1:16:48] bonatide: Chuuba
[1:16:51] rodetovenaar: Vtuberracing is like THE mafia
[1:16:53] bonatide: Or chud
[1:16:53] AyukiAkiba: hahahahaha
[1:16:57] InsaneLoke: the closest thing to a brand sponsor
[1:16:59] demon_dandy: cheese
[1:17:00] eb0ss1: 'chilla'
[1:17:00] PastaThief911: Im glad she put the word vtuber because I would've never known
[1:17:00] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[1:17:08] shindigs: it worked
[1:17:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: im still waiting for the rest of ashtons gen mates. VTUBER RACING WILL BE REAL
[1:17:11] Kitkattack: vtuber racing is actually a big shot NFT grifter
[1:17:14] Burr11: vtuber racing managers need to be stricter with you tbh
[1:17:16] bonatide: I thought you had some sort of org cuz you know everyone
[1:17:22] StreamElements: Welcome to my Winter Break Donothon, pit crew!!! I'm streaming every day until January 4th to raise money for my upcoming projects in 2026. Wanna help me out? Let it snow here: https://streamelements.com/ashtonmarten/tip ❄
[1:17:23] Romblymo: Vtuberracing isn't even another person it's just Ashton on another account
[1:17:28] Senoquese: LOL
[1:17:28] eb0ss1: bang boom body
[1:17:32] Senoquese: all of soreyu's other girls
[1:17:34] pantalaimon91: So wait, you're saying we aren't getting our names on a car as sponsors?
[1:17:38] redactedenheim: sounds real
[1:17:39] rodetovenaar: And then just Maruzensky (Vtuber)
[1:17:40] rikkaonline: ashton is the only one that didnt get the cease and desist
[1:17:41] bonatide: Furrari driver ashton51Uwah ashton51Uwah ashton51Uwah
[1:17:42] jcall__: i like to imagine vtuberracing can have anychilla killed mob hit style if they act out
[1:17:49] demon_dandy: beri joining densetsu and now vtuberracing so she can be in every org
[1:17:49] nomzoogles: The Untold Story of VtuberRacing..
[1:17:54] PastaThief911: Can I be a toyota prius
[1:17:55] Romblymo: Maybe some day
[1:17:58] Red__2: you'd be my favourite but I'd still tune in to minki every now and then ashton51Heyyy
[1:18:00] DavidPortnov: What if that's like an event stream?
[1:18:06] jcall__: maybe some day
[1:18:08] DavidPortnov: The debuts.
[1:18:16] Kitkattack: (and beri!)
[1:18:22] rodetovenaar: Beri for Hololive (as Beri)
[1:18:24] DavidPortnov: And Beri.
[1:18:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Vtuber racing (and beri 🐞 )
[1:18:27] jcall__: ashton51Heyyy ashton51Heyyy
[1:18:28] Romblymo: Vtuberracing (and Beri)
[1:18:38] Red__2: From jobless to holding two pat-time jobs being an idol and working in the pit
[1:18:39] pantalaimon91: Four arms would probably be very warm
[1:18:40] Senoquese: someone could hug you with their arms and legs and itd probably be the same
[1:18:44] TheMoatman: The vtuber corp venn diagram is all centered around Beri
[1:18:50] redactedenheim: the seal is off
[1:18:53] rikkaonline: lol
[1:18:54] demon_dandy: wait she could drive a buggy CAUGHT
[1:18:55] rodetovenaar: No such thing as too much water
[1:18:58] Senoquese: TRUUEE
[1:19:02] DavidPortnov: @demon_dandy That's cooking!
[1:19:06] rodetovenaar: Or a VW Bug hotrodded out
[1:19:10] bonatide: Why aren't you drinking
[1:19:22] rodetovenaar: Oh, I meant Beri...
[1:19:25] redactedenheim: no
[1:19:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yes
[1:19:28] astroshenanigans: nope
[1:19:31] redactedenheim: it does not work
[1:19:32] Red__2: no it just delays it
[1:19:34] Kitkattack: yes, you just continue being drunk
[1:19:34] bonatide: Only one way to find out
[1:19:36] rikkaonline: your body processes ethanol before it processes the secondary chemicals
[1:19:38] DavidPortnov: I've been weirdly sober too despite being around vodka most of the day.
[1:19:43] TheMoatman: Hair of the dog? No. Well it'll make you feel better but it won't fix the problem
[1:19:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it keeps you in the pocket
[1:19:44] rodetovenaar: They're doing stuff on Sunday
[1:19:45] Romblymo: They do have a collab sunday
[1:19:46] demon_dandy: ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi
[1:19:56] redactedenheim: yes it does
[1:19:57] InsaneLoke: yrah
[1:19:58] DerSeelander: Heck yes
[1:19:59] DavidPortnov: They're already starting!
[1:20:00] JTBun: yeahhhh
[1:20:02] bonatide: Not at all
[1:20:06] Kitkattack: depends on how horribly hungover we're talking
[1:20:12] ArthurWar: I hope that continues, they could get a really cool dynamic going
[1:20:15] InsaneLoke: it absolutely is
[1:20:19] pantalaimon91: .... Ghosts are monsters
[1:20:21] TheMoatman: It depends on the actual cause of the hangover. Dehydration hangovers are easy to fix. "Drank too much but was still hydrated" hangovers are nearly impossible to fix
[1:20:23] Red__2: ghosts are monster they scare me
[1:20:29] DavidPortnov: They count.
[1:20:30] rodetovenaar: The Dungeons And Dragons Monster Manual has ghosts, therefore a ghost is a monster. CHECKMATE LIBERALS
[1:20:32] InsaneLoke: if a bee can be a monster
[1:20:34] demon_dandy: the wait mint is, she go beast mode thats for true
[1:20:34] Romblymo: Ghost doesn't fall under monster girl on tag sorting sites
[1:20:37] eb0ss1: japanese begs to differ (obake)
[1:20:37] redactedenheim: are maids monsters though?
[1:20:43] Romblymo: Not that I would know
[1:20:45] bonatide: They were a monster in scooby doo ghoul school
[1:20:45] DavidPortnov: You can rules lawyer that for sure. Ghosts count.
[1:20:46] Yergos: i think it counts but kinda
[1:20:46] InsaneLoke: @Romblymo oh brother
[1:20:49] Red__2: Ask the monsterfuckers they know all the definitions
[1:20:55] Kitkattack: on the websites ashton51Omegalul
[1:21:06] Kitkattack: speaking of tags ashton51Stare
[1:21:07] rodetovenaar: Fey are also listed in the Monster Manual, therefore, also a monster
[1:21:15] InsaneLoke: i get why but they are absolutely monsters
[1:21:25] Burr11: some ghosts are just cute, but others are pretty monstery imo
[1:21:26] DavidPortnov: Supernatural.
[1:21:30] redactedenheim: is the sta puft marshmallow man a monster? YES
[1:21:33] JTBun: i feel like monster fucking and ghost fucking are different but somewhat related
[1:21:33] InsaneLoke: porn tags arent the end all
[1:21:37] rodetovenaar: If it's in the DnD Monster Manual, it's a monster
[1:21:37] Senoquese: googled "halloween monsters" the first result has a ghost, checkmate
[1:21:40] TheMoatman: They're just less opaque normal girls
[1:21:46] Romblymo: Ashton is a monster girl kinda as well
[1:21:49] Kitkattack: we'll find out where monstergirls fall for her
[1:21:51] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese unironically a more valid point
[1:21:51] rikkaonline: theyre all equally fake ashton51Nerd
[1:21:53] Fallen92x: The ghost would like to be taken by a monster so it still counts.
[1:21:57] pantalaimon91: They're all definitely monster in the broader sense regardless
[1:21:59] RealMrMischief: Hello, Ashton! I came to say that you're a cool VTuber before Beastiz kidnap you into an Azeibarjan desert
[1:22:01] Red__2: if mint leaned into the eldritch terror ghosts maybe they'd be convinced
[1:22:18] TheMoatman: Yeah, but mint was literally just a normal girl at one point. Feebee was always a fairy
[1:22:19] Burr11: some fairies are really mean pranksters, that can be monsterish
[1:22:22] Yergos: I feel like part of the appeal of a monster is it needs to be a bit scary

[1:22:27] DerSeelander: Wait Mint is a fairy?
[1:22:29] bonatide: Fairies are monsters, like the duende
[1:22:40] Romblymo: Feebee is like a multi dimensional character sorta
[1:22:41] rodetovenaar: I feel like people stopped considering Mint a monster when she got legs
[1:22:53] rodetovenaar: Bring back the ectoplasm
[1:22:53] Red__2: Please ashton my beastiez kinda jobless
[1:22:54] RealMrMischief: I thought Mint is a ghost, huh
[1:22:57] InsaneLoke: shes a little faebee lady
[1:22:58] snowypurple512: Heya Ashton is there a pit crew uniform or inspiration? Thinking of making a pit crew cosplay and gathering references!
[1:23:02] Romblymo: Like some feebees are fairys
[1:23:03] redactedenheim: true dat
[1:23:05] astroshenanigans: So i heard Mint mention you had an experience with the Avatar ride at Disney, how was it?
[1:23:12] timinator193: Strokin it a lil?
[1:23:13] DavidPortnov: True. Very banger tweets.
[1:23:17] redactedenheim: we have a visor

[1:23:59] Burr11: yeah mechanic outfit has been the goto so far

[1:40:10] TheMoatman: TheMoatman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! People like you are why nobody believes vtubers when they say they don't have any plans for cons. We all know that shit is planned months ahead of time

[1:41:04] Yergos: er, this year i guess...
[1:41:06] Romblymo: As a rave boy I do like AX
[1:41:06] rikkaonline: ax was good but so expensive
[1:41:09] redactedenheim: yeah, I wait until 2 hours after opening until I arrive
[1:41:12] snowypurple512: I wish every good convention wasn't in the west coast (I live in PA and suffer T^T)
[1:41:14] Burr11: how dare there be a bottleneck at the entrance
[1:41:20] Senoquese: i remember us begging like heyy ashyyy do you have any concert planned ashton51Heyyy offkai again? ashton51Heyyy you should tell us ashton51Heyyy constantly and youd always dodge the question and everyone just believed you
[1:41:22] InsaneLoke: the time i spent inside the actual con was miserable 😭😭😭
[1:41:24] redactedenheim: yes, and acen blows
[1:41:29] JTBun: yeah i dont mind the stuff around AX, not a huge fan of the con itself... its just really overstimulating to me lmao so tiring
[1:41:31] Fallen92x: I used to go when it was smaller but now it's just too much
[1:41:36] rodetovenaar: I know I'm old and crochety, I am just.... AX itself is too much for me
[1:41:40] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy
[1:41:47] rikkaonline: so what cons do you like for 2026?
[1:41:58] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO

[1:42:16] Romblymo: I think something people were saying was "man Ashton would let us know, man no concern 😢"
[1:42:17] demon_dandy: ashton51Sus what could this mean
[1:42:20] rodetovenaar: I don't want to talk about how much money I'm dropping on OffKai...

[1:42:41] ReyJaggy: i did both lol

[1:42:52] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[1:42:56] DavidPortnov: I had a friend that went to the Dodgers game.
[1:43:05] TheMoatman: AX only feels like 100k because they *actually* feel like 500k but cons are almost universally incompetent at handling heavy traffic so a mere 5x slowdown is minor
[1:43:11] Romblymo: I had people picking up Hyuni Happi's that weren't going to be at vv because of the game and I was like "dude she's doing a concert"
[1:43:16] redactedenheim: lots of standing in line
[1:43:21] DerSeelander: They do a drone show at the end
[1:43:25] ArthurWar: There was a light show at the end both times I think
[1:43:27] DerSeelander: With music
[1:43:29] Burr11: they do "take me out to the ball game" at the 7th inning stretch
[1:43:33] astroshenanigans: Are there any Vtuber cons in the Northeast?  Seems like all the best stuff is across the country from me
[1:43:33] rodetovenaar: @Romblymo This will never not amuse me
[1:43:36] Guinea_De_Pig: from what i saw there was a lot of mech as well
[1:43:51] Senoquese: completely unrelated but hmm should i use my pto and money on going to CA around late july ashton51Baby like uhh hows the weather ashton51Baby
[1:43:55] rikkaonline: i hope the stl one does well

[1:44:35] hottungsten: the location is so bad
[1:44:40] DavidPortnov: It's a valid argument both ways.
[1:44:44] yojamjam: vtubers are like hamsters

[1:48:22] F1nalStarman: How large was the Virtual Vacation venue?
[1:48:24] rodetovenaar: AXS and TicketMaster are the same company
[1:48:38] Red__2: the chat was so bugged it was a lil sad
[1:48:48] F1nalStarman: Oh no Minto's concert is way smaller than that...
[1:49:07] Senoquese: they were fixing it on the fly it was silly
[1:49:11] redactedenheim: 200?
[1:49:14] Senoquese: like refreshing to see the new changes
[1:49:15] Romblymo: Sports stuff doesn't have as much chatter apparently
[1:49:18] DavidPortnov: I will be trying tomorrow.
[1:49:19] dax812: My favorite part was how the auditorium was a bowl so all the spilled drinks pooled into my bag at the front ashton51Nodders
[1:49:24] TheMoatman: @astroshenanigans Yeah... don't. I won't go into detail about it because the other people were quite drunk and I don't feel like asking which parts I can or can't say, but it sounded... poorly organized, to say the least.
[1:49:26] rodetovenaar: It's gonna be a bloodbath tomorrow, but I wanna go so bad.... I love jazz
[1:49:38] DavidPortnov: @rodetovenaar Same. I hope we both get one.
[1:49:42] snowypurple512: in hindsight kinda wish I went to your M&G, didn't know they were free nor that I would later enjoy watching funny rodent girl
[1:49:45] Romblymo: @rodetovenaar Good luck brother
[1:49:53] buruhas: the chat in the site was so funny, plus john oshispark mentioning saba multiple times before the show started
[1:50:02] Senoquese: it was very very silly they initially made the emoji reactions fill up the stream like in 5 minutes they regretted it and moved it to the chat box
[1:50:04] DavidPortnov: Oh! When Minto was in Japan last.
[1:50:11] eb0ss1: we're back with the dles
[1:50:15] rikkaonline: lol
[1:50:19] Senoquese: yes
[1:50:24] Senoquese: they were constantly talking about saba and making saba jokes
[1:50:25] DavidPortnov: Yes.
[1:50:29] DavidPortnov: Jokes.
[1:50:29] rodetovenaar: @Romblymo Let's get each other tickets *smile*

[1:51:53] JTBun: I thought about going to the minto jazz concert because it seems like a really fun concept, but Im not the biggest minto fan so Ill let other bigger fans brawl it out
[1:51:55] outrunthewind: rosuuGasp
[1:51:56] Senoquese: i thought maybe it was live but then they played it multiple times by accident ashton51Tehe

[1:53:28] Yergos: watching you in VV was definitely an "I get it" moment for me
[1:53:31] astroshenanigans: released in 1982, i thought you were 21?1?
[1:53:32] Senoquese: omg yeah we were saying that a bunch in chat
[1:53:38] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy ashton51Heyyy
[1:53:38] Senoquese: like people were using the wrong heart emojis
[1:53:48] Senoquese: 💚 instead of 💜
[1:53:49] Romblymo: Like preopeneing people were saying oh she must be green the eyes and the hair
[1:53:50] demon_dandy: @senoquese LOL yeah the color mistakes
[1:53:58] rodetovenaar: Ashton is just really green coded
[1:54:01] eb0ss1: its p quiet
[1:54:03] TheMoatman: Yeah, she's 21. In 1982.,
[1:54:21] TheMoatman: Because your hair is green
[1:54:27] rikkaonline: ashton51Nodders
[1:54:27] Romblymo: I think Mori Castelia has the same thing
[1:54:28] dax812: Soreyu doesn't help the green allegations
[1:54:29] DavidPortnov: Yeah.
[1:54:30] KayAlamode: 2026 Ashton!!
[1:54:35] Burr11: ashton51Tehe
[1:54:35] EbiBoon: Other blonde vtubers? You're not blonde Ashton ashton51Stare
[1:54:36] InsaneLoke: its very ummmmm high vis
[1:54:39] TheMoatman: You literally have zero yellow on your outfit
[1:54:45] DavidPortnov: ashton51Noted
[1:54:50] eb0ss1: mori, Irys, ina have problems with pink/red/purple/violet
[1:54:53] pantalaimon91: I always assumed pink
[1:54:56] demon_dandy: everyone was like uh nimi is green.. dooby is.. blue? Hyuni pink.. OH ashton is YELLOW
[1:55:13] DavidPortnov: @demon_dandy I've always thought yellow for Dooby.
[1:55:14] Senoquese: i mean tbf if i first found you rn you dont have any purple showing and barely any pink ashton51Omegalul
[1:55:29] KayAlamode: I think its cus your mascot chillas are your hair color
[1:55:30] dax812: Just heavenly father
[1:55:41] DavidPortnov: It's the vibe for me, the primary color by the feel.
[1:55:46] Senoquese: yeahhh
[1:55:48] astroshenanigans: white should be the color
[1:55:49] Burr11: people thought Mio's color was red one year which makes sense for the streak of red in her hair, but it's actually green
[1:55:55] InsaneLoke: the yellow of the vv penlights is very close to your hair color tbf
[1:55:57] DavidPortnov: Ashton does feel kind of green-coded by vibe.
[1:55:59] Romblymo: You just exude green idol apparently
[1:56:06] redactedenheim: black is a lightstick color?
[1:56:08] Senoquese: LOL
[1:56:13] TheMoatman: @eb0ss1 Yeah but their issue is people using the wrong pink because p[enlights don't have that many colors. Ashton is like if Ina had people using yellow penlights, or Calli had people using... IDK black or something. Figure out how that works.
[1:56:14] Burr11: no her penlight color is green
[1:56:17] dax812: Colorblind pitcrew be like Ashton is my favorite grey vtuber
[1:56:23] outrunthewind: Ookami Mio's penlight color is green
[1:56:27] DavidPortnov: ashton51Omegalul

[1:57:01] DavidPortnov: To be fair, I don't know idol ball.
[1:57:05] timinator193: No offense but, you are green
[1:57:08] TheMoatman: ??? They're giving colors based on their literal actual character colors
[1:57:10] Burr11: Mio's penlight color is green because her fans are the MioFa forest
[1:57:10] Senoquese: your geen clip is blowing up rn too
[1:57:11] redactedenheim: is it like green m&ms?
[1:57:16] KayAlamode: yeah but are her mascots mostly her hair color?

[1:57:36] Romblymo: But you are caring which is green
[1:57:44] InsaneLoke: your accent is bright highlighter yellow
[1:57:49] eb0ss1: accents? so ash's penlight color is,,, german/midwestern?

[1:58:13] Romblymo: Saying that like yesterdays stream didn't happen
[1:58:21] redactedenheim: but your hair is green?
[1:58:22] InsaneLoke: IT TAKES UP 7% OF YOUR COLORS
[1:58:27] KayAlamode: Ashton, what is the dominant color of the pit crew chilla
[1:58:32] Senoquese: its most of what we see rn tbf
[1:58:36] ThothFrogg: Shes a red vtuber guys
[1:58:41] GManx0: Why we talking about her green hair
[1:58:41] DavidPortnov: The pop of color is kind of bluish green then.
[1:58:42] TheMoatman: Yeah, and the green is the pop of color in the sea of pink
[1:58:43] Red__2: Pitcrew colour theoy lecture when

[1:59:11] InsaneLoke: color theory does not care for your idol standards
[1:59:11] jcall__: its blue
[1:59:12] TheMoatman: Am I wrong
[1:59:18] DavidPortnov: @ThothFrogg Whoa there.
[1:59:20] pantalaimon91: No, we'd never rage bait our oshi. Never

[1:59:43] DavidPortnov: Maybe?
[1:59:44] DerSeelander: Yeah I concur with Bob Marley
[1:59:46] EbiBoon: Ashton you're looking pretty red with anger ashton51Stare
[1:59:55] demon_dandy: I say yellow idol not by color theory but vibe
[2:00:00] eb0ss1: well he inspired sublime and that awas like 1991
[2:00:00] Senoquese: fuck, blaise is right your ticket really is straight up green
[2:00:08] Guinea_De_Pig: I will say, the pitcrew being primarily green does throw one off

[4:35:59] DavidPortnov: I only know this OP from covers/lives.
[4:36:24] nomzoogles: ashton51Omegalul
[4:36:34] DavidPortnov: Between anime and Wii, I'd choose anime too.

[17:09:33] audi0c0aster1: ahhhh that makes the list make a lot more sense
[17:09:34] Romblymo: Since it's like the de facto fast food
[17:09:35] corpswag: Why is In n out in DS?
[17:09:36] maverickdrifter: little ceasars in B at least. Quality sure but 10 dollar hot and ready is a 10 dollar hot and ready
[17:09:40] naniwazuni: im here to vouch for white castle and lil caesars
[17:09:41] DavidPortnov: Five Guys cajun fries though.

[17:10:19] audi0c0aster1: in-n-out fries suck vs. the competition for sure
[17:10:20] eb0ss1: I think i like my in n out fries
[17:10:21] phatscout: Ash the Five Guys fries go hard enough for them to be in B-Tier IMO
[17:10:29] GolfTermBirdie: no subway sucks
[17:10:30] Senoquese: in n out was the first real meal i had in america and jtb was hyping it up SO MUCH like it was the best food ever, and it was like. yeah i guess thats a burger
[17:10:31] F1nalStarman: Ranking In N Out solely on fries would land them in D tier, but nobody goes there for the fries. I always order a burger and a shake.
[17:10:31] phatscout: Even if you don't care about burgers
[17:10:32] yojamjam: ever ordered animal style fries? they're decent as a ev
[17:10:34] hooplahound: subway can go anywhere

[17:10:57] phatscout: Subway is fuck awful but around here we have Dibellas and PrimoHoagies and both go hard
[17:10:57] eatsaduckimust: I guess if you dont eat burgers then burger places would be low rated
[17:10:58] stellareveriey: I like animal style fries
[17:11:08] hooplahound: what about cava
[17:11:09] maverickdrifter: I feel like any fast food burgers I want are from regional chains like Culver's or Dick's in Washington state
[17:11:11] corpswag: animal style fries also kinda are bad, you shouldn't need a pound of other stuff to make fries taste good
[17:11:12] GolfTermBirdie: for your consideration, why go to panda express when better chinese food is available in most of the country?
[17:11:14] ahzree: but... I like the raspberry cheesecake cookies from subway ashton51Despair
[17:11:16] DavidPortnov: See I've never had Jimmy Johns. Subway is my childhood equivalent to most people's McDonalds.
[17:11:27] F1nalStarman: I've always been a Chipotle hater. It's mid and expensive.
[17:11:34] rikkaonline: pei wei is better panda express
[17:11:38] outrunthewind: In-N-Out fries are made from fresh potatoes, and there are a whole bunch of extra prep steps that frozen fries at other places go through to make them crispy and good
[17:11:38] eb0ss1: @F1nalStarman thank you!!!!
[17:11:48] hooplahound: girl whaaaat

[17:11:56] DavidPortnov: @F1nalStarman But it is a lot of slop fast and doesn't make my stomach feel bad later.
[17:11:58] yojamjam: gotta see ashton vs whataburger some day

[17:12:43] GolfTermBirdie: no defending in n out fries
[17:12:43] corpswag: There isn't any salt on those fries which just immediately makes them bad

[17:12:49] GolfTermBirdie: its just potato
[17:12:50] RobotFaker: oh ergh

[17:13:42] GolfTermBirdie: bro it dont count
[17:13:43] outrunthewind: They literally chop the potatoes in the kitchen right next to the window, and they pretty much just fry them straight, and that doesn't make a good fry
[17:13:43] TheMoatman: What about Hardees?
[17:13:43] eb0ss1: LMAOOOOOOO
[17:13:49] rikkaonline: its a burger place

[17:14:06] rikkaonline: hardees used to do other food before they merged
[17:14:07] timinator193: Why rate them at all if you haven't had them?
[17:14:12] phatscout: All I know about Carl's Jr is just the Carls Jr van you can drive in Burnout Revenge

[23:49:00] redactedenheim: kids had it so easy in the 90s
[23:49:09] eb0ss1: they each had a paper copy of the script and read along

[23:51:06] spikebomb5: i gotta watch Ideon. im watchin Fang of the Sun Dougram rn
[23:51:08] DavidPortnov: @DerSeelander Agreed.
[23:51:24] Burr11: yeah besides the tachikomas it doesnt have much else mecha goin on
[23:51:42] phatscout: To be completely honest, I feel like vtubers kinda killed SOL as a genre because vtubers are basically "what if a slice of life anime was real and you could talk to the anime girls"
[23:52:03] DerSeelander: So true
[23:52:04] Burr11: nah vtubers are too messed up and weird to be chill slice of life
[23:52:05] phatscout: like SOL stuff generally feels less popular than in used to be
[23:52:05] DavidPortnov: That's the same story as one of my friends who got into vtubers before I did.
[23:52:13] redactedenheim: wait, you can talk to vtubers?
[23:52:15] demon_dandy: Ig but being able to talk about sol with the vtuber is also fire
[23:52:18] phatscout: (at least on American circles)

[23:52:35] Romblymo: kinda to the degree that video games killed action cartoons
[23:52:52] DavidPortnov: @Romblymo Good point!
[23:53:03] timinator193: You can't say these 3×3's arent deep anymore, you are uncovering pitcrew's life story by them
[23:53:07] phatscout: @romblymo I feel like that's more of a marketing thing more than anything tho it didn't help
[23:53:10] andysnyc: ngl I found VTUBERs when Anime News Network talked about the HoloMyth debuts
[23:53:11] demon_dandy: But was that video games or the industry
[23:53:17] Qrockpot: we are in the era of AI fansubs....
[23:53:21] bonatide: Hello ashquan
[23:53:29] redactedenheim: yeah I found out about vtubers from Trash Taste

[23:53:51] Qrockpot: GG LMAOOOO
[23:53:52] eb0ss1: still havent watched dead dead demons dededededestruction due to shit subs
[23:53:57] demon_dandy: LOL
[23:53:58] Romblymo: @phatscout I recall some marketing reports, but as younger generations got into multiplayer gaming cartoon airtime steadily decreased in the 2015-2020s
[23:54:00] andysnyc: I remember when people would upload fan YT subs of anime shows
[23:54:03] phatscout: I feel like cgdct shows need some more high concept to take off nowadays, ex. Something like bocchi the rock
[23:54:11] DerSeelander: I disliked Vtubers as e-girls but then I saw the Hololive JP minecraft clips pre-Myth
[23:54:12] outrunthewind: I found vtubers from hanging out in fansubbing discords...
[23:54:17] Romblymo: @Romblymo *watchtime
[23:54:24] Senoquese: 2 hours
[23:54:27] demon_dandy: Maybe 2 ish
[23:54:59] phatscout: ex. Bocchi the Rock being more of a character based comedy with weird ass animation at points than just a slice of life show helped in stand out than a straight cgdct in a post vtuber world
[23:55:15] outrunthewind: And then some of the fansubbers from those groups got hired by Hololive
[23:55:29] DerSeelander: Hey I paid for mine too
[23:55:52] DerSeelander: Ah sorry lmao
[23:56:02] RobotFaker: I dunno if I'm gonna be able to stay awake for mine but it's been super interesting seeing everyone's 3x3!!

[23:56:58] alchemistgira: is it disappearance or the show of Haruhi
[23:56:59] phatscout: Watanare
[23:57:01] DerSeelander: Ooooh
[23:57:11] Romblymo: oh the show about a Dandy in Space

[24:43:36] bonatide: Maid dragon deserves more flak
[24:43:37] ThrowRacket: I didnt like it either
[24:43:44] mareeples: I ended up reading the MTL of Bookworm on syosetu so that's how it earned it's place.
[24:43:56] redactedenheim: I dropped bookworm, it was too one dimensional for me
[24:44:03] Burr11: i just thought it was boring i dunno ashton51Tehe  she's so singularly obsessed with books it's a drag
[24:44:16] alchemistgira: or the anime wasnt far enough so they continued the LN
[24:44:16] mareeples: I liked the anime enough to go read the source
[24:44:33] mage_mw: bookworm is like dr stone but they dont aura farm
[24:44:35] Potatoidea: Bookworm was fun
[24:44:50] mage_mw: people love umami
[24:44:55] iamj16: no

[24:45:01] alchemistgira: i havnt seen the restaurant isekai i need to add it

[24:45:49] mage_mw: yeah theres isekai izakaya as well
[24:45:50] iamj16: yeah
[24:45:54] mage_mw: they are shared universes
[24:46:03] alchemistgira: oh

[24:46:41] redactedenheim: I don't mind a good food porn anime but I got burned out on them
[24:46:44] Qrockpot: the one on the list is the superior of the two imo
[24:46:58] iamj16: Izakaya isekai one is kinda boring tbh
[24:47:14] Qrockpot: its because its just in that one town
[24:47:21] Velignis: my favorite isekai was log horizon, but then it started to taper off the politics and into reality outsider stuff

[24:47:29] Qrockpot: this one at least has travelers/customers from all over
[24:47:44] mage_mw: i prefer isekai izakaya mainly because it follows a consistent theme around the lifespan of a family owned business
[24:47:47] alchemistgira: oh is it a episodic series?
[24:48:21] Reflow_max: I don't have a 3x3 no
[24:48:25] iamj16: resturant to another world is what you see is waht you get
[24:48:26] Reflow_max: Just sayin hi
[24:48:44] Velignis: @Blaisevtch i get it was gonna go into the direction of "why and how are we here" but i think it went too far into it
[24:48:55] mareeples: Those we difficult for me
[24:48:56] Qrockpot: @blaisevtch I know the children arc had to get adapted, but it killed the show LMAO
[24:49:02] demon_dandy: Apothecary is very worth a spot
[24:49:11] mareeples: Having 2 shows from the same year was so difficult to justify even though I did
[24:49:20] Qrockpot: give me politics and nerds doing high level raids

[24:50:06] alchemistgira: i am aoi yuuki biased so apothecary has my side

[24:50:22] demon_dandy: LOL
[24:50:27] andysnyc: plus some 9/10 shows could be a 2 for some people.
[24:50:33] Potatoidea: People that say the worst show they watched is a popular shonen
[24:51:05] andysnyc: What do you think of Rentarou and the 1000 girlfriends?
[24:51:08] yojamjam: death note is on my grid and i do not apologize it's little caesars
[24:51:13] iamj16: I enjoy my isekai slop, but I will give credit to frieren and apoth. diary for being real good shows

[25:39:40] Qrockpot: LOL
[25:39:48] redactedenheim: silently?
[25:40:04] Velignis: in bofuri, the MC is the stress tester for the game, overpowered but still challenged and forced to think creatively, its what made the show enjoyable
[25:40:21] mage_mw: @Velignis you know her ass is not thinking
[25:40:29] alchemistgira: @phatscout i mean mostly in that like code geass it had ads but they did nothing for the series it was just there
