[1:11:25] Senoquese: is it?????? its just twitter but with communities
[1:11:41] kyle__senpai: It's like those old forums
[1:11:47] rikkaonline: rss feeds are awesome
[1:11:48] demon_dandy: tbh i hate lookin at reddit pages too
[1:11:49] kyle__senpai: Really Simple Syndication
[1:11:50] DatBoiVLC: fed or forum?
[1:11:50] Navy_Mongoose: It's just like the League Of Legends forums
[1:12:03] Burr11: RSS feeds is very old internet thing to distribute content without actually going to the website
[1:12:07] rikkaonline: its a list of page updates, so you can have software keep track of when pages update
[1:12:08] T33bags: reddit super simple

[1:12:28] persibutts: It's like proto-push notifications
[1:12:30] Senoquese: like how the discord bot read your twitter
[1:12:31] Burr11: with an RSS reader
[1:12:35] Navy_Mongoose: Yes and lolno and Mario Kart isn't installed/owned
[1:12:37] rikkaonline: you have a piece of software that reeds the rss feed periodically
[1:12:39] w_khan3_0: after i learned to program i checked how the popular sites were structured. Reddit is hell, its a miracle it still works
[1:12:51] JTBun: yes
[1:12:54] rikkaonline: yeah
[1:12:55] kyle__senpai: Yes
[1:12:58] Burr11: or you can publish the RSS feed on your own website
[1:13:07] rikkaonline: its like creating a news website, for the content you want
[1:13:09] rikkaonline: no
[1:13:12] rikkaonline: theyre perfect
[1:13:17] kyle__senpai: I was addicted when I was in middle school. RSS is a hell of a drug
[1:13:20] rikkaonline: the point is they arent centralized
[1:13:37] rikkaonline: no
[1:13:40] Senoquese: the website has to make them themselves for the most part, theres external services but it really depends, twitter had it and thats how i got your discord bot but they removed every way
[1:13:46] T33bags: addicted to rss like tiktok
[1:13:55] rikkaonline: your app reads from the websites you want. theres no like google or apple in the middle
[1:13:57] kyle__senpai: RSS is not supported too much. Google killed their Google Reader and RSS kind of failed soon after
[1:13:58] Senoquese: but its just a way of taking the content in the website and saying "heres the title, heres the image, theres the body"
[1:14:06] JTBun: lmaooo
[1:14:09] Senoquese: in a way that every reader can understand
[1:14:13] demon_dandy: theyre throwing you off course ashton51Nightmare

[1:14:42] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:14:44] Burr11: yeah people are obnoxiously judgmental about code.. even if they're right... but a lot of times it really is just different ways to skin a cat
[1:14:46] Senoquese: i do not give a fuck about coding discussion, your bots have all been a mess and i do not care LMAOO
[1:14:46] rikkaonline: the way the Correct way to code keeps changing is why it isnt real engineering imo
[1:15:07] JTBun: i mean if it works and no one else works on the code, who the fuck cares sdjkhgsdjkhgjdksg
[1:15:09] Burr11: lmao
[1:15:11] kyle__senpai: It depends on the project. There are a lot of paradigms for coding and some tools are good for some projects
[1:15:23] fixedspectacles2014: I write all my code on one line soulycFUFU
[1:15:27] Senoquese: if anyone touched your obs bot or your twitter bot theyd wanna die over how shitty my code is according to those discussions
[1:15:31] Burr11: and yeah if nobody else is working on your code dont care about the "quality" unless it really makes it hard for you to maintain
[1:15:38] rikkaonline: sure

[1:15:54] demon_dandy: Nice buns ashton51Baby
[1:16:03] Senoquese: you theoretically can do anything really, theres a code language that relies on emojis

[1:16:44] T33bags: i learned to code a little for my thesis but only in a language so specialized for a stats program
[1:16:45] Senoquese: i dont think she means making the smallest code possible, she means taking a whole program and putting it in one line
[1:16:51] w_khan3_0: normally you need to code in a way your coworkers of future replacements can understand it. lots of people dont do that and is sucks later
[1:16:56] rikkaonline: makes my job feel more secure

[2:05:30] Navy_Mongoose: Either 1, 3, New Vegas, or 4
[2:05:31] JTBun: yeah New Cegas all the way
[2:05:31] anonsama9001: fallout 2
[2:05:33] a_shybot: yeah nv is the best story
[2:05:35] fookengrooven: fallout 4 is most famous so
[2:05:37] rikkaonline: lol not 1 or 2
[2:05:40] a_shybot: imo at least :)
[2:05:40] Senoquese: any fallout game is really long tho so idk if youd just wanna do a one off stream
[2:05:41] TheAsterite: 1 and 2 are very retro
[2:05:43] anonsama9001: 1 or 2
[2:05:43] TheAsterite: and very janky
[2:05:47] ScarletRook: ye always hear good things about nv
[2:05:50] Bookethead: fallout 4 is worse than new vegas, but better than 76
[2:05:53] JTBun: FO1 is a top down strategy game
[2:05:54] rikkaonline: 1 and 2 is different game type
[2:05:55] fookengrooven: fallout 1 would be cool so u can watch the series after on prime video :)
[2:05:56] Burr11: fallout 1 and 2 are 2D top down
[2:05:57] demon_dandy: 3 and above are fps
[2:06:00] Navy_Mongoose: because 2 builds on stuff from 1
[2:06:00] T33bags: fallout 4 is actually ok but new vegas' story is really captivating
[2:06:01] Burr11: you might rage at them
[2:06:02] JTBun: NV is the best one
[2:06:05] Senoquese: @T33bags this
[2:06:06] TheAsterite: bad things about new vegas?
[2:06:07] anonsama9001: 3 onwards are basically modern games
[2:06:08] Senoquese: YES
[2:06:09] TheAsterite: blasphemy
[2:06:11] Senoquese: any fallout game is really long
[2:06:14] DatBoiVLC: maybe
[2:06:17] COLORGEIST: i loved new vegas and believe it or not i liked 76
[2:06:18] Bookethead: it depends on how deep you go into sidequests and such
[2:06:24] Burr11: yes it could take a year.. you can pour in hundreds of hours if you want
[2:06:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They are SO FUCKING BUGGY so itll take a while to go through them
[2:06:28] Navy_Mongoose: Bethesda is 3 onward
[2:06:32] rikkaonline: lol theyre quite a company
[2:06:35] Senoquese: your pace is really slow so yeah youd take a year
[2:06:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: also Modded fallout and stock fallout are NOT the same
[2:06:41] JTBun: yes it is, but New Vegas was made by Obsidian, a different studio
[2:06:41] rikkaonline: they have a specific game styke
[2:06:45] Burr11: i heard fallout 76 is better now than when it launched..
[2:06:49] Senoquese: LOL
[2:06:50] the_ol_regular: Not the bathroom
[2:06:52] Navy_Mongoose: *except New Vegas, which was Obsidian
[2:06:54] a_shybot: i mean you can rush the story if you want :)
[2:07:03] Bookethead: new vegas is more in line with the old pre-bethesda fallout games
[2:07:13] the_ol_regular: Also is chat really talking about Bethesda again?
[2:07:16] JTBun: the best Fallout game wasn't made by Bethesda funilly enough
[2:07:19] demon_dandy: new vegas is really good stand alone ashton51Tehe
[2:07:23] T33bags: another study worked heavily on new vegas so they dont rely on a lot of bethesda story elements
[2:07:26] Navy_Mongoose: My main gripe with New Vegas is that it isn't turn-based ashton51Angy
[2:07:26] chinwillach: New Vegas is considered the best cuz it was made by a competent game studio
[2:07:30] T33bags: really is its own story
[2:07:50] Burr11: i dont hate the bethesda fallouts they're okay...
[2:07:51] JTBun: yes it was made by obsidan
[2:07:54] JTBun: don't play skyrim
[2:07:58] demon_dandy: people dog on bethesda for fair reason
[2:08:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Skyrim is gonna take you 3 years to finish
[2:08:04] rikkaonline: new vegas was made by a diffeernt company using bethesdas engine
[2:08:05] COLORGEIST: play skyrim!!!
[2:08:05] the_ol_regular: At what point did the internet go from "we love bethesda" to "Bethesda was never good"?
[2:08:10] Navy_Mongoose: New Vegas was made by Obsidian using Bethesda's engine and assets
[2:08:25] Burr11: @the_ol_regular when they ported skyrim to 10 different platforms instead of doing something new
[2:08:33] the_ol_regular: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:08:36] chinwillach: Yea Bethesda merely published New Vegas like how they published Doom
[2:08:36] JTBun: @the_ol_regular when people realized they just made the same shit over and over again and it got boring and lame
[2:08:42] demon_dandy: they were always kinda dog water if you werent on reddit
[2:08:47] the_ol_regular: @jtbun oh hey Atlu-
[2:08:47] Senoquese: if youre gonna paly one bethesda game, it should be skyrim imo
[2:08:49] T33bags: it was published by bethesda and they aided in the development but by far it was mostly done by obsidian which shows in its differences to other bethesda games in gameplay and story
[2:08:57] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, basically when people started calling Fallout 3 "Oblivion with guns"
[2:08:59] the_ol_regular: I'm kidding chat don't kill me
[2:09:10] demon_dandy: LMAO
