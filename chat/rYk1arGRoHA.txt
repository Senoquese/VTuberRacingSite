[0:56:27] funnyplanet1: both ^^
[0:56:29] redactedenheim: I can look at feet whenever I want, I have two and the cats each have 4. So do it when you feel like doing it.
[0:56:32] Senoquese: how come you have two separate images instead of crossing the $ and the goal separately
[0:56:42] DerSeelander: Not a foot guy, but why not both?
[0:56:44] demon_dandy: I think you should separate the ringfit stream tbh
[0:56:45] DavidPortnov: Foot people sound off!
[0:56:50] Kitkattack: I don't give a gaf but prob neat and like sheer socks
[0:56:53] AyukiAkiba: I guess a prettier foot of yours will live on the internet forever if you pedicure
[0:56:55] DerSeelander: Au naturale and pedicured
[0:57:02] pogotross: I think the foot guys want the pedicure so you'll talk about it happening on stream
[0:57:06] redactedenheim: ok, add a 20,000 goal for feet phase 2

[1:04:50] justchiken: ashton51Sus
[1:04:51] Senoquese: you do always talk about them in your collabs ashton51ICANT
[1:04:52] Donkler57: Wait people are actually into feet...
[1:04:52] timinator193: Why specifically your feet?
[1:04:55] demon_dandy: @Senoquese losing rank..
[1:04:56] spikebomb5: so u know how models have modeling poses, like how they hold their body and limbs, like that
[1:04:59] Romblymo: she's so foot confident
[1:05:03] pogotross: @Donkler57 yes.
[1:05:10] timinator193: yes good
[1:05:12] timinator193: ashton51Love
[1:05:15] outrunthewind: I imagine a scenario where you contact a professional photographer to take pictures of your feet, and they're just like, "Ugh, not another one"
[1:05:25] Kitkattack: guys bring out the "it's over, we're so back" infographic ashton51Omegalul
[1:05:34] The_Great_Moof: @outrunthewind LMAO
[1:05:36] timinator193: ?
[1:05:43] HuckFinn__: Nooo
[1:06:21] timinator193: You sound cute? idk
[1:06:24] Senoquese: not really
[1:06:28] rikkaonline: you have a normal female voice
[1:06:31] demon_dandy: I think the collab one is you talk different to chat vs when theres a target
[1:06:38] vermillion2002: you got a good voice
[1:06:41] timinator193: @rikkaonline fr
[1:06:44] Senoquese: most of these cases, myself included, are people just noticing you have a like 2% different pitch for a minute
[1:06:47] justchiken: I don't think it's a big deal yuriaShrug
[1:06:49] Romblymo: not being right next to the mic sorta makes sense you sound different, that is something we have to account for during set recordings. I think you sound pretty consistent
[1:06:58] timinator193: Its not serious, at all
[1:07:05] Kitkattack: your voice?
[1:07:07] rikkaonline: you are obsessing over nothing imo, people are just commenting on minor variations between recordings of the same person
[1:07:10] funnyplanet1: i never noticed ^^
[1:07:11] Senoquese: @rikkaonline this
[1:07:16] mareeples: The only thing I hope is that you're not forcing your voice. Any voice that's comfortable for you is good for us.
[1:07:19] DavidPortnov: @rikkaonline This.
[1:07:20] timinator193: yes
[1:07:25] Senoquese: like i say sounding "different" but different is a very very strong word
[1:07:33] DavidPortnov: Honestly, it really doesn't matter/.
[1:07:36] outrunthewind: You're overthinking this
[1:07:51] rikkaonline: your existence to us is through a microphone, so we dont have a real world "normal" to compare to, and maybe some people cant compute that
[1:07:58] Romblymo: and if this is like a "streamer voice" that is fine since this is your speaking voice vs like casual voice. How you speak to people sounds different depending on what a person is doing
[1:08:03] Senoquese: @rikkaonline agree
[1:08:08] timinator193: I mean your "Uguu" voice is your actual voice right? ashton51Heh
[1:08:10] Kitkattack: your voice is your brand to a degree but it's way to meta to think you can game the system with it somehow
[1:08:11] Senoquese: you didnt sound any different at all when talking to sister marten imo
[1:08:14] DavidPortnov: @rikkaonline It's this exactly.
[1:08:21] SaintanickClause: that's natural to happen when ya don't know how you might sound to everyone else at any given time HypeMyHeart
[1:08:23] ReyJaggy: i dont like when someone makes a voice and its really noticeable. But for you, i like your voice cause it just sounds like ashton not a vtuber making cutesie voice
[1:08:42] DavidPortnov: @ReyJaggy Same. It's totally fine.
[1:08:44] Senoquese: literally the only real cases of you sounding different were during your debut and during uguu voice yeah

[1:08:53] PSYCOMMUnist: Why worry about your voice so much when everyone loves it?
[1:08:58] ahzree: yes
[1:08:58] Senoquese: yes
[1:08:59] Romblymo: You don't have much variation, if anything your mic is just good at making it sound like not a mic when your up close
[1:09:01] DavidPortnov: Yes.
[1:09:03] ahzree: :<
[1:09:03] spikebomb5: ashton sounds cute and geeky. ur mom sounds like a mom. ur sis sounds like a skater girl tomboy type
[1:09:05] Bambis_Mother: I know rationally that Ashton is really a 55 year old man with a voice changer, but I still like to believe anime girls are real
[1:09:09] redactedenheim: are cheek puffs an Utz product?

[1:09:58] DavidPortnov: @spikebomb5 I hear pretty much same.
[1:10:13] Romblymo: only having 3 bars seems strange to me, like your not band switching or something
[1:10:20] DavidPortnov: @redactedenheim These cheese puffs, yeah.
[1:10:27] Senoquese: " Resetting network settings always fixes that issue for me. Settings>General>Reset iPhone>Reset>Reset Network Settings"
[1:10:27] PSYCOMMUnist: Maybe get a better router that can handle more connections?
[1:10:41] timinator193: Maybe full reset, power cycle

[1:11:23] Senoquese: @Senoquese try this if you havent, its the top answer for me on google
[1:11:24] SaintanickClause: nice outfit though! BegWan
[1:11:37] Senoquese: @AyukiAkiba i do remember her previous 2 phones occasionally disconnecting
[1:11:49] demon_dandy: Ohhh ashton51Tehe
[1:11:59] AyukiAkiba: @Senoquese not as much as right now, especially if she just imported the burner settings
[1:11:59] Senoquese: like this happened multiple times this donothon without this new phone
[1:12:35] Romblymo: is it an 11 or a 12?
[1:12:39] AyukiAkiba: yeah then it should be behaving identically. i think the the wifi card on your "new" phone is damaged
[1:12:53] Senoquese: @Senoquese try this either way, top answer on google and couldnt hurt
[1:13:04] PSYCOMMUnist: if it's ebay they have a generous return policy

[1:17:00] Bambis_Mother: Have you tried watching Rick and Morty to improve your IQ
[1:17:09] outrunthewind: I used to work a tech support line like 20 years ago, and yes, people are that stupid. I even had people that INSISTED that they had restarted it when they had not
[1:17:24] timinator193: Asking the basic questions is annoying but the solution is usually simple and it's best to fix the problem with no hassle
[1:18:13] PSYCOMMUnist: 720??? atpOld
[1:18:25] bunbunloafy: hi Ashton!!! how’s the donathon going??
[1:18:43] Romblymo: "I shut it off all the time win+L" - one of the heads of american hl7 standards
[1:18:46] PSYCOMMUnist: The 720 is from 2014...
[1:18:49] outrunthewind: There's a reason why they have the phone tree menu reminds people to restart their device before it even gives you an option to continue to other things now

[1:32:55] DerSeelander: I won't name names ofc
[1:32:59] DavidPortnov: I agree.
[1:33:01] Romblymo: 2 years ago I delved into those vods to catch up, I like to think other insane pitcrew also made that pilgrimage
[1:33:05] demon_dandy: I try not to dwell too much but i love to remember everything ashton51Baby
[1:33:10] Senoquese: no way i feel youd be really sad if you left and none of us missed you like well thats life LOL

[1:34:49] DavidPortnov: I watch the yaps I missed mostly.
[1:34:53] justchiken: I like being able to see past vods, I think it helps me understand the streamer more.
[1:34:56] Senoquese: i dont take that many photos but i look at every one i take 🥀

[1:35:02] timinator193: @DavidPortnov same

[1:35:33] demon_dandy: @noodsdood69 theres a bit in the brc stream where we make her cry and it makes emo still ashton51Heyyy

[1:37:05] quotemon: oh me three
[1:37:09] Kitkattack: sometimes I go and watch a stream I missed on my commute but mostly I just check out streams I have really fond memories of. It would suck if that one VOD someone adored got deleted
[1:37:17] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe i have a really bad memory usually i just somehow got hyperfixated on you ashton51ICANT
[1:37:28] The_Great_Moof: that's just talking, tho. everyone got the same topics they go to. like my one slightly older friend and his ten same takes on Star Trek.
[1:37:29] phatscout: I do have to ask, is it weird to have a bunch of randos on the internet who remember like everything you say way more than you do yourself?
[1:37:30] Romblymo: I think we like you more than you think
[1:37:42] phatscout: like I'd have to imagine that's really weird in general right?
[1:37:46] demon_dandy: If you missed ashton playing and you love hamtaro, theres only one place to go ashton51Sus

[1:39:21] outrunthewind: Hey, I'm boring, but I like a lot of the same stuff you do so it's fun to hang out and chat
[1:39:27] The_Great_Moof: i think its more fun/interesting to be here with you & the pit crew than watchin Netflixslop
[1:39:28] timinator193: ashton51Smile
[1:39:29] Donkler57: You are actually one of the funniest streamers I know

[1:39:56] Bambis_Mother: local court jester thinks she isn't funny enough but the king always chortles at her antics
[1:39:57] justchiken: ninoegICANT buh
[1:40:00] Romblymo: thats completely false, you're like beloved among many
[1:40:01] rikkaonline: this is like next level "they just arent telling me im... special, and everyone can tell"
[1:40:04] DavidPortnov: But that's assuming you're watching Netflix slop and not Cinema.

[1:41:06] noodsdood69: I'd rather be here watching you than watching Gachiakuta or Bleach :)
[1:41:12] The_Great_Moof: @DavidPortnov i grew up just watching shit tons of movies and anime. i've seen so much that it's hard to get excited for even great new movies.
[1:41:27] DerSeelander: Is it worse if Pitcrew gush about you in front of you to other Pitcrew, or if we compliment you directly to your face?
[1:41:29] AyukiAkiba: im honored you remembered me
[1:41:31] JaAmfan: ashton51Baby

[1:42:34] DavidPortnov: Offkai meet and greet was maybe a couple streams in for me.
[1:42:40] Kitkattack: Senoquese looks like Salvador Dali
[1:42:40] spikebomb5: did ashton ever do a 'name 100 men/women' game?
[1:42:44] Senoquese: @Kitkattack WHAT
[1:42:44] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:42:50] JaAmfan: Actually i don't think ive been to a meet n greet i always have some random conflict at the last second

[1:43:57] DerSeelander: Can you do Sporcle quizzes for the Donothon?
[1:44:05] JaAmfan: @DavidPortnov Sadly no, i only cosplayed vtubers at offkai this year
[1:44:10] DavidPortnov: @JaAmfan Ah, ok.
[1:44:17] DavidPortnov: What about Kawaii?
[1:44:20] Kitkattack: so how was your canes last night girl?
[1:44:22] JaAmfan: wwparaShake
[1:44:23] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[1:44:27] DerSeelander: "Name all Hololive members" quiz
[1:44:27] Red__2: all the sporcle
[1:44:30] Senoquese: also it doesnt seem obvious because of how uncultured i am but ashton is the only vtuber ive been really fixated with despite me starting to watch vtubers all the way back with kizuna ai Classic thats gotta mean something
[1:44:31] DavidPortnov: Nice!
[1:44:55] DavidPortnov: Funny enough, I got into some Kawaii vtubers, but after they disbanced.
[1:45:32] spikebomb5: a closed ecosystem
[1:45:43] The_Great_Moof: the "walled garden" situation
[1:45:44] AyukiAkiba: i was that way until 2021, then i started watching indies
[1:45:52] DavidPortnov: Yeah, my friend is one of those. Hololive only. It's easier to follow them logistically. I don't blame him.
[1:46:01] Kitkattack: you single handedly brought me back to twitch after a long ass hiatus back when I was watching speedrunners back in 2012
[1:46:09] DerSeelander: B-b-based
[1:46:13] DerSeelander: To be fair
[1:46:16] vermillion2002: I barely even look at corpos these days
[1:46:20] DavidPortnov: @Kitkattack Me too!
[1:46:24] Romblymo: I was always insane, I watched random japanese people talk about there days with an anime png on screen
[1:46:29] Yergos: I definitely never got super into vtubers until I discovered you from virtual vacation, all my friends were mainly corpo vtuber fans
[1:46:31] vermillion2002: @Kitkattack are you me?
[1:46:35] DerSeelander: I think the indie scene has changed MASSIVELY since like 2021
[1:46:39] TheAsterite: I think I only watch indie vtubers ashton51Tehe when they go corporate I stop watching
[1:46:51] timinator193: I found you through a raid but I genuinely don't typically watch twitch
[1:46:59] demon_dandy: That is so fate seno plopped in here LOL
[1:47:06] timinator193: But I come back as often as I can
[1:47:09] JaAmfan: You were the first indie I watched despite being a vtuber fan since 2018 ashton51Squish
[1:47:13] AG_Radium226: I manly watch Indie Vtubers, though if I can catch a rare stream from one of the Hololive EN streams. Again, timezones are a pain for the European Vtuber fan.
[1:47:39] Bambis_Mother: there are still so many pre-debut vtweeters out there
[1:47:41] Senoquese: @demon_dandy LOL i have so many times tried to find the one post that was talking about ashton that made me click but its gotta be gone, it really was fate
[1:47:58] DavidPortnov: @Bambis_Mother Oh yeah, I get follows from them once in a while.

[1:48:39] ReyJaggy: in na'vi voice "i see you ashton marten"

[2:39:26] redactedenheim: they should mix it up, swap out the yeti with president lincoln
[2:39:51] phatscout: I remember seeing one of those Travel Channel "the making of the rides" things about the yeti and how it was the craziest animatronic thing ever made and then I went on it and even as like, a 9 year old or whatever it was an insane letdown
[2:40:20] The_Great_Moof: putting sensitive electronics next to the air what likes to eat sensitive electronics.
[2:40:21] phatscout: for context, they can't run the yeti animatronic because it'll cause structural damage to the ride building so it just stands there and disco lights go off

[2:46:19] phatscout: I watched a video of Test Track 3 and it seems better than 2 but still not as good as 1

[4:41:24] DavidPortnov: Full-time streaming is maybe even less than you do normally in some cases.
[4:41:25] DerSeelander: Does it make you wonder how some streamers can do regular 8 to 11 hour streams?
[4:41:25] nacko_yo: fulll time streamers still just do 3-5 hours only

[4:42:41] Senoquese: like 0 joke 0 playing it up, dont do that you already stream a lot
[4:42:51] rikkaonline: go look at the big fulltime streamers on twitchtracker and check their hours streamed per week
[4:42:55] rikkaonline: it probably less than you
[4:42:57] timinator193: @Senoquese Fr
[4:43:23] redactedenheim: ashtons are like onions, delicious on pizza but you wouldn't want to eat a whole one

[9:18:16] Senoquese: i deserved that bonk

[9:23:55] AlexDD00: I haven't heard Beri talk about it, but I don't catch all her streams
[9:24:02] Burr11: was kind of an odd time of year to schedule it
[9:24:09] Burr11: everyone must be busy
[9:24:10] DerSeelander: I feel like chat should sometimes be a little cheeky because doesn't it feel fake if chat is always being 100% nice to you?
[9:24:13] shindigs: they had to delay it but yeah put it during the holidays
[9:24:21] Qrockpot: beri has been really into morrowind
[9:24:22] shindigs: but imo people who did play were very locked in

[9:25:08] DavidPortnov: @DerSeelander I agree, but we get there if we need to.
[9:25:10] shindigs: brother everyone who codes anything is using AI rn lol
[9:25:14] DavidPortnov: ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap
[9:25:26] demon_dandy: You got the crown?? ICANT
[9:25:28] rikkaonline: bullshit dont slander me like that
[9:25:29] DerSeelander: @DavidPortnov Absolutely
[9:25:44] BlazeKong64: Speaking of GTA, are they still changing when they predict 6 will come out?
[9:26:04] Burr11: all my friends constantly use Claude Code at work now ICANT
[9:26:17] outrunthewind: Everyone's using AI code, but AI code is buggy and inefficient so everything is constantly breaking
[9:26:18] shindigs: i felt that the server was way more stable this yeawr
[9:26:20] DavidPortnov: I will say, I do my best to bully Ashton in MK World (and anyone else) through gameplay.
[9:26:29] ThrowRacket: i wish this game did something interesting with its open world, like imagine exploring to find secrets and stuff
[9:26:35] rikkaonline: people using ai to code love writing themselves some shitty code to have to fix later i guess
[9:27:14] shindigs: no no elaborate
[9:27:17] shindigs: curious on your thoughts
[9:27:21] shindigs: >:)
[9:27:22] Senoquese: imo damn is it depressing to be a modder and seeing more and more people vibe code them entirely like it replacing jobs isnt a dystopian thing its happening now
[9:27:23] DavidPortnov: Good 'ol homegrown spaghetti code is where it's at!
[9:27:33] demon_dandy: LOL
[9:27:42] iffity: smh creator farming content
[9:27:48] DavidPortnov: Yes, definitely.
[9:28:15] iffity: LUL
[9:28:16] RayneHellfire: ChatGPT waifu
[9:28:23] rikkaonline: i think it should be clear from context that ai hate is concentrated on generative ai. no one should be using a chatbot to write code
[9:28:28] demon_dandy: We know how you feel about AI ashton51Nightmare the cat especially
[9:28:34] Senoquese: @rikkaonline agree
[9:28:35] iffity: yep yuep
[9:28:36] John_MarioKart: vocaloids aren’t ai tho
[9:28:48] shindigs: people like neuro but neuro is generative AI
[9:28:51] iffity: @rikkaonline well.... they do do that tho

[9:28:55] shindigs: to be clear i like the neuro project a lot
[9:28:58] DavidPortnov: Overall win. Nice!
[9:28:58] demon_dandy: ICANT she dont even know
[9:28:59] Senoquese: neuro is locally trained not scraped
[9:29:04] DavidPortnov: ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap
[9:29:05] pogotross: man ashton really wants to be in ANOTHER FalseEyeD video
[9:29:07] shindigs: @Senoquese does he know lol
[9:29:10] BlazeKong64: I personally feel like AI should be an assistant and not a means to an end on things like people are using it nowadays
[9:29:14] pantalaimon91: ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap
[9:29:17] Erjoc: These echo chambers be echoing
[9:29:19] TheAsterite: @Senoquese nah, neuro has it's base in scraped ai
[9:29:19] BlazeKong64: Since people get TOO reliant on it these days
[9:29:27] iffity: the goal post is movin
[9:29:27] rikkaonline: neuro is a chatbot
[9:29:37] shindigs: and neuro is good, but i think its clear the lines are unclear
[9:29:39] DavidPortnov: I mean, hopefully Vedal isn't lying about that. Have to hope he's telling the truth.
[9:29:50] pogotross: om you really don't want to piss off the neuro stans
[9:30:01] shindigs: if it was vibe coded the server was way better vibe coded imo
[9:30:04] TheAsterite: he did additional training with his chat, but the base is scraped
[9:30:06] DerSeelander: Coding models are getting pretty good now, it's scary.
[9:30:16] shindigs: but i didnt do any real jobs like emt etc
[9:30:25] spring_bonfie: Vroom
[9:30:28] Red__2: She made a take. Twitter, killer her
[9:30:31] iffity: nah its very fair to keep out of it if its not really your area of expertise the last thing i'd want is redditors misrepresenting your opinion with their ERM ACKTUALLY
[9:30:43] outrunthewind: I'm rooting for neuro because I feel like they'll be the ones who save us from the emotionless terminator AI that GPT, Google, et al are making
[9:30:53] ThrowRacket: final destination no items
[9:31:01] John_MarioKart: another knockout tour?
[9:31:06] BlazeKong64: You think they'll add 200cc sometime?
[9:31:15] ReyJaggy: I miss Spanish Ashton ai voice
[9:31:20] iffity: no 200cc mirror is so interestin
[9:31:23] John_MarioKart: I hope they add 200
[9:31:27] demon_dandy: LOLLLL
[9:31:35] ArthurWar: The first big content update for this game will be a spectacle simply because they're taking so long
[9:31:39] demon_dandy: 200cc seems like itd really fit
[9:31:44] fixedspectacles2014: What about 250cc ashton51Steer
[9:31:47] applecadough: Who
[9:31:48] ThrowRacket: neuro is an evolved chatbot
[9:31:50] ThrowRacket: basically
[9:31:54] Senoquese: what i do know is that i used to develop for servers so hearing of one being vibe coded feels personal as that is *my* job that is being replaced
[9:31:59] shindigs: it doesnt matter. neuro is fun, that's all
[9:32:04] rikkaonline: id put it this way: what level of your engineering work would you be willing to put your stamp on an ai's work? that's why sw can be vibes - we have no responsibility for our work
[9:32:09] pantalaimon91: She has extremely short term memory and can fly on wild tangents
[9:32:27] iffity: thats the sort of thing chat loves though
[9:32:28] icestickerart: through shade at neuro's intelligence, so Neuro is a AUI
[9:32:29] demon_dandy: The neuro clips that went viral recently have people lookin into the sunset ICANT
[9:32:53] rikkaonline: latter
[9:32:54] icestickerart: if I recall neuro was mostly trained on Vedal's chat so streamer truly reflects chat
[9:32:58] demon_dandy: No like they feel touched Life
[9:32:59] Senoquese: oh yeah LOL her becoming "sentient" and all ashton51Tehe
[9:33:00] iffity: @demon_dandy life is beautiful looking or life is so cooked loooking
[9:33:06] ThrowRacket: in a way we all are chatbots
[9:33:12] iffity: om
[9:33:12] ReyJaggy: i like the idea that evil neuro is actually good and Neuro is just a straight up sociopath
[9:33:17] pogotross: huh
[9:33:22] iffity: okay i dont know about all that
[9:33:24] bonatide: You think shell have that many kids?
[9:33:28] snowypurple512: Context?
[9:33:34] demon_dandy: LOL bonatide
[9:33:35] ArthurWar: That's evil LOL
[9:33:36] SaintanickClause: I've always felt that way HypeNotLikeSnow  now am here
[9:33:40] ThrowRacket: bug
[9:33:41] yojamjam: short memory and wild tangents, my vtuber can do that without ai
[9:33:48] icestickerart: in 500 years Neuro will be thew Genghis Kahn
[9:33:51] shindigs: not sure how we got here

[9:33:56] demon_dandy: @yojamjam Trueeee ashton51Blehhh
[9:33:56] iffity: is it like that one mcdonalds ad with the family
[9:34:03] pogotross: if cute girls doing cute things anime couldn't save Japan...
[9:34:06] DavidPortnov: I look at her as less of a daughter and much more of a personal art project.
[9:34:09] ThrowRacket: the problem with birthrates is that we are in an extreme economic decline and people literally cant afford to marry let alone have children
[9:34:10] timinator193: "chud daughter" ashton51Cringe
[9:34:24] SaintanickClause: HypeLUL
[9:34:27] snowypurple512: True, it's a very wholesome daughters father relationship
[9:34:29] demon_dandy: Especially japan side apparently
[9:34:29] DavidPortnov: @ThrowRacket This exactly.
[9:34:29] BlazeKong64: GG @John_MarioKart
[9:34:39] icestickerart: people going to have babies to raise their own stream daughter
[9:34:39] Senoquese: iirc the clip that got big was neuro asking vedal if she was made solely for entertainment and if she could ever become real
[9:34:48] snowypurple512: Especially with how adorable the Disneyworld vid was
[9:34:49] pogotross: @ThrowRacket ironically birthrates are inversely correlated with income, so they'll probably start going up
[9:34:53] BlazeKong64: I've tried to talk to chatbots before, and yeah they do have severe memory loss
[9:34:55] shindigs: its just interesting genuinely to see people go to bat for neuro but not for anything else.  vedal did a pretty insane job
[9:34:58] F1nalStarman: ShouldiCelebrate ShouldiCelebrate ShouldiCelebrate
[9:35:23] pogotross: she slipped in before AI started fucking with artists
[9:35:31] iffity: neuro is like the atlas of positive gen ai LUL
[9:35:40] SaintanickClause: it doesn't seem the same when vedal puts effort into it... but i dunno how much work that'd be
[9:35:49] aureliangates: hasnt neuro been around since before the real big ai boom
[9:35:49] DavidPortnov: @iffity True, true.
[9:35:52] aureliangates: or am i misremembering
[9:35:54] John_MarioKart: plus the obligatory route to
[9:36:14] demon_dandy: ashtonPLEASE
[9:36:16] Senoquese: @aureliangates she has and i think thats part of the big difference for me
[9:36:38] shindigs: it's kayfabe within kayfabe
[9:36:43] shindigs: its so well done tho
[9:37:07] rikkaonline: the veneer of life on even the best ai is super thin
[9:37:07] ThrowRacket: Mario kart world moment
[9:37:09] bonatide: When they made her a car she seemed like a cooler idog
[9:37:15] ReyJaggy: 5 checkpoints
[9:37:20] demon_dandy: This rainbow road is beautiful but also really really big
[9:37:22] ArthurWar: Yeah
[9:37:41] aureliangates: @Senoquese thank u ashton51Wave i agree!
[9:37:55] TheAsterite: neuro the chat bot debuted a month after chatgpt publicly released ashton51Nerd
[9:38:07] DavidPortnov: I literally just got a reddit notification of someone surprised that they love Neuro.
[9:38:07] snowypurple512: I'm content with three green shell... Two seconds later
[9:38:10] shindigs: remember teh steamed hams AI channel
[9:38:10] demon_dandy: I cant believe this fuck ass cloud is meta ICANT
[9:38:13] shindigs: RIP
[9:38:22] pogotross: so to change the topic...religion tierlist?
[9:38:28] TheAsterite: vibe coding keeps me in business
[9:38:30] TheAsterite: imaEvil
[9:38:31] DerSeelander: Most of the best programmers are using it to augment their abilities
[9:38:39] yojamjam: bibme is now part of chegg
[9:38:43] demon_dandy: @shindigs oh my god or the family guy one
[9:38:48] bunzel_ch: any program  efficiency minded programmer would be against vibe coding yeah, but most people arent like that sadly
[9:38:48] rikkaonline: we dotn have standards like real engineering. hold us legally responsible for our work and attitudes would change fast
[9:38:49] shindigs: it was, not as good as steamed hams
[9:38:49] ArthurWar: Yeah, there were a lot of those lol
[9:38:52] DerSeelander: It speeds up a lot of menial coding
[9:38:52] bonatide: No that was the vas

[9:38:53] shindigs: steamed hams had an aura
[9:38:56] F1nalStarman: AI Sponge was the funniest of that bunch for me for sure
[9:38:56] DavidPortnov: The AI Spongebob was so good!
[9:39:00] aureliangates: did you guys watch the ai family guy when it first started, that shit was actually so fucking funny
[9:39:36] pantalaimon91: Chegg was extremely helpful when my professor couldn't teach their way out of a wet paper bag
[9:39:44] Erjoc: Grammerly was a good service for proper punctuation, now all it does is prompt you to use ai written essays
[9:39:44] TheAsterite: this track was so rare to get online
[9:39:47] yojamjam: it's older than "it's on tubi" but same joke, also it's a merger that actually happened
[9:40:06] demon_dandy: Its like a touch of all the previous rainbow roads
[9:40:08] DavidPortnov: That's surprising.
[9:40:19] rikkaonline: ai is even replacing the rocks ashton51Despair
[9:40:21] ArthurWar: Presentation on this course is fantastic, even if it's a tad long
[9:40:43] DavidPortnov: They went graphics go brrr with this one.
[9:40:49] Senoquese: LOL
[9:40:50] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[9:40:51] rikkaonline: true
[9:40:55] yojamjam: that train has to be an allusion to galaxy railroad
[9:40:56] ArthurWar: Sakurai's been saying it's the last Smash since Brawl LMAO
[9:40:57] Erjoc: The memorial Mario kart
[9:41:03] bonatide: Melee was the last smash
[9:41:07] rikkaonline: hopefully this game gets the depth to justify that
[9:41:07] F1nalStarman: No Waluigi in smash D:
[9:41:10] pogotross: I wonder if FnaF will be in the next smash
[9:41:17] TheAsterite: it's ok, sakurai got to make air riders
[9:41:18] DerSeelander: Did you see the Tekken guy Harada appearing in a Vtuber's stream?
[9:41:20] snowypurple512: Especially since there's no number attached to it
[9:41:33] demon_dandy: Thank you thank you ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[9:41:36] Erjoc: Sakurai should wear the Harada "don't ask me for shit" shirt
[9:41:37] Senoquese: what are you doing LOL
[9:41:41] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[9:41:44] snowypurple512: Noooo the losses
[9:42:00] ArthurWar: This game hates when you go slightly off-course, they would never let you ashton51Omegalul
[9:42:16] pogotross: Ashton first, the rest nowhere
[9:42:19] BlazeKong64: Honestly, I feel the Sakurai comment resonates with Kirby Air Riders more since he said "Here's everything. We're not adding anymore content. This is the full game."
[9:42:20] F1nalStarman: ashton51Clap ashton51Clap ashton51Clap
[9:42:22] John_MarioKart: @ArthurWar nope I’ve seen it done I think
[9:42:34] TheAsterite: there are a couple skips on rainbow road, they're hard to pull off
[9:43:01] snowypurple512: This kinda makes me want to boot up forza horizon
[9:43:03] spikebomb5: not every game needs dlc or live service support
[9:43:05] yojamjam: kirby air riders wrapped fast so that they can mk8 deluxeify smash ultimate
[9:43:14] snowypurple512: Too bad I don't have Xbox ultimate anymore lol

[9:46:45] demon_dandy: You liked mario oddyssey no?
[9:46:49] ArthurWar: It depends on what you're going into it thinking it'll be
[9:46:55] BlazeKong64: You might like Bananza
[9:46:58] TheAsterite: youd probably like bananza then
[9:46:59] pogotross: seems like a safe bet then
[9:47:02] John_MarioKart: you’ll like Bananza then
[9:47:07] demon_dandy: Wait you dont like monkeys... ashton51Despair
[9:47:13] ArthurWar: It's the same team as Odyssey so in theory you would like it
[9:47:14] YuiSuzukaze: keydgeSteer

[9:48:26] Erjoc: Some people aren't puzzle brained
[9:48:34] demon_dandy: Well i know people who dont wanna play blue prince cause they dont like the puzzle feeling LOL
[9:48:38] SaintanickClause: fr it was cool
[9:48:45] DavidPortnov: I here the tedium issue most often.

[9:49:27] DavidPortnov: If someone donates to the donothon, I'm buying Blue Prince.
[9:49:30] yojamjam: oh are we talking about switch 2 having no games

[9:49:41] demon_dandy: LOL
[9:50:00] snowypurple512: What is MK world on??
[9:50:04] TheAsterite: @snowypurple512 it's a knockout tour
[9:50:16] YuiSuzukaze: I looked up blueprints mooferICANT
[9:50:23] demon_dandy: I can understand not fw bloop just cause you dont like the puzzle gamey and slow pace but it is amazing
[9:50:26] DavidPortnov: @YuiSuzukaze You got the pun!
[9:50:31] Erjoc: Mori calliope?
[9:50:33] pantalaimon91: Wait Calli is here??
[9:50:35] snowypurple512: @TheAsterite Okay, like an endurance race?
[9:50:35] Erjoc: Death?
[9:50:37] TheAsterite: out of all the modes in this game that should've been randomized, it was knockout mode Classic
[9:50:44] Sultansekte: i really like blue prince so far, had the first "ending" but it's harder to search for progression after it so far
[9:50:46] DavidPortnov: @Erjoc Oh! Took me a secone.
[9:50:58] DavidPortnov: Good ol' Dad.
[9:51:20] TheAsterite: instead of having only like 8 fixed knockout tour circuits
[9:51:24] ArthurWar: I think I agree, like this mode should have something for random routes
[9:51:37] demon_dandy: No she had a 20 episode playthrough
[9:51:41] Erjoc: The game didn't have an ending like she wanted
[9:51:46] DavidPortnov: She got really into it.
[9:51:46] Senoquese: @demon_dandy holy shit
[9:51:50] ArthurWar: She loved it so much but was unsatisfied with the lack of a true ending
[9:51:53] pantalaimon91: I believe it was because it didn't win anything
[9:52:08] sunkist_777: what is blueprrints?
[9:52:13] SaintanickClause: to be fair you can have more than one opinion but interesting to think about for sure! BegWan
[9:52:15] Erjoc: There's no like, final role credits ending, and Kiara was disappointed
[9:52:19] SaintanickClause: it is a game called blue prince
[9:52:25] demon_dandy: Kiara did everything in bloop tbh
[9:52:44] outrunthewind: She LOVES the game a lot, but was unsatisfied with the end
[9:53:08] ArthurWar: Like that game had its feelers in her brain hardcore, I've not seen that many games get that kind of a runtime and then when we hit the true ending it was super unsatisfying for her
[9:53:11] DavidPortnov: On that I can agree.
[9:53:19] pantalaimon91: I actually love stuff that just kind of ends
[9:53:29] DavidPortnov: The wabi sabi of the unfinished manga.
[9:53:38] bonatide: She's such a mannerist ashton51Love
[9:53:40] YuiSuzukaze: mooferLockedin

[9:55:08] bonatide: I refused to finish kaguya cuz i wanna just enjoy what i read
[9:55:15] pogotross: om
[9:55:20] aureliangates: the last one that really pissed me off was the hokkaido gyaru one
[9:55:23] bonatide: I was day 1 kaguya too
[9:55:24] demon_dandy: Oshi no ko imo was flawed from concept kinda ashton51Tehe
[9:55:28] Erjoc: Look out, the manga reader is gonna tell you why everything you like is wrong

[9:55:47] bonatide: He didn't rush that shit at all
[9:55:52] BlazeKong64: To everybody I ran over with the truck on the bridge section earlier, my bad lol
[9:55:59] demon_dandy: @bonatide LOL
[9:56:15] bonatide: Akasaka got some things to answer for
[9:56:21] pogotross: om so many old Go Nagai manga ended with "and then everyone killed each other and died" because of editors and magazines
[9:56:27] John_MarioKart: Shock dodge for the win let’s go
[9:56:32] nacko_yo: feels like i was fighting for my life during that
[9:56:42] Senoquese: what?? if you dislike the ending imo you should criticize and harass the entire studio and staff Clueless
[9:56:55] BlazeKong64: Also, as someone who played DK Bananza, just to throw my thoughts out on it since we mentioned it earlier: I personally loved the game. Getting used to DK's new design took some time, but I think it's kinda cute
[9:56:58] demon_dandy: The arc before the actual ending was what id brawl with akasaka for
[9:57:05] snowypurple512: Okay now I sleep frfr, have a good donothon!!!!
[9:57:07] DavidPortnov: @BlazeKong64 Same here.
[9:57:08] pogotross: death threats are really love threats if you think about it
[9:57:11] bonatide: They make us do this
[9:57:16] BlazeKong64: Also, there's some other stuff I love about Bananza, but it's spoiler territory and I would rather people play the game and see it for themselves
[9:57:23] John_MarioKart: I got a boo in the section before the last lap and shock dodged and that basically secured my victory
[9:57:32] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[9:57:33] DavidPortnov: @snowypurple512 Goodnight!
