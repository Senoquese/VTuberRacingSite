[1:11:21] niertlwal: ok ok ok but also when is ashton getting her own custom winamp skin
[1:11:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: and itll actually sound good
[1:11:25] Navy_Mongoose: 8 track was like cassettes, but older
[1:11:27] SpaceCircles: what about mp4? Is that any good? TheVoices
[1:11:30] Kitkattack: yeah no one has golden ears it's really not a world of a difference
[1:11:30] T33bags: 8 track is a shittier cassette
[1:11:34] MysticAXe: vinyal - 8track- cassetes
[1:11:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: mp4 is video lol
[1:11:38] demon_dandy: are you gonna press vinyls didnt you say that was expensive? ashton51Tehe
[1:11:43] phatscout: there's a lower snr ratio on the average vinyl than a flac
[1:11:48] c_v_catullus16: How are you feeling tonight, Ashton?
[1:11:48] Kitkattack: 8track is actually trash tier
[1:11:48] niertlwal: pressing vinyls are hella expensive
[1:11:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @demon_dandy you are paying for the aesthetic
[1:11:50] rikkaonline: its like that irl
[1:11:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the corners have lights yes
[1:12:02] thomas2uentin: there was almost a crash

[1:12:14] niertlwal: a winamp skin would kinda bang tho...
[1:12:19] BearerOfPeas: i didn't grow up in a place with streetlights, so i wouldn't notice that
[1:12:22] zer0hazard: in 4th stage there's a roadkill incident
[1:12:23] SpaceCircles: what did you eat for dinner?

[1:12:35] fsteakk: omg she does not know winamp
[1:12:35] rikkaonline: i am aging rapidly
[1:12:35] T33bags: buying it on laser disc
[1:12:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: RIP
[1:12:38] Navy_Mongoose: winamp was so cash
[1:12:40] barfchan: zoomer moment....
[1:12:40] c_v_catullus16: Is it still hot in Wisconsin? It already cooled down here in Ohio.
[1:12:43] niertlwal: it's time....
[1:12:44] JTBun: @demon_dandy yeah vinyl is pretty pricy and you usually need a like a few 100 to the manufacturers to even consider
[1:12:49] rikkaonline: winamp was THE audio player
[1:12:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: nope
[1:12:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it was an audio player
[1:12:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: before itunes
[1:12:59] ShinRyuful: how you know that song
[1:12:59] BearerOfPeas: @mrp0p1nfr3sh i'm surprised nobody cloned it
[1:13:00] rikkaonline: it really whips the llamas ass
[1:13:04] niertlwal: no, winamp was spotify before everything else
[1:13:07] MysticAXe: just google 8track
[1:13:08] zer0hazard: @rikkaonline this
[1:13:11] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:13:11] Navy_Mongoose: it was a media player, like VLC
[1:13:12] MysticAXe: its the first cassete
[1:13:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it had skins
[1:13:14] thomas2uentin: you could put custom skins on it
[1:13:15] ShinRyuful: yeah
[1:13:16] geotoaster: Im reminded every day watching vTubers that I am, in fact, old
[1:13:19] barfchan: the custom skins were insane
[1:13:22] SpaceCircles: Unfortunately whenever I eat beef it makes my tummy hurt FeelsBadMan
[1:13:26] T33bags: its worser cassestte
[1:13:29] thomas2uentin: it's bigger than a cassette
[1:13:31] ShinRyuful: Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape
[1:13:32] JTBun: no 8 track is an old audio format
[1:13:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I WANT THE ASHTON SONG ON HITCLIPS
[1:13:35] rikkaonline: 8 track was a low quality portable audio medium from before casettes were common
[1:13:38] Kitkattack: oh no it's like an awful cassette
[1:13:39] c_v_catullus16: 8-track: Isn't that a small audio-casette tape?

[1:13:47] niertlwal: https://skins.webamp.org/
[1:13:51] niertlwal: check this site
[1:13:51] ShinRyuful: this is the song ---> Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape
[1:13:55] c_v_catullus16: Mr. Puff from Spongebob is dead.
[1:13:56] niertlwal: it has a history of a lot of winamp skins
[1:14:05] insomniyawn: when i saw everyone talking about 8track i thought about the site i used to make fandom playlists on when i was 14
[1:14:07] Kitkattack: 8tracks came about in the 70's to give you some perspective
[1:14:09] T33bags: getting racing line live on laser disc
[1:14:18] demon_dandy: no we saw mr puff is a lamp now ashton51Despair
[1:14:30] c_v_catullus16: They show a clip of Mr. Puff as a lamp.
[1:14:31] JTBun: yes
[1:14:32] niertlwal: yes
[1:14:34] rikkaonline: yeah 7"
[1:14:34] JTBun: 7"
[1:14:38] Kitkattack: ashton51Happi ashton51Happi ashton51Happi
[1:14:53] niertlwal: so if you make the master copy that's pretty much 80% of the cost
[1:14:56] rikkaonline: you can make a 12" 45rpm, but 7" is fine
[1:14:56] yojamjam: skibidi torled bside
[1:14:58] MysticAXe: 8 trak
[1:15:00] MysticAXe: now
[1:15:01] MysticAXe: please
[1:15:09] c_v_catullus16: CD because it's easier to switch audio tracks.
[1:15:14] Navy_Mongoose: skibidi berlet
[1:15:17] MysticAXe: no
[1:15:19] Kitkattack: cd hardly makes sense either, might as well go full retro
[1:15:19] JTBun: you would need a few hundred manufactured to even consider vinyl
[1:15:20] MysticAXe: sorry Atrack
[1:15:27] Navy_Mongoose: I liked CDs
[1:15:29] niertlwal: 8track is a predecessor to cassettes
[1:15:29] rikkaonline: 8 track is a media format that preceeded cassettes. it SUCKS
[1:15:33] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: i like cassette , i feel like it fits for some reason
[1:15:33] yojamjam: the deadest of dead formats
[1:15:42] insomniyawn: it looks like the site is named after like. not vinyl players but they look like it
[1:15:45] T33bags: lmaoooooooo 8track is a physical media the site is some cashgrab bullshit
[1:15:47] thomas2uentin: Japanese train otaku can be scary
[1:15:54] zer0hazard: really is a waste to press a full vinyl for less than 20 min of audio
[1:15:54] MysticAXe: 8-track tapes are the first casste for music and stuff before normal cassetes
[1:15:58] niertlwal: ok chicago public transport vs NYC transport
[1:16:03] niertlwal: which one is better
[1:16:11] Kitkattack: to bad we'll never the the north south "L" route
[1:16:20] demon_dandy: Old trains are pretty neat
[1:16:21] rikkaonline: i dont care about trains much, but japan got me acting up about them
[1:16:35] JTBun: trains are cool
[1:16:37] c_v_catullus16: Great! Now I have "Different Trains" by Steve Reich stuck in my head.
[1:16:39] niertlwal: i do love old trains
[1:16:50] demon_dandy: We got some in the south island here and its very charming ashton51Tehe
[1:16:54] thebreadstick0: hewwo mousey
[1:17:07] niertlwal: japanese trains would destroy ashton
[1:17:16] niertlwal: but she would also get lost in the shibuya tunnels
[1:17:31] thebreadstick0: singing :>
[1:17:36] siIlyworm: ashton51Stare
[1:17:38] T33bags: chicago is the best in US. nyc has more capicity for riders because streets have more traffic but by time and frequency of stops through the city chicago beats it i think
[1:17:52] niertlwal: uptown and downtown
[1:17:57] niertlwal: that's p much all it is

[3:15:54] demon_dandy: Doesnt it go red if you get it wrong?
[3:16:05] T33bags: no like they only give 5 individual numbers
