[4:00:44] NorfiVT: Aah ait, thought she was because of the reflections but that's the mapping
[4:00:48] Cannonaire: Portal and Portal 2 are literally perfect games. Or at least, the closest to perfect I've ever seen a game.
[4:00:49] RycegoZ: What if her name wasn't Glad0s but instead Freak0s and insead of trying to kill you, she tried to suck your toes instead
[4:00:50] avfusion: when this game out, I was 16 and I saved up all my money to build a new computer. This was the first game I played on it
[4:00:59] the_ol_regular: Urgh, can't believe thr big bad evil corporation Valve would plagiarize from the small indie game (I'm joking)

[4:56:05] InsaneLoke: yoy also have the advantage of being a puzzle solving adult with a stem degree
[4:56:10] DatBoiVLC: Well, maybe your cousin wasn't a STEM major ashton51Tensai
[4:56:17] Senoquese: girl

[4:56:26] Navy_Mongoose: you used it in that jumpy room
[4:56:30] rikkaonline: its the same thing youd been doing lol
[4:56:34] demon_dandy: You did the jump room ashton51Tehe
[4:56:38] niertlwal: i think it was just the concept of launching/momentum
[4:56:49] StreamElements: Get your scrungly Ashton Plushten before they're gone! https://studionekomata.com/collections/ashton-marten
[4:56:50] Senoquese: its just flinging but with a different direction
[4:56:53] rikkaonline: it doesn't
[4:56:59] Bentosity: Well yeah, Portals have gravity, duh
[4:57:01] Navy_Mongoose: no it doesn't, you just accelerate normally
[4:57:02] avfusion: uwoFroggy
[4:57:07] InsaneLoke: its the same thing you did to get up to that point
[4:57:08] Navy_Mongoose: speedy thing go in, speedy thing go out

[4:57:29] Paperguide: i see what you're going with
[4:57:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: thats kinetic energy in a loss based system. Portal relies on a lossless kinetic energy system.
[4:57:33] rikkaonline: do you not remember the big room with several platforms gradually higher?
[4:57:38] niertlwal: anyway bonus maps
[4:57:44] Senoquese: i have no idea what youre talking about tbh LOL
[4:57:44] demon_dandy: The jumpy room ashton51Tehe

[4:58:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: WE NEED PHYSICS INFO FOR RACE CARS
[4:58:38] Senoquese: idk what part of that was unrealistic besides the portal in the first place LMAO
[4:58:38] avfusion: you can beat this game in well under an hour
[4:58:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Gotta make our cars faster
[4:58:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: an hour for a speed run? no thankie
[4:59:00] avfusion: the speedrun is 4 minutes
[4:59:04] demon_dandy: I assure you its nonsensical to watch like mario ashton51Omegalul portal 1 speedrun i think is 5 mins
[4:59:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: OH SHIT 4 MINUTES?!
[4:59:09] yojamjam: how many cheese wheels to intuitively explain moment of inertia

[4:59:33] DatBoiVLC: ^propell those
[4:59:34] Playmer: The video is 9 minutes, but the speed run is like 6

[5:01:09] Playmer: Inbounds
[5:01:30] rikkaonline: id say its not that they add momentum, its that the game has no air resistance
[5:01:35] JTBun: yes
[5:01:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: hes trying to break the game
[5:01:45] JTBun: he's trying to clip
[5:01:49] Paperguide: there are probably glitchless runs
[5:01:53] DatBoiVLC: gonna say the copypasta...
[5:02:00] Playmer: It's both
[5:02:05] Senoquese: the glitchless run is 14 minutes
[5:02:07] T33bags: this tweet and the replies shows how the american schooling institution has failed so many https://x.com/memecrashes/status/1807419232264577104
[5:02:10] avfusion: This is the glitchless run https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6kPFwLnLWA
[5:02:22] demon_dandy: Its true that it does but you didnt use that to solve the puzzle ashton51Tehe
[5:02:26] rikkaonline: if it added momentum, you could have teo horizontal ones and would gain height moving back and forth
[5:02:39] T33bags: A
[5:02:42] avfusion: A

[5:04:11] avfusion: yes
[5:04:12] Senoquese: yes
[5:04:13] JTBun: yes
[5:04:16] avfusion: there's no speedcap going backwards
[5:04:16] Navy_Mongoose: yep
[5:04:19] Navy_Mongoose: same with HL2
[5:04:28] DatBoiVLC: in source they tried to add an anti-bunny hop mechanic
[5:04:39] DatBoiVLC: it gives you negative velocity when you bhop
[5:04:40] InsaneLoke: hl2 soeedruns are even more nuts
[5:04:45] DatBoiVLC: so if you bhop backwards...
[5:04:45] avfusion: Desync on youtube is a great and very funny short-segment speedrunner

[5:06:30] DatBoiVLC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wROIlgTwjE okay this is funny and shorter from desync
[5:06:38] Senoquese: theres a site that lets you connect every map from source games, like hl2 and portal
[5:06:57] Senoquese: there was an interview where the hl2 devs watched a speedrun and they were like "ah this is a classic bug we couldnt fix- i have no fucking idea whats going on anymore"
[5:07:00] Senoquese: so funny
[5:07:15] avfusion: @DatBoiVLC (3 min 43 second video for chinchilla lady)

[5:11:12] Senoquese: apparently the website removed the option of loading every single map at once, but theres videos of it
[5:11:15] Senoquese: https://fxtwitter.com/JasperRLZ/status/1417540332305018881
[5:11:21] InsaneLoke: they try to stop you

[5:12:04] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Angy
[5:12:06] Paperguide: the portal likely has some sort of pull
[5:12:21] Paperguide: it's theoretical
[5:12:23] demon_dandy: You didnt use it to solve that puzzle was the main thing ashton51Tehe its just a quirk of the engine
[5:12:28] Senoquese: i dont think that happens in portal 2? completely forgot thats a thing here
[5:12:29] Paperguide: just like portals
[5:12:30] DatBoiVLC: idk I saw a wormhole the other day
[5:12:35] Paperguide: so it's impossible to know for sure
