[1:05:35] AnimeNerd25: How does any stylist make that hair happen IRL?
[1:05:40] fatcacha: havent you been to japan?

[1:05:53] redactedenheim: she's got a tic tac toe forehead
[1:05:58] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:06:01] InsaneLoke: it looks like art girl who chain smokes and dresses like a russian grandma cut
[1:06:17] DavidPortnov: @InsaneLoke Perfect description.
[1:06:23] ReyJaggy: maybe its to make her look both gyaru and tomboyish, but yeah ive never seen it in real life
[1:06:24] demon_dandy: I cant really pictuee the haircut irl tbh especially on a gyaru
[1:06:33] Red__2: "old anime" "2010s" ashton51Despair ashton51Despair ashton51Despair ashton51Despair

[1:07:18] wernie1: Okay but fucked up hair is really cute imo, I'm a choppy lover
[1:07:18] Burr11: to me it reads like a tomboyish cut? i dunno
[1:07:19] pogotross: idk are his boobs big?
[1:07:22] thomas2uentin: Meijiro Ryan
[1:07:22] pogotross: *her
[1:07:24] eb0ss1: this is 'ugly cute' equivalent for men
[1:07:25] Kitkattack: I'm sure some girls could pull those bangs off
[1:07:28] InsaneLoke: i think its to emphasize the brows
[1:07:30] jherchin12345: not choppy ugly cuts but I think slightly messy hair is cute
[1:07:36] pogotross: then great haircut
[1:07:48] DavidPortnov: I think I'd be more interested if it were a real-life person.
[1:07:52] wernie1: God forbid a girl gets fucked up by her barber man
[1:07:55] redactedenheim: maybe her brother cut her hair
[1:07:59] Burr11: you need to ask some japanese men tbh
[1:08:00] kibyful: IDK i like the haircut but it works better on smaller girls lul
[1:08:06] InsaneLoke: lol
[1:08:07] fatcacha: ashton51Sus ashton51Sus ashton51Sus
[1:08:08] eb0ss1: the authors poorly disguised forehead fetish

[1:08:20] Qrockpot: ashton51Sus
[1:08:29] thomas2uentin: Fuuka from Persona 3
[1:08:33] DavidPortnov: What do the Japanese men know that we don't?
[1:08:40] DavidPortnov: I need to know.
[1:08:49] Qrockpot: the classic ashton yaoi analogy
[1:08:50] Senoquese: true true
[1:08:54] DavidPortnov: Oh yeah, definitely Fuuka.
[1:08:57] Burr11: yeah fuuka is cute
[1:09:12] eb0ss1: dekomori from chuunibyou?
[1:09:13] Kitkattack: it strikes me like techno bossy chick honestly
[1:09:16] Navy_Mongoose: yeah that sounds pretty rad
[1:09:17] fatcacha: fuuka is super cute
[1:09:30] bonatide: Tictactoe on her forehead could save me
[1:09:39] thomas2uentin: ashton51Omegalul
[1:09:40] demon_dandy: Oh yeah LOL
[1:09:40] DavidPortnov: I'm not much of a Fuuka person design-wise.
[1:09:45] Red__2: They're so bland default man
[1:09:50] fatcacha: a girl with a 5 head is so attractive
[1:09:55] Romblymo: Well yaoi sorta has that doesn't it, yaoi face is a term
[1:10:01] redactedenheim: she's got enough forehead for a game of shogi
[1:10:04] fatcacha: like rihanna
[1:10:30] InsaneLoke: i feel like i see similar hair styles on anime girls with that color of light blonde
[1:10:32] wernie1: I need to be able to play connect 4 on my girls head before I put a ring on that finger on god
[1:10:33] keternal: i'm so excited that ashton is real
[1:10:37] Senoquese: the anime girl thinks about anime
[1:10:45] Kitkattack: did you pick up any old series?
[1:10:53] Qrockpot: whats your current backlog anime?
[1:11:04] GManx0: How goes the yapping
[1:11:10] PinkPotatoes: DinoDance
[1:11:23] aureliangates: ashton51Nodders
[1:11:37] Burr11: oh yeah i saw that on the list.. didnt watch though
[1:11:48] Qrockpot: manga usually do look better yeah
[1:12:00] eb0ss1: i guess this is generally true for slop
[1:12:01] GManx0: That is the problem with animation. They need to move
[1:12:02] DavidPortnov: Well, you don't know what you don't know if you don't read the manga.
[1:12:03] olandgren: cries in poor Dorohedoro
[1:12:04] bonatide: Manga is almost always 100x better
[1:12:06] fatcacha: well yeah thats why i read the manga only few animes capture the essence of the manga
[1:12:08] aureliangates: SBR.....
[1:12:08] ThrowRacket: Im not interested in adaptations, i want to see more originals
[1:12:11] fatcacha: @DavidPortnov THIS
[1:12:12] Burr11: Tune into the Midnight heart got such an ugly adapation ashton51Despair
[1:12:15] Qrockpot: elusive samurai s2 announced you should catch up
[1:12:17] pogotross: yeees join the manga team
[1:12:19] GManx0: Auntie Ashton
[1:12:28] niertlwal: manga reading has been the way to go
[1:12:32] DavidPortnov: Also yeah, I'd rather read the manga most of the time.
[1:12:32] pogotross: and then you can start light novels
[1:12:39] Kitkattack: honestly I have that thought a lot more too nowadays
[1:12:42] keternal: honestly i think the real draw of anime isn't "it moves" but "it has voice acting and music"
[1:12:42] maverickdrifter: have you seen undead girl murder farce?
[1:12:44] niertlwal: i'm really glad there's a lot of good apps now to read manga and organize your shit
[1:12:45] Burr11: yeah it's a harem show
[1:12:48] demon_dandy: You stopped disc watching elusive samurai right before my favorite cut ashton51Wah
[1:12:48] fatcacha: Some manga will never be adapted well like berserk or 20th century boys
[1:12:49] Burr11: but th emanga looks way better
[1:13:08] Burr11: yes!
[1:13:11] DavidPortnov: Not yet.
[1:13:12] Qrockpot: THE MONKEY MAN ANIME LMAOOOO
[1:13:15] demon_dandy: Oh my god ICANT
[1:13:15] eb0ss1: OH i need to see that
[1:13:20] Burr11: lmao it's hilarious though
[1:13:25] eb0ss1: aw man is it a bad adaptation?
[1:13:26] Burr11: i dont think it's that bad
[1:13:27] DavidPortnov: Comparison is the thief of joy.
[1:13:28] demon_dandy: Yeahhhh thats how i felt looking at it
[1:13:28] GManx0: I think it is silly to say that anime is less lovingly made, but it has a lot more pitfalls and the manga alredy has huge pitfalls in the creation of it
[1:13:30] Qrockpot: DARWIN IS SO GOOD
[1:13:36] Burr11: the OP is lit
[1:13:48] Burr11: dism
[1:13:50] InsaneLoke: i did
[1:13:56] Qrockpot: love the ape man
[1:14:04] pogotross: @GManx0 there's even more terrible manga than anime om
[1:14:06] Qrockpot: im a big planet of the apes enjoyer
[1:14:24] Qrockpot: @niertlwal tachiyomi my beloved
[1:14:31] niertlwal: oh they just released the AX badge price list
[1:14:33] niertlwal: it's not good
[1:14:35] niertlwal: lmao
[1:14:36] Burr11: are you watching Journal with Witch? that's an adaptation that's lovingly made
[1:14:46] demon_dandy: They did the spy family op i think kinda sucks
[1:14:47] InsaneLoke: 300
[1:14:48] niertlwal: 155 lmfao
[1:14:53] niertlwal: 4 days
[1:15:00] keternal: i think there's kind of this weird thing where "manga that get adapted into anime" tend to be better because they have to be like. selected but manga in general... who knows
[1:15:07] GManx0: @pogotross That is only cause anime cost more than making a manga.
[1:15:16] InsaneLoke: @niertlwal just like mag
[1:15:19] Qrockpot: thats not bad, a lot of stuff happens at anime expo
[1:15:23] DavidPortnov: That's not bad.
[1:15:26] maverickdrifter: oh mag is worth 155
[1:15:36] bonatide: I mean 4 days of consooming tho
[1:15:46] redactedenheim: I might go to AX this year, I have a lot of time on my hands now I'm done working
[1:15:48] GManx0: You need to get an agent
[1:15:51] Kitkattack: you didn't let anyone know about VV until like just before ashton51Omegalul
[1:15:55] niertlwal: idk i never thought AX was 155
[1:15:58] niertlwal: worth*
[1:16:17] maverickdrifter: i went for the first time this year and I'm still riding the high lol
[1:16:19] TheAsterite: mag is also 24/7 and thurs-sun
[1:16:20] Romblymo: But TwitchCon is worth 250 right guys
[1:16:27] jherchin12345: half the day will be lining up
[1:16:28] Qrockpot: AX was so fun last year, but I probably wont go again this year
[1:16:28] eb0ss1: KEKw
[1:16:29] niertlwal: twitchcon can kick rocks tho
[1:16:32] redactedenheim: hell no
[1:16:39] Burr11: fuck twichcon
[1:16:39] InsaneLoke: WHAT
[1:16:40] niertlwal: 24/7 magfest is an absolute steal for 155
[1:16:46] InsaneLoke: TWITCHCON IS 255....
[1:16:46] demon_dandy: ashtonPLEASE
[1:16:51] eb0ss1: i wonder if Bezos even knows about twitchcon
[1:16:56] GManx0: Anti Capitalist Streamer
[1:16:58] niertlwal: it's 24/7!!!!
[1:17:04] Burr11: they're ragebaiting the weeb
[1:17:15] redactedenheim: ax is freakin huge
[1:17:20] VoluXian: We're paying Dan Clancy too marimariSmug
[1:17:21] keternal: magfest is 155 now??
[1:17:22] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I will say, MAGFest did have a distinct lack of Ashton
[1:17:25] rikkaonline: at night? sleep ashton51Eep
[1:17:25] InsaneLoke: im broke as shit so no con is worth 155 so
[1:17:26] pogotross: but you can do that without paying
[1:17:27] niertlwal: you can do stuff at night OUTSIDE of AX which is different
[1:17:28] niertlwal: from magfest
[1:17:29] GManx0: Conventions are for people with friends
[1:17:32] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: But it did have Phoebe
[1:17:37] niertlwal: because magfest has things to do at night as part of the badge
[1:17:38] Burr11: what if i dont wanna be busy 24/7 ashton51Despair
[1:17:40] jherchin12345: it’s definitely a me problem cause I am a hermit that sleeps early
[1:17:44] fatcacha: ax was insane went back to the airbnb  4am every night
[1:17:49] bonatide: If an ani/chuuba fan could only go to 1 con in a year what would you say is best
[1:17:49] DavidPortnov: @Burr11  🤝
[1:17:55] Qrockpot: midnight mahjong was so lit...
[1:17:56] Romblymo: Ashton con is gonna go wild
[1:18:01] TheAsterite: lonestar colt went last year
[1:18:08] eb0ss1: vagfest (vtubers and gaming fest)
[1:18:09] jherchin12345: I’d pay 155 for Ashton con
[1:18:10] keternal: just turn it into vtubers and games festival. wait a second
[1:18:10] niertlwal: AX you can just go lobby it and not pay for a badge, you can't do that with mag
[1:18:11] niertlwal: lmao
[1:18:11] redactedenheim: AshCon?
[1:18:16] InsaneLoke: MAG has so much fucking anime. and there were so many vtuber fans. i can see it becoming a V-like con within the next few years
[1:18:23] rikkaonline: offkai
[1:18:28] pogotross: monkaS AshCon is one letter off from DashCon
[1:18:34] keternal: was it cheaper than 155 if you went in early or was it 155 from the start
[1:18:46] maverickdrifter: @InsaneLoke oh if they book a v-tuber group for a stage that'll go hard
[1:18:48] niertlwal: offkai needs a 24/7 venue
[1:18:52] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I mean, you could try asking to be in the next Idol Showcase, cause I know Dapplemii wants to do it again
[1:18:53] niertlwal: but san jose spooky at night
[1:18:55] Romblymo: OffKai is quite a nice community event, everyone likes to chat
[1:18:57] Qrockpot: Anime Expo is worth the pilgrimage everyone should go once
[1:19:08] eb0ss1: do NOT go to AX with inexperienced con goers its SO annoying
[1:19:09] redactedenheim: the 155 for AX is pennies on the amount of money that will be suctioned out of your wallet at AX tho
[1:19:21] Burr11: what if you want to see an ashton concert this year which con then ashton51Heyyy
