[1:48:37] nomzoogles: a loyal google soldier
[1:48:44] PSYCOMMUnist: the only valid use I can think of for chrome is RTX super resolution for shitty pirated anime
[1:48:51] JTBun: thats insane
[1:48:54] demon_dandy: This feels slanderous
[1:48:56] Burr11: i only ever used chrome because i used to play Kantai Collection and there was a chrome extension that had translations and kept track of important things in the game
[1:48:58] JTBun: microsoft is so bad now

[1:50:39] PSYCOMMUnist: thank you for the laughs Ashton my neighbor could probably hear me
[1:50:42] demon_dandy: The other drawing was in the back of the forest
[1:50:43] timinator193: the lantern bugs... gross...
[1:50:59] redactedenheim: this has so many more pixels than the last time I played Riven
[1:51:17] Senoquese: i cant believe i publicly defended windows 11 just for every single update after that to completely break a core feature

[1:52:26] timinator193: Oh maybe you need to bring something to that cave to see the full picture? ashton51Thinky ashton51Thinky ashton51Thinky
[1:52:26] JTBun: windows 11 is going downhill fast due to them replacing devs with AI
[1:52:36] Kitkattack: I haven't had much issues with 11 but I believe all that stuff from other people about updates breaking stuff
[1:53:03] outrunthewind: I think Microsoft said that something like 30% of their code is vibecoded now
[1:53:09] pogotross: yeah but you have $5000 worth of ram
[1:53:13] PSYCOMMUnist: I'm not invested like a linux nerd I just enjoy teasing you to laugh out of affection

[1:53:52] PSYCOMMUnist: I think having 64GB of RAM is awesome, they just aren't addicted to tabs enough if they don't get it

[2:00:38] outrunthewind: Maybe there are people EVERYWHERE
[2:00:52] timinator193: ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi
[2:01:01] PSYCOMMUnist: these look so uncomfortable to get into
[2:01:20] Max_Blanck: Ashton, have you played Myst, I wonder? Because this thing here was its direct sequel. I played both on release (Myst in 1993, Riven in 1997), and boy oh boy, they looked VERY differently LUL
[2:01:30] Senoquese: https://www.twitch.tv/ashtonmarten/clip/ImportantEnchantingCookieKevinTurtle-HvtZkQY8lK18p8f7
[2:01:34] timinator193: to stabilize the ribbon just put it on a cute vtuber ashton51Heyyy
[2:02:12] Senoquese: when the tuber scrum i gota say, i spoked 💔
[2:02:17] timinator193: that def felt like an easter egg
[2:02:22] Max_Blanck: It's so, so weird to see the graphics of this one. I remember the 1997 original, and it was nothing like this :D
[2:02:27] PSYCOMMUnist: the buildings
[2:02:45] PSYCOMMUnist: you'd have to like crawl on the ground
[2:02:46] MostPerfectPenguin: henlo pit crew. time to lurk before bed
[2:02:56] Senoquese: besides half life alyx this is probably the most gorgeous game ive ever seen ngl
[2:03:08] timinator193: Wow its a tree
[2:03:12] timinator193: lol
[2:03:17] Arafist: ITS A GOOMBA
[2:03:18] demon_dandy: Oh like the scarab?
[2:03:24] Senoquese: ahhh screen space reflections Classic
[2:03:30] Max_Blanck: Oh, don't get me wrong, the remake looks phenomenal. It's just so strange that it's not an FMV pre-render, but a real-time 3D.
[2:03:39] JTBun: go my scarab
[2:03:53] PSYCOMMUnist: you know what's really crazy? the bump mapping it looks wild in VR
[2:04:06] Senoquese: its a bug in the way thats kinda just how modern reflections work, and raytracting was the solution to that
[2:04:15] demon_dandy: @max_blanck when she played myst we got her to change the cutscenes to the fmvs and it was so fun ashton51Tehe
[2:04:15] Senoquese: before it turned into every game having useless raytracing
[2:04:32] Max_Blanck: @demon_dandy Oh, that's an option? That's so cool!
[2:04:50] timinator193: this game has bugs, trees and one ribbon
[2:04:52] Kitkattack: if only the growing pains for ray tracing was over already
[2:05:19] Senoquese: this game does have raytracing and im almost sure her pc can tank it given shes not streaming with it anymore
[2:05:32] demon_dandy: I dunno about riven but i was talkin about how you did that on myst
[2:05:44] PSYCOMMUnist: the growing pains for raytracing will be AI datacenters taking all the RAM needed to render it for next gen
[2:05:50] Max_Blanck: I also wonder how close are the puzzles to the original, because in 1997 I had 2 or 3 notebooks - 96 pages each - scribbled fully with my own notes. It was brutal.
[2:06:27] Kitkattack: the era of the fake frame generation ashton51Despair
[2:06:36] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[2:07:05] Max_Blanck: Last time a game made me do it was FEZ.
[2:07:15] timinator193: Oh yeah the cheating tool
[2:07:24] Max_Blanck: And Tunic.
[2:07:27] Kitkattack: naw you just had to raw dog the puzzles
[2:07:43] demon_dandy: I had so many pages for blue prince
[2:07:50] Senoquese: that was kinda what happened i dont think there were any riven experts at the start
[2:08:15] timinator193: when is the raw dogging puzzle?
[2:08:38] redactedenheim: I prefer my dog cooked
[2:08:40] demon_dandy: It was probably less conspicuous of a rock when it was a flat static backdrop
[2:09:26] Max_Blanck: Oh yeah, definitely Blue Prince too.
[2:09:51] timinator193: Oh thats bad
[2:10:07] demon_dandy: fuuuuck bad ending ashton51Despair
[2:10:48] timinator193: Imagine a puzzle game having bad endings lol
[2:11:10] demon_dandy: Technically myst did sorta
[2:11:17] timinator193: crazy
[2:11:32] Senoquese: looking at reviews, the lens is a new feature but puzzles were changed to accomodate how it works, so they feel "easier" but theyre actually harder than in the original game if you were to ditch the lens
[2:12:05] timinator193: the cheating lens concept was pretty funny to me
[2:12:26] timinator193: so come back later
[2:13:03] Senoquese: i think thats the case for some puzzles yeah
[2:13:28] Kitkattack: there was the drawing of the sea monster remember
[2:13:29] Senoquese: like some old puzzles can be done without the lens but theyre way harder, and some were made to be impossible without it
[2:13:31] Kitkattack: so that's 3
[2:13:33] timinator193: have you seen spider whick chronicles? Movie with a magical looking ring
[2:13:59] Kitkattack: damn realistic lens flare
[2:14:09] Burr11: that is pretty cool
[2:14:12] Burr11: if annoying
[2:14:39] Senoquese: probably a side effect of this being a vr game too LOL it was probably meant to fuck with you
[2:15:53] Senoquese: enabling raytracing and you just see ashton smiling reflecting on the glass the whole time
[2:16:00] gravymaybe: VoHiYo
[2:16:05] timinator193: ashton literally looking for the "writing on the wall"
[2:16:10] timinator193: in a puzzle game lol

[2:17:02] Burr11: the lens reminds me of the time you streamed with a magnifying glass on your face (the room stream?), and we spent like 20 minutes trying to fine tune the effect ashton51Tehe
[2:17:13] timinator193: ashton51Hi
[2:17:13] Senoquese: @Burr11 LMFAOOO that was so awesome

[2:19:59] GolfTermBirdie: peak referene
[2:20:02] Senoquese: playing this with your old headset would be a vom speedrun
[2:20:06] timinator193: Do you play vr streams ashton?

[4:51:14] olandgren: riven, a game about little guys who hurt you
[4:51:15] demon_dandy: Wait so whats the order were choosing
[4:51:32] Bird_toe: you definitely have a wrong picture
[4:51:35] Dust_Bin_Gaming: What do you have written down for the broken dial that's in the school/lab?
[4:52:01] timinator193: Aren't you looking at the wrong symbol? Like the symbol on the right is more important?
[4:52:13] TheAsterite: It might be worth counting up from 1 with the numbers on the right
[4:52:14] timinator193: it matches what is in the frogs
[4:52:29] Bird_toe: no, I double checked a walkthrough, one of the pictures is wrong
[4:53:03] Bird_toe: the uhh second one you were entering
[4:53:08] TheAsterite: Like figuring out how to count from 1 to 6
[4:53:15] Bird_toe: bug looking guy
[4:53:34] Qrockpot: yeah it was one of your bugs :u
[4:53:57] demon_dandy: The tree def looked like the scarab ashton51Wah
[4:54:23] Dust_Bin_Gaming: Which of those is #1?
[4:55:20] timinator193: You got this ashton ashton51Love
[4:55:44] Bird_toe: oh, yes. It is scarab, not weevil
[4:56:24] timinator193: Tbe intense music now lol
[4:57:20] demon_dandy: I cant count sorry ashton51Baby
[4:57:37] timinator193: I can't count in wingdings
[4:57:50] TheAsterite: Gotta learn to count in nuclear symbol
[4:57:58] timinator193: No you got this ashton51Love
[4:58:05] demon_dandy: OH
[4:58:15] Dust_Bin_Gaming: I don't think it'll help with the totem order on *this* puzzle, but the numbering seems to be a base of 3.  1-3 for the inside ring. Then 4-6 combines 1&2, 2&3, 3&1. 7 and up do the same but count both inside and outside together.
[4:58:20] TheAsterite: So what's 2
[4:58:27] InsaneLoke: 7
[4:58:36] TheAsterite: Ban loke
[4:58:48] InsaneLoke: ive never done anything wrong in my life
[4:58:59] timinator193: like bro how old are you
[4:59:20] TheAsterite: 2nd row is 1, yes
[4:59:24] Dust_Bin_Gaming: So that paper has 8, 1, 10, 5, 3, and 6 (going top to bottom)
[4:59:35] timinator193: 6 or 7?
[5:00:06] W_Artean: Cyan worlds and their insane number systems =D
[5:00:29] Dust_Bin_Gaming: For the totem puzzle, nothing, i think. It just helps you figure out the rest, so you can find the order of the totems by what they show.
[5:00:41] timinator193: yeah more stim
[5:01:12] Dust_Bin_Gaming: Yep
[5:01:20] Dust_Bin_Gaming: xD
[5:01:38] demon_dandy: CAUGHT
[5:01:43] W_Artean: And here it's just counting from 1 to 6 XD
[5:01:48] InsaneLoke: in english four eyes
[5:01:49] Bird_toe: ...or if you know those numbers, the only ones you don't know are 2 and 4. Only two options to brute force
[5:01:56] timinator193: ashton51Smile

[5:10:49] W_Artean: At one point in the 1997 Riven there was a little girl that appears out of nowhere in the jungle and runs away. She scared millions of players out of their seats.
