[1:10:07] rikkaonline: but yes mbti is also worthless
[1:10:13] Burr11: mbti is at least supposed to be based on how you are, astrology is just fuckin random based on birth
[1:10:26] katsuragi_kakeruvt: when its only FOR FUN its not on sight, but when they just don't talk to you or disregard something about you because of your "star sign" is when I have a problem
[1:10:26] CaptainJulibee: Yeah but being a hoe is a Sagittarius thing you cant hate them for it

[1:22:57] InsaneLoke: good question, many such cases
[1:22:58] RycegoZ: Tumblr refugees ruined Twitter cause of so much porn invading it

[1:24:30] RycegoZ: @InsaneLoke Yeah, the spread of the internet has definitely made niche interest more common
[1:24:31] T33bags: i get it i dont think everyone that has used 4chan is a bad person but there is a problem on the website that also cant be ignored
