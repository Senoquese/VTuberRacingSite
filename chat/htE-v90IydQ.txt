[1:07:47] CaptainJulibee: Talking like a real libra
[1:07:49] RycegoZ: Astrology is the female version of the Myers Briggs personality test, and we all know what those people are like
[1:07:53] yojamjam: people on dating apps can be pretty serious about it in particular
[1:07:54] rikkaonline: acting like it has ANY value is taking it too seriosuly
[1:08:07] InsaneLoke: its such a typical man thing to hate on astrology i feel
[1:08:12] rikkaonline: mbti is only descriptive at best
[1:08:15] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke ^
[1:08:23] Kitkattack: yeah pretty much any and all forms of astrology are stupid drivel

[1:10:05] cakeswindle: Not soon ashton51Cheer
[1:10:07] rikkaonline: but yes mbti is also worthless
[1:10:13] Burr11: mbti is at least supposed to be based on how you are, astrology is just fuckin random based on birth
[1:10:26] katsuragi_kakeruvt: when its only FOR FUN its not on sight, but when they just don't talk to you or disregard something about you because of your "star sign" is when I have a problem
[1:10:26] CaptainJulibee: Yeah but being a hoe is a Sagittarius thing you cant hate them for it
[1:10:28] tinysips: he's ran through but at least he's cool

[1:24:30] RycegoZ: @InsaneLoke Yeah, the spread of the internet has definitely made niche interest more common
[1:24:31] T33bags: i get it i dont think everyone that has used 4chan is a bad person but there is a problem on the website that also cant be ignored
