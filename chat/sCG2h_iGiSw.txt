[2:58:32] HmmHrmHarumph: redo it and do it RIGHT
[2:58:32] TheAsterite: the sounds just literally tell you which direction to go
[2:58:33] Ortintzki: The dink dinks?
[2:58:35] Senoquese: i refuse to believe theres an "intended" way to beat this
[2:58:37] demon_dandy: LOL
[2:58:37] KazooManEvan: Hi miss Ashton!
[2:58:37] megarittz: Here's the actual solution: There are like 4 different sound cues.
[2:58:44] TheAsterite: dink = north
[2:58:45] rikkaonline: each sound corresponds to a direction
[2:58:47] DatBoiVLC: GGs
[2:58:47] HmmHrmHarumph: the sounds are mapped to the cardinal directions
[2:58:49] Senoquese: omg
[2:58:50] TheAsterite: yep
[2:58:56] GigglePox: oh what the
[2:59:00] megarittz: One for north, one for south, one for east, one for west. the dink is not "better" than any of the rest
[2:59:03] demon_dandy: Thats why they overlap
[2:59:03] Bird_toe: The creators are on record stating that the tunnel puzzle is the only one they regret making.
[2:59:03] TheAsterite: 2 sounds meant northeast or something like that
[2:59:14] megarittz: There was a clue to the sound meanings earlier
[2:59:14] Senoquese: so the solution IS to bruteforce until you realize what each sound means
[2:59:20] Rhou_0: @Bird_toe Yeah, I can see why
[2:59:26] TheAsterite: i think most people brute forced this lol
[2:59:29] TheAsterite: ashton51Omega

[2:59:48] xianthippe: Yeah I didn't figure it until I was almost out
[3:00:02] TheAsterite: you should put a page in
[3:00:03] HmmHrmHarumph: I got near the end of the puzzle by the time I solved it
[3:00:07] TheAsterite: üìñ
[3:00:08] megarittz: Is it possible to figure out what the sounds mean *after* you get in the vehicle? IIRC the only clue is *before* getting in, earlier
[3:00:10] replex01: Whoa, you can carry both pages in the remaster !?
[3:00:12] Rhou_0: There was clues on the ambient hinting that?
[3:00:12] xianthippe: The book boys at it again
[3:00:12] megarittz: But I don't remember
[3:00:21] demon_dandy: honestly that puzzle probably give me low white blood cells under the wrong moon

[3:04:43] TheAsterite: putting live action fmv in a mac video game was what they specialized in at the time
[3:04:58] dax812: Did the plot have to do with building a big trantrack
[3:04:59] sirgimbal: Did you just accidently spoil it for yourself?

[4:59:45] W_Artean: You'll know more when playing Riven :D
[4:59:53] GManx0: This Game has a story and isnt just Puzzles?
[5:00:35] W_Artean: @GManx0 There is a lot of story (mostly told by journals and environment) and great lore.
[5:00:43] demon_dandy: There is definitely something gained in this bein remade, no diss to the og
[5:01:07] GManx0: Neat
[5:01:13] W_Artean: This particular Age got the "Riven" treatment. Not just a 1:1 remake, but they changed and added a lot of things.
[5:01:37] vera_azure: Wow, new puzzles in Myst? Hmm. bunayuNya
[5:02:12] GManx0: Her brain isnt mush just yet
[5:02:13] demon_dandy: What were the notes?
[5:02:16] Lord_Scrublet: this is the rest of our lives. we are all already trapped in myst limbo
[5:02:26] W_Artean: Rime wasn't in the OG 1993 Myst. It was added in the first 3D remake from 2000. But this version expands on it.
[5:02:32] TheAsterite: there's something to do here, but in realmyst it didn't take too long
[5:02:51] demon_dandy: LOL
[5:02:54] vera_azure: Yeah this colored device panel thingy was definitely not in the original. Is this a whole new zone, too, then?
[5:03:25] d3athdr4m: I recognize some of the puzzle
[5:03:46] vera_azure: Oh yeah this is new. I thought this was Stoneship at first, on account of the tunnels
[5:04:12] W_Artean: In RealMyst they also used this Age to tease some content for the upcoming Myst multiplayer game.

[5:04:32] vera_azure: Myst was practically a glorified Hypercard stack. Which is still part of the charm imo.
