[1:56:45] jherchin12345: 3g was fast a decade ago
[1:56:48] Burr11: yeah roaming is worthless
[1:56:50] niertlwal: its crazy cause you could've bought an esim even there
[1:56:57] TheAsterite: is your family american? sounds like american confidence
[1:57:02] JaAmfan: @rikkaonline this. 3g towers were decommissioned
[1:57:07] Burr11: yep you can do the esim there

[1:59:29] Kitkattack: dumbass cell network people
[1:59:29] jherchin12345: yeah the amount of time phone and isp companies lie too much to trust them
[1:59:34] ReyJaggy: wonder what esim she got, i was in the middle of mexico with no signal and bough an esim using some random restaurants wifi
[1:59:52] niertlwal: ubigi slaps
[1:59:56] Burr11: ubigi awesome
[1:59:57] phatscout: maybe sister marten didn't trust you because you're a weeb and thought "oh my weeb sister is probably wrong about actual useful info" and had to eat crow that she doubted her sister
[2:00:01] Kitkattack: You Biggie smalls
[2:00:12] jherchin12345: also isnt it common practice to tell your bank when you leave the country too?
[2:00:21] JaAmfan: Dealing with telecom on the enterprise aide is a nightmare too. We used [insert carrier here] for camera monitoring in remote areas and they will straight lie to you about coverage
[2:00:27] niertlwal: yeah but your bank will also try to send you texts

[2:01:19] yojamjam: too good for ryan reynolds damn
[2:01:25] Burr11: but its always low priority
[2:01:27] phatscout: you're on the second tier but at least in Rochester NY I don't have any issues with data tiering
[2:01:29] niertlwal: with deprioritized data

[2:02:12] sirmars1: Thank you Miss Ashton's  parents for having good phone service for Miss Ashton.
[2:02:13] merliwuv: Oh yea if you get a third party service you get lowest priority

[2:12:31] Burr11: lmaooo
[2:12:31] sirmars1: Great movie in the theaters. because of the visuals. Not my favorite movie all together though.
[2:12:35] Burr11: it was the planes fault!!
[2:12:37] JTBun: its okay
[2:12:39] rikkaonline: i thought it was ok
[2:12:41] Kitkattack: it's not a very normal movie
[2:12:45] JaAmfan: Its ok, I don't like it either lol
[2:12:46] niertlwal: yeah cause it slapped on IMAX
[2:12:46] phatscout: I honestly think it's pretty good but a lot of people think it's pretty below mid
[2:12:46] Navy_Mongoose: my friend got in hot water for thinking the same thing ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[2:12:48] niertlwal: lmfao
[2:12:59] c_v_catullus16: There are a lot of plot holes in Interstellar. It's a bit like Raiders of the Lost Ark in that regard.
[2:13:07] phatscout: BRAVO NOLAN I LOVE YOU
[2:13:09] JaAmfan: It's kind of pedestrian sci-fi
[2:13:10] niertlwal: watching it on IMAX was pretty crazy
[2:13:26] yojamjam: it's sappyyyyyyy
[2:13:28] sirmars1: Gotta say, it did make me feel a little clostraphobic.
[2:13:39] Burr11: i def agree it's overrated
[2:13:42] niertlwal: no time for caution was a good bit
[2:13:45] c_v_catullus16: Tessaract?
[2:13:47] EmkaZRC: Go for it
[2:13:49] Senoquese: i didnt watch it ashton51Bork
[2:13:54] InsaneLoke: everyone knows the black hole part
[2:13:54] merliwuv: Interstellar is one of my less favorite nolan films but he made so many other amazing movies
[2:14:03] EmkaZRC: That was my problem with it too
[2:14:12] rikkaonline: they at least got how a black hole looks basically right
[2:14:24] JaAmfan: Gunbuster clears ngl
[2:14:26] c_v_catullus16: A grandfather paradox
[2:14:43] yojamjam: it presents some interesting stuff then uses it in such an aw shucks way
[2:14:47] Kitkattack: they are cool designs
[2:14:48] niertlwal: the black hole part was supposedly assisted by some theoretical physicists i think
[2:15:01] demon_dandy: Oh yeahhhh ninoegICANT
[2:15:04] niertlwal: kip thorne was his name
[2:15:25] EmkaZRC: The end was super cheesy I agree
[2:15:31] c_v_catullus16: THe tessaract box?
[2:15:32] Navy_Mongoose: the black hole from zathura was better classic
[2:15:47] phatscout: Tenet is kinda bad straight up
[2:15:50] phatscout: I know it has it's shooters
[2:15:50] ReyJaggy: oh youre going to hate tenet lol
[2:15:54] Kitkattack: oh jesus not Zathura FailFish
[2:15:59] c_v_catullus16: If you watch Tenet, make sure you watch it with subtitles.
[2:16:07] Burr11: tenet sucks ass
[2:16:11] EmkaZRC: Prestige is my fav Nolan from the ones I watched.
[2:16:13] niertlwal: anyway i think you should rewatch it maybe in IMAX cause that would've been probably the best
[2:16:16] demon_dandy: Tenet is fun ashton51Tehe
[2:16:17] phatscout: I think half the reason people glaze the fuck out of Oppenheimer is that it was the comeback from Tenet being ass
[2:16:18] Navy_Mongoose: Tenet is peak Christopher Nolan, which can go both ways depending on how much of a Nolan fan you are
[2:16:22] niertlwal: it was a lot of eyecandy
[2:16:29] Kitkattack: Zathura is like funny kids scifi
[2:16:48] c_v_catullus16: Tenet is hard to follow. You need to watch it more than once.
[2:16:52] merliwuv: i really loved dark knight and memento and inception
[2:16:59] RNGCannon: I can't stand the sound mixing in Nolan films
[2:17:20] Navy_Mongoose: kind of, it's very cheesy, and it's katsu's favorite movie of all time
[2:17:21] Senoquese: we're gonna have to watch this vod more than once too to understand the trip
[2:17:22] djravingdragon: Oppenheimer is good if you like science drama
[2:17:34] JTBun: @Senoquese LMAO
[2:17:35] scubapuma: you can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt like interstellar you didn‚Äôt watch it right!!! you didn‚Äôt watch it In a theater you watched the best visuals on an iPhone size screen!!!!!

[2:18:08] Kitkattack: just how Christopher nolan intended ashton51Kneel
[2:18:11] niertlwal: i mean its supposed to be an experience to a degree
