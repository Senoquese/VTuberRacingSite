[0:13:32] Senoquese: yeah i would still enjoy you playing a game locked in like that because its rare you get to play a game you can get seriously good at, its really awesome to see you in your zone
[0:13:56] PSYCOMMUnist: I wonder how many times my neighbor has heard me rage "hiding behind a building" when I get pissed I have passive teammates using me as a puppet

[0:15:48] Donkler57: Playing overwatch for years as tempered my spirit and nothing can enrage me anymore
[0:16:08] PSYCOMMUnist: If you push the objective and people stand back and camp basically

[0:17:06] JTBun: its not
[0:17:11] demon_dandy: if you just get into the game maybe
[0:17:11] JTBun: you will
[0:17:13] redactedenheim: no idea
[0:17:17] rikkaonline: go for it
[0:17:17] Enzic1: deadlock stream pivot
[0:17:18] Senoquese: youll have to do multiple streams anyways, might as well start now
[0:17:19] ArthurWar: You should
[0:17:29] PSYCOMMUnist: I booted the GBA ROM once but I didn't play so much as checked it worked and watch the intro
[0:17:30] demon_dandy: Honestly might as well work through the intro
[0:17:36] DoctorDreads: Streamer's choice
[0:17:41] PSYCOMMUnist: Because we were worried Nintendo would take it down
[0:18:02] Senoquese: LOL
[0:18:03] rikkaonline: i cleaned them before i sent them to you
[0:18:05] PSYCOMMUnist: It's also because it's small and you need a lot of grip force
[0:18:07] rikkaonline: internally
[0:18:08] DoctorDreads: Oh from Castlevania
[0:18:10] redactedenheim: nah, they sucked when they were brand new
[0:18:11] PSYCOMMUnist: Using big controllers is much easier for adult hands
[0:18:29] rikkaonline: im partway through it
[0:18:50] Senoquese: did you get jtbs emulator setup for this downloaded? she was like wow is this how you feel when you send ashton games

[0:18:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: petit chilla paws
[0:18:55] PSYCOMMUnist: Nah NES buttons in the 90s were very low activation force
[0:18:58] PSYCOMMUnist: That might just be age
[0:19:08] Senoquese: LOL
[0:19:08] JTBun: omg
[0:19:09] rikkaonline: ashton51Omegalul
[0:19:10] JTBun: lmao
[0:19:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you might need to clean the contacts
[0:19:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: oranSpin retroarc!
[0:19:44] yojamjam: nes dpad is on the stiff end
[0:19:55] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I hope they cleaned both contacts and the membranes
[0:20:03] Senoquese: do you fw retroarch? you were scared of the ui last stream ashton51Tehe i think jtb sent a different one
[0:20:07] PSYCOMMUnist: the d-pad yeah I suppose, just not the a/b buttons
[0:20:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah brick NES controller is not ergo
[0:20:11] rikkaonline: @mrp0p1nfr3sh complete disassembly
[0:20:17] demon_dandy: When i was a kid i thought the halo thing came from dragon ball LOL
[0:20:25] timinator193: @demon_dandy ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[0:20:31] Senoquese: LOL
[0:20:33] rikkaonline: lol
[0:20:35] JTBun: did the mods set you up with mGBA on retroarch?
[0:20:37] PSYCOMMUnist: SNES controller d-pad is a bit smooshier and softer
[0:20:40] ArthurWar: LOL
[0:20:43] JTBun: if not you need to play on mGBA
[0:20:45] demon_dandy: Yeah LMAO thats where i first saw it ashton51Omegalul
[0:20:50] yojamjam: yes mgba
[0:20:53] F1nalStarman: ashton51Thinky
[0:21:19] Senoquese: if its the same game rom file then the only difference is the ui i suppose
[0:21:19] JTBun: well do you have the translation?
[0:21:29] yojamjam: i sent patched rom
[0:21:34] JTBun: no
[0:21:40] ArthurWar: We never got it in the west
[0:21:41] rikkaonline: rofl mother 3 was never released here
[0:21:43] TheAsterite: It was famously never translated
[0:21:45] demon_dandy: It never got a proper tl
[0:21:45] JTBun: its never been publuished outside of japan
[0:21:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah its in japanese not english
[0:21:51] F1nalStarman: Mother 3 is infamously NEVER released outside Japan
[0:21:53] TheAsterite: ashton51ICANT
[0:22:03] Senoquese: it seems both people sent you the exact same patched version its just a matter of what emulator's ui youd fuck with the most ashton51Tehe
[0:22:05] rikkaonline: the licensing for all the references and samples would be impossible
[0:22:07] PSYCOMMUnist: It's the cool kid's JRPG
[0:22:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: there is a modern release In english but its a bootleg that got put on cartridges
[0:22:11] ArthurWar: I think there's a whole book on the story of this game and its unofficial translation
[0:22:20] ReyJaggy: prequel to undertale
[0:22:39] ReyJaggy: !dance
[0:22:43] JTBun: its a GBA game anyway
[0:22:46] JTBun: so
[0:22:55] Senoquese: source games use .sav for the save games
[0:23:00] PSYCOMMUnist: For GBA there's really amazing filters that make it dead on like a real one, but I know no one cares for those
[0:23:02] PSYCOMMUnist: In Retroarch
[0:23:04] timinator193: @ReyJaggy I wonder if she would like games like undertale or deltarune ashton51Thinky
[0:23:12] redactedenheim: ]windows file associations are weird
[0:23:12] timinator193: I /j
[0:23:27] yojamjam: @PSYCOMMUnist have you seen the new hotness pixel-transparency i'm obsessed
[0:23:29] InsaneLoke: mothering three
[0:23:37] F1nalStarman: A team of Earthbound fans spent several years translating the game to English and developing a patch for it. It is only thanks to their hard work that Mother 3 is a beloved game outside of Japan.
[0:23:40] JTBun: you might have to fuck with the audio settings in the emulator
[0:24:04] Senoquese: @yojamjam oh that looks sick
[0:24:08] JTBun: like 2010s
[0:24:29] JTBun: Mother 3 released really late into the GBAs life
[0:24:51] buruhas: I remember when Brawl came out and Mother 3 had alot of representation in-game and the game wasn't even available outside JP ashton51Pathetic
[0:24:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: mother 3 was patched back in the late 2000s but a good patch wasnt done till 2010s
[0:24:52] F1nalStarman: Game released in japan in 2006. Fans started working on translation immediately, and the first version of the patch was done in Oct 2008
[0:25:10] demon_dandy: Gba games are so beautiful
[0:25:18] yojamjam: oh this would be a cool spot for pixel ashton
[0:25:24] demon_dandy: Oh true
[0:25:30] Senoquese: i think smash had animal crossing representation before any of the games were out in the west
[0:25:49] theSimplechild: Add Fire Emblem to that list too
[0:25:51] VeliusReinhardt: chacha88Cutiepies chacha88Cutiepies chacha88Cutiepies
[0:25:51] yojamjam: Clueless
[0:25:51] InsaneLoke: LOL
[0:25:56] PSYCOMMUnist: Basically for GBA games the intended look is to have super tiny little black boxes around each pixel that filters add back in
[0:25:58] demon_dandy: Its like how ness and even FE were like who tf is this
[0:26:01] PSYCOMMUnist: It looks way better with it
[0:26:06] MelvinSoupreme: i've heard the fan translation is really good for mother 3
[0:26:16] F1nalStarman: Smash Bros brawl even had spoilers for the end of Mother 3 in it. That REALLY pissed off western fans because Brawl came out before the patch did
[0:26:21] Senoquese: its crazy you arent crying already just thinking of playing it
[0:26:24] Senoquese: its that good
[0:26:31] redactedenheim: I'd rather the game make me cry than the controler
[0:26:41] TheAsterite: It's a jrpg, it'll be a little long
[0:26:51] F1nalStarman: Mother 3 is about 25 hours long on average
[0:27:05] olandgren: the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
[0:27:16] Senoquese: are you gonna 100% it or are you doing the fastest any% run like omori Classic
[0:27:16] TheAsterite: 12 ashton51Shy
[0:27:39] Senoquese: ashton51Omegalul
[0:27:54] JTBun: its not that hard
[0:27:57] JTBun: come on
[0:28:07] demon_dandy: Its like super mario rpg ashton51Tehe
[0:28:19] JTBun: there are some hard boss fights
[0:28:21] TheAsterite: It's harder than castlevania
[0:28:23] JTBun: but thats about it
[0:28:34] rikkaonline: Life
[0:28:35] Senoquese: wow thats actually fucking deep
[0:28:39] JTBun: some of the hardest fights are optional
[0:28:41] JTBun: so
[0:28:43] F1nalStarman: ashton51Nodders
[0:28:49] demon_dandy: I like the quote the best way to eat a whale is one piece at a time
[0:28:51] PSYCOMMUnist: I mean there's no physical execution
[0:28:55] PSYCOMMUnist: Hard JRPG fights are just planning
[0:29:12] MelvinSoupreme: yummers
[0:29:17] JTBun: one piece? like the anime
[0:29:27] demon_dandy: Its grotesqueness kinda feels more inspiring to me
[0:29:31] TheAsterite: But can you eat a whale before it goes rotten? ashton51Thinky
[0:29:44] demon_dandy: ashtonPLEASE
[0:29:45] Senoquese: oneguyd

[0:29:58] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[0:30:02] rikkaonline: lol
[0:30:06] PSYCOMMUnist: Sometimes you are like if psychicpebbles was a beautiful nerdy girl lol
[0:30:11] JTBun: there is rhythm elements to Mother 3 too btw
[0:30:13] Senoquese: also hamsterball and snail mail some of the tuffest jrpgs, i think youve got this
[0:30:34] redactedenheim: you sound like Alice from the Honeymooners, now THAT would age you
[0:30:37] InsaneLoke: i dont think ur at all like zach hadel LMFAO
[0:30:38] diegojgl93: sounds very millennial
[0:30:49] Senoquese: twoguyd
[0:31:03] Senoquese: guy who has only watched smiling friends
[0:31:08] PSYCOMMUnist: the pitcrew chillas are like your own personal little green witches
[0:31:11] The_Great_Moof: hello pit crew, hi Ashton
[0:31:17] hooplahound: @Senoquese +2
[0:31:18] JTBun: yes
[0:31:26] JTBun: or when you wake up
[0:31:38] F1nalStarman: Yes, there is a rhythm-based mechanic in the combat. The other major quirk that sets the game apart from other JRPGs is the use of a "rolling" HP bar. Tough to explain, you'll know what I mean once you start playing.
[0:31:44] Senoquese: holy shit animation vs animator was my SHITTTT
[0:31:53] PSYCOMMUnist: I've been following zach for like 10+ years long before Smiling friends lol
[0:31:59] diegojgl93: guys beware of the ashtonplasmosis

[0:34:34] JTBun: a little
[0:34:40] InsaneLoke: how is this surprising
[0:34:43] The_Great_Moof: Ashton somehow has the deep internet knowledge of a 45-year-old shut-in.
[0:34:49] InsaneLoke: LOL
[0:34:57] redactedenheim: its better than pretendtious
[0:34:58] Senoquese: laughing so hard at this i sound like a chilla squeaking
[0:35:00] deafmutelaughing: pretentious means you pretend to be smart when you aren't
[0:35:07] InsaneLoke: you are such a princess LMFAO
[0:35:18] Donkler57: 35 minutes into stream still on the starting screen lmao
[0:35:24] redactedenheim: does she stream?
[0:35:25] HelmetBoyR: way to diss your sister.
[0:35:25] fatcacha: she should try btubing
[0:35:25] JTBun: oh we know
[0:35:27] demon_dandy: Its gonna be so interesting ICANT
[0:35:30] Senoquese: every stream you claim some absurdly outlandish shit with 100% confidence and its simply not true
[0:35:31] fatcacha: vtubing*
[0:35:38] PSYCOMMUnist: Your sister complimented my name and likes Zeta and ZZ so she will always be cool with me
[0:35:42] The_Great_Moof: you aren't pretentious. i worked with an audio engineer at prev job who only watched obscure European movies.

[0:36:29] The_Great_Moof: i watched Jean Cocqteau cuz of this guy
[0:36:34] rikkaonline: mandela affect is the pretentious rejection of reality
[0:36:36] F1nalStarman: Ashton is not pretentious. She was very nice to us while looking at the anime 3x3s when she could have completely roasted us instead.
[0:36:40] PSYCOMMUnist: I want to hear your sister's obscure anime takes
[0:36:49] The_Great_Moof: oh. we'd probably get along great, i love weirdos with odd hyperfixations.
[0:36:53] Senoquese: why ashton51ICANT

[1:45:17] spikebomb5: theyre great as a kid. the romance is just teen angst
[1:45:22] Navy_Mongoose: "George Lucas 100% Understands Women"
[1:45:24] Paperguide: hmm
[1:45:24] F1nalStarman: That's because George Lucas is bad at character writing om
[1:45:27] The_Great_Moof: yeah the chemistry between Anakin & Padme is "explosive" like thermite or those Tiktok ladies who accidentally make napalm
[1:45:41] Senoquese: yesss
[1:45:43] Wur_Q: I think anakin is kinda off bros he may be a bit evil
[1:45:47] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, the romance is fucking terrible and nobody knows what was happening there
[1:45:50] InsaneLoke: Ash we gotta finish the prequels
[1:45:55] fatcacha: its wasnt romantic to me at all padme and anakin felt forced and anakin was just selfish
[1:46:01] Navy_Mongoose: YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED EPISODE 3 YET?!
[1:46:04] pantalaimon91: Lucas can't write romance. It's bad in the original trilogy, it's bad in the prequels. He's bad at directing it too.
[1:46:09] InsaneLoke: @Navy_Mongoose yes
[1:46:17] spikebomb5: it's done better in the cartoons
[1:46:20] F1nalStarman: She hasn't seen Episode 3? WHAT?!?

[1:47:19] ajvark: @pantalaimon91 legit i think lucas is AroAce
[1:47:24] spikebomb5: u do have to remember that while it wasnt banned, having a relationship was highly discouraged among jedi. the council literally decided to not promote him for years cuz of it.
[1:47:26] ajvark: even though he's married
[1:47:34] The_Great_Moof: Anakin has big abusive ex-bf energy
[1:47:36] fatcacha: my sister used to have a fan tribute site for anakin
[1:47:36] Navy_Mongoose: Padme constantly taunts Anakin and never puts out until he reveals he killed a bunch of women and children
[1:47:37] wubbadubdub69: It wasn't the most well written to be fair
[1:47:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: that was the point

[1:51:58] spikebomb5: watch as they put a sacrificing yoshis to jump farther joke
[1:52:11] Senoquese: worst part is that in super mario world hes like whipping and slapping yoshi so itd be weird if hes sentient and just a guy through all that
[1:52:12] ArthurWar: He isn't voiced by his usual VA, but they didn't name any celebrities in the direct either
[1:52:18] ajvark: @spikebomb5 he'd use his tongue to grapple onto something
[1:52:20] fatcacha: no
[1:52:23] Burr11: not really...
[1:52:24] GolfTermBirdie: idk
[1:52:24] spikebomb5: meh

[1:52:25] F1nalStarman: @GolfTermBirdie Epic Universe rendition of Yoshi's Island music is so good
[1:52:30] InsaneLoke: mario got fans
[1:52:35] Navy_Mongoose: not really, I've never played Mother 3 but I hear its the best
[1:52:37] demon_dandy: I mean its a mario movie, kids probably stoked
[1:52:38] fatcacha: i’ll watch it on netflix
[1:52:42] ajvark: ill probably wait for someone to upload it to twitter
[1:52:44] yojamjam: first one was so bad idc
[1:52:44] Senoquese: it seems harmless
[1:52:46] JTBun: eh
[1:52:46] Burr11: i'll watch it on streaming
[1:52:47] ajvark: like they did with the first mario movie
[1:52:48] F1nalStarman: I saw Mario 1 on pre-release night, and I'll probably do the same for this one.
[1:52:51] spikebomb5: i preferred the 90s mario actually
[1:52:54] rikkaonline: i still havent seen the first one, 1993 smb was all i needed
[1:52:57] GolfTermBirdie: ill watch in but only JP dub cause im that guy
[1:53:02] demon_dandy: ashton51Durr
[1:53:03] Navy_Mongoose: oh you mean Mario, not really either
[1:53:04] a_raccoon27: i still havent seen the first one yet
[1:53:07] InsaneLoke: i like the production team at illumination, but im not really excited for the movie itself
[1:53:08] Paperguide: Modern writers are hacks
[1:53:11] The_Great_Moof: ashton51Despair ashton51Despair
[1:53:11] Burr11: she should've been more "Focus, M"
[1:53:17] Navy_Mongoose: the 1991 Mario Movie is the only good one
[1:53:18] fatcacha: they made her a boss girl and she’s supposed to be saved most of the time
[1:53:24] fatcacha: @Navy_Mongoose this
[1:53:36] Navy_Mongoose: we need to Discord Movie Night that
[1:53:37] ajvark: i still want the DK Solo movie
[1:53:38] GolfTermBirdie: guys please the 1991 movie is very mid too
[1:53:41] ArthurWar: I'm still kinda mad they overwrote a lot of the movie's score with whatever the producers heard on the radio and said "yeah, that, put that in the movie"
[1:53:42] GolfTermBirdie: ARMLESS???
[1:53:46] spikebomb5: yoshis have arms....
[1:53:49] Burr11: armless is freakier
[1:53:51] Navy_Mongoose: Live Action Yoshi was in that too
[1:53:56] ajvark: DK Solo movie with big sad cranky deathbed scene
[1:53:57] fatcacha: poor yoshi…
[1:54:05] The_Great_Moof: "Hey Yoshi what that tongue do"
[1:54:09] GolfTermBirdie: no arms just hands
[1:54:17] Senoquese: yeah harmless is how i feel about it
[1:54:19] demon_dandy: @ajvark Look into this.. ashton51Tensai
[1:54:20] F1nalStarman: @ArthurWar This is fair. Koji Kondo doesn't need pop music in his score.
[1:54:21] drender200: YYum
[1:54:35] GolfTermBirdie: rosalina is gonna be in this one...
[1:54:36] ArthurWar: I'm more interested in them bringing back characters like Mouser, like why is he there
[1:54:53] Senoquese: hes a boss in mario 2
[1:54:56] GolfTermBirdie: was i crazy or did they announce new voice actors
[1:54:57] Senoquese: and never apppeared again iirc
[1:54:59] Navy_Mongoose: Mario 2 boss
[1:55:04] GolfTermBirdie: geno will NEVER be in these movies
[1:55:14] InsaneLoke: mauser is an iconic mario character
[1:55:15] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:55:17] Navy_Mongoose: because it was a dream
[1:55:19] ajvark: doki doki panic is the real mario 2 anyways
[1:55:20] InsaneLoke: he was in the cartoon
[1:55:21] ArthurWar: Birdo was also from that game, so it seems like there might be some SMB2 subplot
[1:55:26] ajvark: subcon casino
[1:55:27] GolfTermBirdie: YOU CANT SAY THAT
[1:55:29] demon_dandy: New geno believers dream in 2026...
[1:55:35] InsaneLoke: mauser has more presence in the series than Geno unironically
[1:55:35] F1nalStarman: Yeah good luck getting the rights for Geno from Square Enix lol
[1:55:39] CandleEOC: Geno showing up is less likely than Sony making a Bloodborne Sequel
[1:55:41] a_raccoon27: my uncle works at nintendo and said geno is dead in this universe
[1:55:41] ajvark: bob-ombs came from mario 2
[1:55:44] buruhas: Geno for the Smash Bros movie ashton51Cope
[1:56:03] Senoquese: i hate how they are naming the movies after the games like good luck googling "mario galaxy yoshi" from now on
[1:56:04] ArthurWar: They'd still need special perms from Square, not sure how likely that'd be
[1:56:09] fatcacha: geno died for our sin
[1:56:17] GolfTermBirdie: i put my entire LIFE on geno not showing up
[1:56:24] JTBun: yessss

[1:59:11] F1nalStarman: Mother = Earthbound Beginnings, Mother 2 = Earthbound, Mother 3 = Never released ashton51Despair
[1:59:15] ArthurWar: Mother 1 was another game we didn't get in the west until 2015 on the Wii U
[1:59:17] Senoquese: you want me to edit your 3d model to have like wrinkles so mama marten can use it for her tracking during karaoke

[1:59:37] Senoquese: mother 1 isnt really that important
[1:59:39] Burr11: yeah ashton why you starting with mother 3
[1:59:39] yojamjam: everybody skips mother 1
[1:59:42] GolfTermBirdie: its super OLD
[1:59:42] Navy_Mongoose: Because Mother 1 was JP only so nobody here played it
[1:59:52] F1nalStarman: Mother 1 is an NES RPG, and it's a rough time
[1:59:54] GolfTermBirdie: i mean it kinda is important
[1:59:58] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I can enjoy Earthbound Beginnings, but none of the games are really that connected in general.
[2:00:02] xKiv: it's like the first 6 final fantasies, american numbering is crooked because they didn't even release some of the games over there
[2:00:07] GManx0: Mother 1 is the Castelvania 1
[2:00:07] Navy_Mongoose: Mother 3 was also JP only iirc
[2:00:08] ArthurWar: Earthbound Beginnings was JP only until 2015
[2:00:09] fatcacha: people play the series in different orders and get different experiences
[2:00:11] rikkaonline: its the meme game
[2:00:12] Senoquese: you can start with either mother 2 or 3 either one goes and is up to you
[2:00:24] JTBun: Mother 3 is the best of the series, and i will die on this hill
[2:00:27] GolfTermBirdie: there IS one sequence that is super earthbound related but youll get it
[2:00:36] GolfTermBirdie: earthbound
[2:00:44] Senoquese: LOL
[2:00:46] Navy_Mongoose: doesn't really matter, they're turn-based RPGs
[2:00:47] pogotross: RPGs on the NES are really, really rough
[2:00:58] Burr11: why didn't you start with pong? smh
[2:00:59] fatcacha: some play 3,1,2 or 2,1,3, etc each experience is different
