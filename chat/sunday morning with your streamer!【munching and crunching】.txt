[3:22:01] Returner7: @demon_dandy yeah it's weird because 'Sleep' and "I'm Only Sleeping" are games, but it seems people use "I'm Only Sleeping" for sleep streams

[3:22:38] AshtonMarten: i can’t even end it from my phone…
[3:23:00] Returner7: lol we
[3:23:17] ChessCatUWU: I think it's because streaming doesn't come from Twitch, it comes from whatever streaming software you're usuing.
