[0:49:30] GManx0: She is still sensitive to cringe
[0:49:32] Deepfreeze2k: There is a balance.
[0:49:53] redactedenheim: @Deepfreeze2k you went to college with William Shatner?

[0:52:27] Kitkattack: Ashton could never have a bit
[0:52:27] phatscout: cringe can be earnest and almost insincere
[0:52:43] phatscout: cringe is like a perpendicular axis to that's stuff

[0:53:22] ajvark: sorry if i offended someone
[0:53:28] DavidPortnov: Well, that is true.
[0:53:31] Deepfreeze2k: We have some pretty good local productions where I'm at, so I havent seen any cringe productions since high school.
[0:53:33] phatscout: 00s anime dubs sound "like that" because most of those people came out of local Dallas Fort-Worth area theater

[0:53:53] ajvark: @DatBoiVLC idk he'd find it funny
[0:53:59] Kitkattack: I love the jack of all trades over confidence om

[0:54:01] muyoEishi: Try voice acting first
[0:54:09] thenames_tito: ashton51Wave
[0:54:12] phatscout: 00s anime dubs sound "like that" because most of those people came out of local Dallas Fort-Worth area theater which is why theater acting sounds like MHA tiktokers
[0:54:12] T33bags: T33bags subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! hi Ashton

[0:54:48] Deepfreeze2k: Then again one of my best buds in middle school is a pretty solid actor, and most of the productions I've seen since high school he's been in.
[0:54:52] redactedenheim: unless you're a brain surgeon or a jet pilot
[0:54:54] a_raccoon27: does the vtuber mask help you avoid feeling cringe on stream?
[0:54:56] phatscout: idk if it was limiting your life you wouldn't have done like 2/3 of the bits you've done as a chuuba

[0:55:23] DatBoiVLC: the OR playlists are nutty
[0:55:30] T33bags: I think Ashton is a child at heart in that she is evil without knowing how evil she is
[0:55:33] phatscout: 00s anime dubs sound "like that" because most of those people came out of local Dallas Fort-Worth area theater which is why theater acting sounds like MHA tiktokers
[0:55:45] DavidPortnov: Surgeons have the best dark humor.

[2:33:52] Navy_Mongoose: star fox has some cool feet facts
[2:33:54] yojamjam: cloaca
[2:33:58] Redamaford: A roller skate is not a clanker.
[2:34:07] PSYCOMMUnist: What??? Falco's way tougher than Fox.
[2:34:08] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[2:34:09] DatBoiVLC: @yojamjam HahaThink
[2:34:10] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Falco and starfux  its not hate, it's sexual tension
[2:34:17] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: @DatBoiVLC Are you talking about the amputation to combat Gforce rumor? That's been disproven multiple times?
[2:34:20] HmmHrmHarumph: if you score above 1500 you get a graphic Fox X Falco ending screen
[2:34:21] PSYCOMMUnist: Dead wrong.
[2:34:22] HiddenFlare91: Watch along with Naughty Scene?

[2:36:06] Navy_Mongoose: you thought Slippy was a girl at first
[2:36:07] Red__2: bnuny
[2:36:09] PSYCOMMUnist: You literally referred to him as her in a previous stream bro
[2:36:16] Envivii: there's like one woman in this game
[2:36:16] pogotross: Women aren't allowed to fly space ships, everyone knows that
[2:36:17] DavidPortnov: I love have Falco just has a normal last name.
[2:36:18] Senoquese: he does have a very feminine hat
[2:36:22] bonatide: its the smash bros characters ashton51Uwah
[2:36:23] JTBun: the PC port is so cool
[2:36:39] Navy_Mongoose: we have receipts, don't make me dig them up
[2:36:43] Superfroakie82: we should start claiming things about ashton
[2:36:47] pogotross: that's just lesbian erasure
[2:36:51] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[2:36:51] JTBun: yes
[2:36:52] bonatide: that start screen is so tuff
[2:36:53] JTBun: you should

[2:36:56] PSYCOMMUnist: Do you not like OoT? you're on a bad take roll today
[2:37:09] Senoquese: i think when the combo training started last time you already zoned out
[2:37:12] Senoquese: ashton51Omega
[2:37:22] Navy_Mongoose: @PSYCOMMUnist she loves Legend Of Ashton
[2:37:23] GManx0: WHA
[2:37:23] JTBun: LMAO?
[2:37:34] pogotross: oh that's a terrible take hashtag lttp4lyfe
[2:37:43] rikkaonline: should you invert y controls?
[2:37:49] X_Rok: you missed the Z or R to bank and turn sharply
[2:37:51] HmmHrmHarumph: your only bad take today has been buying Oreos only to eat the cookie part
[2:37:52] Red__2: already failed the tutorial
[2:37:54] Senoquese: i cant believe this woman has opinions #onlyLs
[2:37:56] vermillion2002: Dang this game still looks clean
[2:38:18] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Omegalul
[2:38:20] pogotross: 15 super crisp polygons
[2:38:21] outrunthewind: Didn't learn how to do a barrel roll, sad
[2:38:21] Burr11: dang this game still runs at 144fps
[2:38:26] PSYCOMMUnist: and the framerate/framepacing is fixed to not be shit
[2:38:31] Senoquese: LOOL
[2:38:38] Senoquese: the widescreen does look awesome
[2:39:06] Navy_Mongoose: my roommate is playing OoT oh god the soundtracks are mixing together
[2:39:10] Senoquese: going back to oot would be so fun
[2:39:15] buruhas: This must be a new Expansion Pak for the N64 ashton51Smile
[2:39:16] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Go get em Boss!!
[2:39:29] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: yes they are
[2:39:31] Superfroakie82: women never wore baseball caps in the 90s (fact)
[2:39:33] Navy_Mongoose: the C Buttons are on the TRiggers now
[2:39:33] a_raccoon27: it did for a second
[2:39:34] X_Rok: yeah you're gonna need those
[2:39:36] Kitkattack: I do wonder how they stretched the game ashton51Thinky ashton51Thinky ashton51Thinky
[2:39:39] Deepfreeze2k: They share composition staff.
[2:39:41] PSYCOMMUnist: make sure to memorize the slowdown/speed up buttons or you're going to die for the spaceship interior section
[2:39:47] X_Rok: second stick?
[2:39:54] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @Deepfreeze2k explains a lot
[2:40:01] Navy_Mongoose: Right
[2:40:01] Deepfreeze2k: I dont think its the exact same instrument set, though its probably same drivers and probably shares some instrument data.
[2:40:14] HmmHrmHarumph: O brakes by default
[2:40:19] Red__2: do we need to do the tutorial again?
[2:40:22] Navy_Mongoose: I thought this version moves all the C buttons to the triggers and face buttons
[2:40:24] Burr11: dang this game still has faulty controls
[2:40:25] Senoquese: maybe this port changed controls and didnt update the info
[2:40:28] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: this looks really nice as a PC port
[2:40:31] Deepfreeze2k: I admittedly dont know too much about the tech specs of N64 music though.
[2:40:47] PSYCOMMUnist: please memorize the speed up/slowdown buttons or you will lose your run at one point
[2:41:05] X_Rok: pull up and boost/brake
[2:41:07] Navy_Mongoose: down+boost?
[2:41:16] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: DO a BARREL roll!
[2:41:47] X_Rok: same direction, brake instead of boost
[2:41:57] marudofu: Btw neat trick, if you hold a charge shot and fire a bomb, the bomb will track
[2:42:13] GManx0: How is it so far with what you remember from the switch version
[2:42:19] cho__aniki: oh neat this looks like the PC port
[2:42:24] marudofu: Barrel roll?
[2:42:25] Navy_Mongoose: Left + Boost?
[2:42:42] RedOniVA: This isn't the Starship port, is it?
[2:42:47] yojamjam: this is starship
[2:42:48] X_Rok: down and brake
[2:42:50] Navy_Mongoose: this is Star Ship
[2:42:54] RedOniVA: Nice!
[2:42:58] HmmHrmHarumph: what are you trying?
[2:43:05] Astrolime: meiyaWaiting
[2:43:09] HmmHrmHarumph: down + boost
[2:43:12] X_Rok: down and boost is somersault
[2:43:15] RedOniVA: Down and C-Down, I thought
[2:43:33] Navy_Mongoose: Down and Brake?
[2:43:34] yojamjam: barrel roll is double tap one of the leaning buttons
[2:43:44] HmmHrmHarumph: press the tilt button twice to barrel roll
[2:44:01] Navy_Mongoose: try Down + Brake
[2:44:08] metaconstruct: i wonder how many n64 gpus u could fit in a 5090
[2:44:18] Senoquese: watch her 100% no hit the game first try now that the controls dont suck
[2:44:29] buruhas: So this is the power of the Nvidia 5090...
[2:44:30] metaconstruct: ya lol
[2:44:31] PSYCOMMUnist: the controls were fine on n64
[2:44:36] RedOniVA: You can also "unlock" your charge shots by holding both roll buttons and the fire button, you can get more points that way
[2:44:56] Navy_Mongoose: way easier to play with this controller mapping
[2:45:00] RedOniVA: IF you can hit ships with the splash damage
[2:45:02] GManx0: That tutorial guy looks so fake compared to the actual characters
[2:45:17] yojamjam: fans do what nintendont
[2:45:23] RedOniVA: Fun Fact: That narrator voice is Rick May, the voice of the TF2 Soldier
[2:45:26] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552

[2:45:46] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: best of luck you got this boss
[2:45:56] Senoquese: i could rig it for warudo if you want
[2:46:02] Red__2: simply switch to 144p stream
[2:46:04] Kitkattack: Pls pls pls pls
[2:46:11] Kitkattack: I love crunchy model
[2:46:16] Envivii: didja know Fox's dad was in F-Zero
[2:46:23] Senoquese: the map looks sooo awesome in widescreen wow
[2:46:28] RedOniVA: Some of the Hard Path missions are fun
[2:46:39] RedOniVA: But I usually go Medium route
[2:46:42] yojamjam: she has not played star fox snes
[2:46:43] Navy_Mongoose: wasn't Fox's dad the SNES Star Fox?
[2:46:52] rikkaonline: lol
[2:46:59] DavidPortnov: This is absolutely N64 Zelda. You're right.
[2:47:07] RedOniVA: @Navy_Mongoose SNES Star Fox is usually treated as it's own continuity.
[2:47:19] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @RedOniVA i agree cool dialogues too
[2:47:24] RedOniVA: I'm guessing Star Fox 64 is using a similar soundfont to Zelda 64.
[2:47:31] Red__2: this is giving me peak SW rogue squadron vibes
[2:47:44] Senoquese: i think the lore with the music is both this and oot share the same composer so he just brought the zelda soundfont over with some slight changes
[2:47:48] Burr11: ashton51Omegalul
[2:47:48] RedOniVA: Welcome to Corneria!
[2:47:54] Envivii: this looks goooooood
[2:47:55] Burr11: damn furries and their child soldiers
[2:47:55] Navy_Mongoose: once tadpoles grow limbs they're not babies anymore
[2:47:57] Red__2: the water effects are dope
[2:48:09] RedOniVA: LUL Damnit Slippy, you made me miss the laser upgrade
[2:48:15] Burr11: ashton51Pop
[2:48:26] RedOniVA: "This is horrible..."
[2:48:31] Kitkattack: You should be talking ashton51Pop
[2:48:32] Burr11: ashton51Pop "thanks ashton! you saved me!"
[2:48:55] GManx0: Do a meme
[2:49:04] HmmHrmHarumph: she can do it

[2:49:37] Senoquese: @yojamjam im usually an og defender but wow this port does look awesome
[2:49:54] yojamjam: it's a decomp so it's still totally faithful
[2:49:59] Navy_Mongoose: this port is great
[2:50:11] PSYCOMMUnist: dude if you offered to play a better looking faster version literally everyone at the time would have picked that one
[2:50:12] Burr11: the point is just to try it
[2:50:22] rikkaonline: 3 gold = more healthbar
[2:50:29] Envivii: you got gold, so more health
[2:50:30] RedOniVA: pahichBlob  DO A BARREL ROLL zuzumiKurukuru
[2:50:32] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Both are health, 3 gold gives you more health
[2:50:39] bread_dot_: use da map
[2:50:42] Envivii: yeah u melted him
[2:50:48] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Noooooo
[2:50:49] Burr11: no!!!
[2:50:49] HmmHrmHarumph: NOoooooo
[2:50:56] Senoquese: @PSYCOMMUnist theres still some merit to playing with the limitations of the time
[2:51:09] PSYCOMMUnist: slowdown just sucks ass, there's no real joy to be gained from it
[2:51:31] Senoquese: no no thats fine he can die
[2:51:32] Navy_Mongoose: and N64 emulation is just a bitch for some reason
[2:51:34] Senoquese: GAMER
[2:51:37] bread_dot_: holy own
[2:51:39] Burr11: GAMER
[2:51:41] Senoquese: you did so much better this time
[2:51:41] yojamjam: you're owning
[2:51:44] Burr11: ashton51Clap
[2:51:45] RedOniVA: I'VE FAAAAAILED YOOOOU
[2:51:45] X_Rok: blue laser
[2:51:48] Blaisevtch: to get the secret path in the waterfall you save falco and then go through all the arches with the waterskating robots, it involves a lot of maneuvering and breaking.
[2:51:48] HmmHrmHarumph: you had a fully upgraded lazor
[2:51:49] Navy_Mongoose: you're just more consistent
[2:51:57] Burr11: helps when the game is smoother
[2:51:57] X_Rok: also that weak point doesnt have much hp
[2:52:11] Red__2: You did it! I was worried for a moment
[2:52:19] bread_dot_: james
[2:52:20] Navy_Mongoose: James?
[2:52:22] yojamjam: jim mccloud
[2:52:22] RedOniVA: James McCloud
[2:52:23] HmmHrmHarumph: nah that dude's dead
[2:52:27] Navy_Mongoose: I think James is dead
[2:52:29] GManx0: No he ded
[2:52:30] PSYCOMMUnist: I mean the n64 controller is very unique using other controllers for it is a handicap imo
[2:52:30] TheAsterite: the 3ds starfox has a bunch of melodrama
[2:52:32] RedOniVA: James McClames
[2:52:34] TheAsterite: sorry, ds starfox
[2:52:41] rikkaonline: lol

[2:52:58] Red__2: idk some people are called hugh man
[2:53:05] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: The name's Fox. Fox McCloud. My father is dead.
[2:53:09] T33bags: chinchilla marten

[2:54:13] Aefen: slippy pissed me off as a kid

[3:00:36] Envivii: do you see them in day to day life???
[3:00:37] Kitkattack: Is this your first aerial ace game?
[3:00:40] GManx0: Freeza Chilla
[3:00:48] X_Rok: you can also dodge late, and go up or down and then into a corner
[3:00:50] Navy_Mongoose: @Kitkattack Snail Mail
[3:01:07] X_Rok: it still follows
[3:01:07] GManx0: Would be funny if you still hated it
[3:01:09] zer0hazard: 'had to' rage quit...

[3:01:40] Senoquese: you did have to restart a bunch of times at this point too
[3:01:41] yojamjam: you were struggling with uturns and such
[3:01:54] bread_dot_: hold the trigger of the direction you're turning to turn more sharply iirc
[3:01:57] Aefen: when I was a kid I thought he was saying boogey
[3:02:06] DavidPortnov: Apes were almost us. They just didn't quite make it there.
[3:02:11] Navy_Mongoose: is this Star Wars

[3:51:55] marudofu: You can shoot the rocks he spits at you btw
[3:52:21] demon_dandy: daaaaamn
[3:52:31] Envivii: a guide i found says to dodge the high waves by braking and go to an upper corner
[3:53:19] Returner7: pay attention to the boost gauge on the upper right, if you exhaust it you’ll no longer be able to U-turn, brake, etc. it recovers over time
[3:53:20] marudofu: You can shoot his shoulders
[3:53:28] marudofu: You don't need to fly down to shoot his arm
[3:54:24] LeeShade1: I forgot. what happens when you collect 3 gold rings again?
[3:54:42] marudofu: Your health increases
[3:54:44] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: @LeeShade1 Double health
[3:54:47] Navy_Mongoose: isnt 3 gold a health up?

[3:55:21] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:55:23] Senoquese: she RAN
[3:55:26] AmethystViper: @Navy_Mongoose For the first three gold rings, yes. The next three gives an extra life afterwards.
[3:55:28] yojamjam: !startrace
[3:55:30] JTBun: gopissgirl

[3:56:56] bonatide: Weba lil bro
[3:57:04] Returner7: it’s ok we all sorta hate this level lol
[3:57:05] Navy_Mongoose: let me itch it ashton51Squisher
[3:57:10] LeeShade1: might want to soak that foot in hot water with epsom salt
[3:57:41] Envivii: they're smart enough to not fight the giant bug on the surface of the sun lmao
[3:57:41] HmmHrmHarumph: the rest of Star Fox are just hype men
[3:57:42] TheAsterite: i like how the hard route avoids this stage
[3:57:44] Senoquese: LOL
[3:57:46] TheAsterite: LUL
[3:57:55] bonatide: Nasty ass chilla got fleas
[3:58:13] Senoquese: i feel if you never had that rant about omg bugs are gonna fall on me theres so many bugs, this would have never happened
[3:58:15] Senoquese: it was your karma
[3:59:37] Navy_Mongoose: there is no dodge, you just gotta move out of the way
[3:59:37] LeeShade1: might be difficult to dodge once he loses both arms
[3:59:48] marudofu: Theoretically, if you had blue lasers, he'd be dead before he can do anything LUL
[4:00:04] AmethystViper: There's the somersault and the U-turn but the later is only usable in All-Range mode.
[4:00:13] demon_dandy: Alright you got thissss ashton51Tensai
[4:00:17] LeeShade1: oof
[4:00:27] demon_dandy: Ahhh aside from dive bombing right into the lava
[4:00:32] LeeShade1: health boost!
[4:00:42] LeeShade1: congrats on the 3 gold rings!

[4:05:27] yojamjam: never give up! trust your instincts!
[4:05:40] PSYCOMMUnist: backseating advice owned
[4:05:41] a_raccoon27: shoot the boss vtuber!
[4:05:49] HmmHrmHarumph: any failure in this game is simply because Ashton is not locked in enough
[4:05:54] deafmutelaughing: I do not TAKE ADVICE I do not LEARN MECHANICS FROM CHAT I use the strategies I FEEL LIKE LEARNING and if I fail I DO IT OVER AGAIN
[4:06:05] Navy_Mongoose: dammit peppy she jsut said no backseating
[4:06:13] a_raccoon27: does the barrel roll have i-frames?
[4:06:14] LeeShade1: oof
[4:06:21] HmmHrmHarumph: @a_raccoon27 no
[4:06:28] Navy_Mongoose: I think barrel roll just deflects lasers
[4:06:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[4:06:29] Senoquese: OMG
[4:06:33] Senoquese: are you good ashton51ICANT
[4:06:33] LeeShade1: dang
[4:06:35] Envivii: NOOOOO
[4:06:35] yojamjam: BANANA SLAMMA
[4:06:37] vermillion2002: RAGEY
[4:06:40] HmmHrmHarumph: desk slamming. That's how you know its a real game
[4:06:41] Red__2: lmaoooo
[4:06:41] demon_dandy: That jab is so fast LOL
[4:06:42] a_raccoon27: understandable
[4:06:45] bonatide: essiec1Laughing
[4:06:50] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: oh nyo
[4:06:52] PSYCOMMUnist: why not pick an actually fun level
[4:06:53] DavidPortnov: We getting the crashout now.
[4:06:55] Navy_Mongoose: there is no dodge button, you just have to move out of the way
[4:06:55] Red__2: eyyy got a good rank tho
[4:06:57] HmmHrmHarumph: hi score though ashton51Pog
[4:06:57] spikebomb5: time to turn off the console and go play outside
[4:06:58] Returner7: LOL you could try easy route first
[4:07:01] marudofu: When he about to swipe, just move the opposite of his arm!!
[4:07:02] yojamjam: you are allowed to not go there
[4:07:11] HmmHrmHarumph: you do pick the level lol
[4:07:14] PSYCOMMUnist: ??? since when
[4:07:14] Senoquese: i thinkkkk uhh the game is broken ashton51Baby
[4:07:22] Navy_Mongoose: that level is a shortcut, you can choose somewhere else
[4:07:28] T33bags: Ashton has never tried to be good at a game that’s so that when she does bad it’s because she’s not trying and when she does good it’s because she’s really good but nonchalant about it
[4:07:28] RedOniVA: I mean, there IS a Level Selector option, but that's a developer option
[4:07:29] LeeShade1: well, the route chosen depends on the mission’s success per world
[4:08:04] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: i thought there was an invincibility frame with the barrel roll  i Guess im wrong
[4:08:10] Senoquese: youre gonna start trying during our deadlock matches and carry all of us
[4:08:11] marudofu: Also if you get blue lasers and DON'T lose it, when you're at the sun, you can kill the boss really fast!
[4:08:16] yojamjam: somebody's invested ashton51Heh ashton51Heh ashton51Heh ashton51Heh
[4:08:22] demon_dandy: Classic
[4:08:27] Envivii: love me some corneria
[4:08:27] yojamjam: somebody likes the game ashton51Heh ashton51Heh
[4:08:42] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: lol character fail jeeze that hits so deep
[4:08:59] T33bags: @Senoquese no she can’t start trying during deadlock because it would make the pitcrew look bad and beta and then they wouldn’t want to play with her
[4:09:01] LeeShade1: so, how does it feel to pilot an aircraft instead of riding a car?
[4:09:04] Redamaford: barrel roll can deflect stuff like lasers, but no collisions.
[4:09:09] deafmutelaughing: this is my approach to mental illness
[4:09:14] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: lol fuck
[4:09:17] demon_dandy: LOL
[4:09:26] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[4:09:56] Envivii: this game's so cooool
[4:10:18] hototari: chat don’t worry Ashton can play the game now I’ve finally made it
[4:10:18] demon_dandy: Maybe running out of boost bar?
[4:10:24] Returner7: pay attention to the boost gauge on the upper right, if you exhaust it you’ll no longer be able to U-turn, brake, etc. it recovers over time
[4:10:32] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: hands down one of the dopest game series
[4:10:57] HmmHrmHarumph: soooo true
[4:11:01] Senoquese: LOLL
[4:11:06] roflsaurusflex: i think you have half the input window cuz of the fps
[4:11:06] Senoquese: you heard it from her, game SUCKS
[4:11:11] yojamjam: the timing for the directional input on uturn/ss are weird
[4:11:19] Envivii: ashton51Wah she hates it
[4:11:20] LeeShade1: this boss can be very funny if you disable his legs. he just struggles on the ground insulting you
[4:11:21] donothang: hi ashton
[4:11:22] Returner7: ashton51ICANT ashton51ICANT ashton51ICANT
[4:11:24] donothang: u winnin
[4:11:27] demon_dandy: Classic
[4:11:37] T33bags: actually Ashton is blindfolded and playing with one hand and also she passed the controller to sistermarten when we weren’t looking
[4:11:45] Navy_Mongoose: NOOooooo
[4:11:56] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: its not a cake walk of a game or anything, its kinda a tough one
[4:12:14] LeeShade1: LOL
[4:12:33] LeeShade1: you certainly took him down a leg. LOL
[4:12:35] demon_dandy: Imagine you get told to pilot whatever that dude had to drive
[4:12:49] Envivii: when u played it before idk it seems like it was hard to do delicate motions
[4:13:08] demon_dandy: Falco went down like immediately ashton51Tehe
[4:13:23] Senoquese: the switch emulator seems like its at 10x sensitivity its crazy
[4:13:25] deafmutelaughing: or like playing any part of donkey kong 64
[4:13:31] marudofu: You should try following the blue rings in this level this time!
[4:13:36] LeeShade1: oh! Patches or Patchy!
[4:13:44] HmmHrmHarumph: just for the level
[4:14:07] Navy_Mongoose: its jsut because mapping C to the Right Stick is so terrible
[4:14:19] Navy_Mongoose: but it kind of has to be that way when emulating
[4:14:24] demon_dandy: Shoots slippy for fun
[4:14:31] marudofu: Just for the level
[4:14:32] Navy_Mongoose: just for the level
[4:14:35] RedOniVA: For the rest of the level.
[4:14:46] Envivii: i wonder if the switch emulator is just either 0 or 100 for analog motion
[4:14:52] Returner7: There was a stick sensitivity issue on the switch emulators
[4:15:11] LeeShade1: nice flip maneuver
[4:15:16] Senoquese: @Envivii its not it just has a really aggressive deadzone
[4:15:26] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[4:15:39] Senoquese: so most physical analog inputs are ignored unless you push all the way in
[4:15:48] LeeShade1: she’s locked in! literally!
[4:15:49] marudofu: Now DONT LOSE YOUR BLUE LASERS
[4:15:53] Envivii: @Senoquese goooot it yeah that makes sense
[4:15:54] marudofu: They're soo strong!!
[4:16:20] RedOniVA: REally? That kinda sucks for the Switch emu
[4:16:29] LeeShade1: down with the annoying fly
[4:16:38] demon_dandy: LMAO
[4:16:46] HmmHrmHarumph: wooow Slippy's so cool Flirt
[4:16:58] marudofu: NOOOO
[4:16:59] demon_dandy: ashton51Wah ashton51Wah
[4:17:05] LeeShade1: good try though
[4:17:31] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[4:18:13] roflsaurusflex: it does put you on a secret route
[4:18:15] yojamjam: the blue rings do put you on a route
[4:18:18] HmmHrmHarumph: it does put you on a dif route
[4:18:19] marudofu: No those small blue rings gives you a secret route
[4:18:27] LeeShade1: reminds me of the Space Colony Ark tech
[4:18:46] marudofu: Also there's a setting on pc starfox that lets you rapidfire
[4:18:51] TheAsterite: TheAsterite subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 35 months! I admit deez
[4:18:55] HmmHrmHarumph: he should have a 10% chance of actually giving up
[4:18:56] marudofu: If you don't want to keep mashing the button LUL
[4:19:06] LeeShade1: nice!
[4:19:12] roflsaurusflex: i love the voice acting for this game

[4:25:50] demon_dandy: she wont admit to it but the slippy carry ashton51Sus
[4:26:02] SoundBorg_wav: Slippy does not deserve all the slander
[4:26:25] demon_dandy: LMAO
[4:27:16] HmmHrmHarumph: you locked in and used your innate gaming ability
[4:27:58] SoundBorg_wav: Yes it breaks the lock
[4:28:04] vermillion2002: They reflect your shots
[4:28:08] demon_dandy: What da heck
[4:28:27] RedOniVA: Based on the graphics, I just assumed it generates some kind of field that breaks lock-on and deflects shots
[4:28:43] marudofu: The trick is, to shoot them while they're looping
[4:28:59] marudofu: But they would have died faster if you still had blue lasers
[4:29:13] demon_dandy: Clueless
[4:29:39] Navy_Mongoose: if you pick up the weapon upgrade?
[4:29:55] RedOniVA: If you press Start when they first appear, you can skip the little intro  cutscene and aim at them before they actually start flying around
[4:29:57] AmethystViper: Blue Lasers = Lv. 2 shot power. Dual Blue Lasers = Lv. 3 shot power.
[4:30:00] HmmHrmHarumph: Using the brakes to keep them in your sights when they loop is useful
[4:30:08] SoundBorg_wav: Single green < double green < double blue. They also sound cooler, but that's neither here nor there LUL
[4:30:08] thomas2uentin: o7
[4:30:33] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: its a cool level but fucking imposible
[4:30:43] ThrowRacket: better air and space combat games let you target specific enemies and it constantly track them even offscreen
[4:30:50] Navy_Mongoose: its an item pickup
[4:30:53] RedOniVA: It's those arwing with the L pickups
[4:30:56] Navy_Mongoose: sometimes ROB will give you one
[4:31:03] SoundBorg_wav: I've only been in here a couple minutes, but you've done training yes?
[4:31:06] AmethystViper: The Power-up that looks like Arwing guns.
[4:31:22] SoundBorg_wav: Or did you just dive right in
[4:31:28] AmethystViper: If it helps, there should be a C-button (or right stick on this port)  to change the camera modes.
[4:31:37] SoundBorg_wav: There is yes
[4:31:39] donothang: sowwy ashton i gotta go
[4:31:44] donothang: wub u bye byre
[4:31:49] SoundBorg_wav: You want Star wolf tips?

[5:02:05] roflsaurusflex: was James officially declared dead or MIA?
[5:02:06] pogotross: Maybe Zelda was in space all along
[5:02:07] SoundBorg_wav: Well it's the same instrument set isnwhy
[5:02:08] demon_dandy: I can kinda feel that LOL
[5:02:09] bonatide: whimsical as they come
[5:02:09] Playmer: Oh man as a not zelda person this is so ingrained in me.
[5:02:10] ArthurWar: Yeah, we get the more spacey stuff in later games
[5:02:10] HmmHrmHarumph: but its like Star Wars or some shit
[5:02:11] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: fair
[5:02:15] RedOniVA: You heard the instruments in Zelda first, not surprising
[5:02:15] yojamjam: later games have full orchestra arrangements of these themes and they're spacier
[5:02:20] LeeShade1: 👏👏👏👏👏
[5:02:25] Playmer: I do hear it now that you're pointing it out.
[5:02:41] Senoquese: same composer as oot that brought over the soundfont yeah
[5:02:42] outrunthewind: Maybe you could make it spacey, but you'd need to add a lot to it
[5:02:50] PSYCOMMUnist: congrats on beating it Ashton, good job
[5:02:51] Playmer: I mean I was playing this on a CRT in my grandparents living room as they watched TV lol.
[5:03:01] SoundBorg_wav: I was scared that ads would ruin your reaction to andross. Instead the payment screen did LUL
[5:03:07] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: But you did well!
[5:03:08] demon_dandy: We need to come back to legend of ashton ashton51Tensai
[5:03:10] MeowHong: Love Koji Kondo.
[5:03:22] demon_dandy: ashton51Cringe
[5:03:25] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: my loins girded
[5:03:28] SoundBorg_wav: TO BE FAIR, I did ASK if you wanted help, I wasn't born yesterday LUL
[5:03:31] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: yes
[5:03:37] Senoquese: LOL
[5:03:39] ArthurWar: LOL
[5:03:42] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: stop there
[5:03:45] Red__2: LMAO
[5:03:48] cho__aniki: Star Fox looks like a muppet
[5:03:49] DavidPortnov: The iconic quote.
[5:03:50] Senoquese: you should kneel and slap the hell out of us
[5:03:50] roflsaurusflex: they're soooo kewwwwl!
[5:03:52] LeeShade1: Ma-what-now?
[5:03:58] roflsaurusflex: the ship is named great fox
[5:04:00] Playmer: Great Fox is their big ship
[5:04:00] demon_dandy: Nahhhhh they look so tuff there
[5:04:01] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: mcluky? wtf
[5:04:03] marudofu: Great fox is their mother ship LUL
[5:04:03] Red__2: im gonna have to not use my soundboard for a bit then
[5:04:04] AlexDD00: Maclunky!
[5:04:07] SoundBorg_wav: Nah, great Fox is their big ship
[5:04:11] MeowHong: Greatfox is your carrier ship.
[5:04:14] KayAlamode: finally learned where the Smash Bros. stage came from
[5:04:14] zer0hazard: grey fox is a metal gear rank
[5:04:17] Deepfreeze2k: @cho__aniki Starfox was inspired by Thunderbirds somehow. So the puppet look makes sense.
[5:04:17] RedOniVA: Your mother ship is called the Great Fox. Star Fox is the mercenary group.
[5:04:21] outrunthewind: Yeah, this is Hyrule Field
[5:04:22] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[5:04:26] Navy_Mongoose: that was a sacriligous Lucas edit
[5:04:29] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[5:04:32] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: fair
[5:04:33] pogotross: om you gotta get that discord channel where only the streamer can talk
[5:04:42] roflsaurusflex: slippy really run like that huh
[5:04:45] Senoquese: when han solo does his pose can we poke you again and again to show you the photo we printed of him
[5:04:46] bonatide: shes sitting us down giving us the "im not mad, im just disappointed" like a mom
[5:04:48] SoundBorg_wav: Also, I got in super late, so I had no idea how much you'd played before LUL
[5:04:50] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: idont wanna ruin it for ya
[5:05:15] SoundBorg_wav: Slippy's falling behind LUL
[5:05:28] HmmHrmHarumph: look how close Fox & Falco are running ashton51Blush
[5:05:36] pogotross: have you tried doing a barrel roll?
[5:05:37] Playmer: The really wild thing is Star Fox came out like a year before Ocarina of Time, which I didn't even realize until you brought up the music thing.
[5:05:38] outrunthewind: UM ACKSHUALLY
[5:05:38] SoundBorg_wav: I read the rules, I made sure to ask erosOMEGALUL erosOMEGALUL erosOMEGALUL
[5:05:44] bonatide: just do it is comedic genius
[5:05:49] RedOniVA: And off Star Fox team goes, to not star in another game for another 4 years
[5:05:52] demon_dandy: Just dodge ?
[5:05:53] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: lol i feel ya
[5:05:53] niertlwal: dip duck dodge and duck
[5:05:56] Navy_Mongoose: you mean the things you yap over, don't understand, then ask but get upset when someone answers you?
[5:05:56] AlexDD00: Just don't get hit EZ
[5:05:58] Red__2: just buy counterspell, debuff remover and hit the parry on time every time ez
[5:05:59] Senoquese: LOLL
[5:06:10] roflsaurusflex: monkaW he's still out there...
[5:06:13] pogotross: ok but OOT was delayed a lot
[5:06:13] LeeShade1: Congrats! you got the “Andross is still out there” ending!
[5:06:16] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: yes
[5:06:17] SoundBorg_wav: Yeah, same instruments LUL
[5:06:18] DatBoiVLC: aurGG
[5:06:18] outrunthewind: You completely missed that part of the tutorial
[5:06:25] yojamjam: arwings are debug enemies in oot :)
[5:06:27] X_Rok: a lot of n64 music used that soundfont
[5:06:31] Envivii: EXAAAAACTLY
[5:06:33] RedOniVA: AAA
[5:06:35] outrunthewind: It went by while you were looking at chat for a sec
[5:06:35] roflsaurusflex: @yojamjam yeah this!
[5:06:37] Senoquese: oot did start development in 1994 and star fox started in 1995
[5:06:42] niertlwal: just be a parry god (it's easy)
[5:06:56] MeowHong: Oh yeah, when they were programming flight for Keese, they imported in the Arwings to test them, so Arwings are actually in the code for Ocarina.
[5:07:01] Red__2: there are 20 dead messenchillas in the back here wtf
[5:07:06] pogotross: did you try plugging in a controller?
[5:07:07] Playmer: I'm not gonna lie, got slightly tilted at you not realizing to shoot the eyes.
[5:07:10] bonatide: youre telling me
[5:07:10] AmethystViper: The somersault by pressing Down and Boost
[5:07:15] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy
[5:07:19] RedOniVA: Glad we could help, General Pepper! ...Now pay up Kappa
[5:07:23] Senoquese: tbf it did not felt like the eyes were a weak point at all
[5:07:24] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: epic work
[5:07:30] SoundBorg_wav: ONE MORE RUN LETS GO erosHypers erosHypers erosHypers ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[5:07:33] Playmer: But I don't think I first tried andross at 7 or whatever so who am I to judge.
[5:07:57] SoundBorg_wav: Fair, still glad I got to be here for the end of it! ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer

[5:08:05] Senoquese: thanks for the star foxing!
[5:08:09] DavidPortnov: We got through it!

[5:08:36] bonatide: next time youre wondering you can do an art stream ashton51Love
[5:08:46] zer0hazard: you could go classic and do River City Ransom
[5:08:53] Senoquese: i guess art is retro
[5:08:58] ArthurWar: They genuinely may have made it only work best with the replica N64 controller lol
[5:08:59] DatBoiVLC: glad you got your justice in the runback this stream
[5:09:04] SoundBorg_wav: Yeah official ports that aren't the N64 or 3DS are rough
[5:09:06] AmethystViper: The wii VC plays better I'll bet
[5:09:07] PSYCOMMUnist: Nintendo official emulation sucks laggy and bad
[5:09:11] Envivii: im rlly glad u liked it
[5:09:12] SoundBorg_wav: And now you know you can do it
[5:09:14] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: art stream? that'd be cool
[5:09:18] Playmer: Star Fox is so rewarding in that way
[5:09:24] demon_dandy: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[5:09:28] AmethystViper: And thanks for streaming Ashton!
[5:09:32] SoundBorg_wav: I still remember getting punished by bosses in my youth
[5:09:34] demon_dandy: I missed ashton ashton51Squish
[5:09:34] niertlwal: the beat drop???
[5:09:36] Playmer: As you get better you get to play the different levels and explore the routes.
[5:09:36] SoundBorg_wav: HELL YEAH
[5:09:48] Senoquese: this sounds like it could be a 40 second intro in the same album as da boing boing trak
[5:09:55] Navy_Mongoose: hard route does skip Solar ashton51Omegalul
[5:09:57] demon_dandy: What da heck
[5:10:00] HmmHrmHarumph: ashton51Baby more Star Fawks
[5:10:00] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: yes, s afew run throughs and itll be cake

[5:10:19] yojamjam: going from starship to this you'll feel the lag for sure
[5:10:31] Senoquese: LOL
[5:10:32] Playmer: Bill's so great
[5:10:34] demon_dandy: Bill was kinda a real one
[5:10:34] Navy_Mongoose: you killed Bill
[5:10:40] Navy_Mongoose: no
[5:10:43] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: man i dont remember any of the lore

[5:12:04] Envivii: hewwo raiders
[5:12:09] PSYCOMMUnist: Nintendo is so funny they want you to pay like 160$ a year for inferior emulation to Dolphin that anyone who can google Vimm's Lair could get for free
[5:12:16] bonatide: hi raiders ashton51Baby
[5:12:18] muyoEishi: Oh raid
[5:12:25] souly_ch: hiiiiii

[5:13:19] Senoquese: LOL like its an arcade stick?
[5:13:22] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[5:13:48] PSYCOMMUnist: Every outlet that covers Switch emulation says it has serious input lag
[5:13:51] PSYCOMMUnist: It's not your imagination
[5:13:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Souly delivery!
[5:14:01] souly_ch: it looks difficulty
[5:14:25] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I think you can remap them?
[5:14:30] PSYCOMMUnist: Switch 2 has like 40ms of input lag lmao
[5:14:37] Playmer: I can't believe my oshi had a skill issue
[5:14:39] bonatide: it was really a skill issue...
[5:14:42] HmmHrmHarumph: it definitely looks more sensitive though
[5:15:01] demon_dandy: Waaaait cockpit mode ashton51Hehe
[5:15:08] Navy_Mongoose: haha time for GOD AWFUL CONTROLS
[5:15:10] SoundBorg_wav: eugh, joycons are a hell of a way to fly ashton51Despair ashton51Despair ashton51Despair
[5:15:13] Senoquese: are you also playing through obs and adding even more input lag
[5:15:26] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[5:15:39] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: yeah
[5:15:48] PSYCOMMUnist: For reference Tekken has like 8ms of input lag so it's about 4x standard
[5:16:12] pogotross: ashton51Stare
[5:16:12] Playmer: The laser upgrades are so stong
[5:16:15] SoundBorg_wav: Oh yeah, I grab em whenever they're available
[5:16:17] Deepfreeze2k: Yeah, the laser upgrades are huge
[5:16:19] demon_dandy: Blue moded ashton51Uwah ashton51Uwah
[5:16:23] HmmHrmHarumph: one more run
[5:16:28] SoundBorg_wav: Hahahaha, see??? One more run LUL
[5:16:39] AmethystViper: They also recover your arwing's wings.
[5:16:49] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[5:16:51] Playmer: You boost and pull the stick back at the same time
[5:17:17] SoundBorg_wav: I've put so many hours into this game I'm probably eleigitfor an ACTUAL pilot's license ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[5:17:18] AmethystViper: Also I got somersault mixed up, it was Down + Brake.
[5:17:36] Playmer: You get used to it
[5:17:45] SoundBorg_wav: *Eligible
[5:17:51] demon_dandy: damn shes good ashton51Tensai
[5:17:52] faizdanyal: Nice one.
[5:17:57] Playmer: To be clear I don't know how the controls are on the switch
[5:18:12] Playmer: I'm not?
[5:18:15] roflsaurusflex: double sticks feels way jankier than stick + button
[5:18:18] SoundBorg_wav: Oh it is. Starship is fantastic
[5:18:21] Senoquese: the worst part of these emulations is that you still have to translate button inputs between controllers in your head
[5:18:26] Senoquese: imo atleast
[5:18:27] Playmer: I was only explaining the commands you need to input.
[5:18:33] Playmer: Not the ergonomics of the command.
[5:18:46] ArthurWar: Having the original form factor weirdly helps, as strange as the controller was
[5:18:48] Playmer: That's why I just said boost
[5:18:50] demon_dandy: Dont even got it on me
[5:18:56] pogotross: ashton51Stare erm the N64 didn't have a c stick they were buttons
[5:18:58] Navy_Mongoose: Ashton press the X button
[5:19:17] Senoquese: i was told i was going to lylat but i just got my c stick cut off
[5:19:20] pogotross: ok so first imagine you're holding a bunch of bananas...
[5:19:44] Navy_Mongoose: at least Starship has controls that make sense, right trigger is gas and left trigger i brake
[5:19:49] pogotross: idk but to promote dk64 they sent out bananna controller covers om
[5:19:55] bonatide: the whining comes free with your chilla
[5:19:55] Playmer: I need to play the PC port so bad....
[5:20:00] Playmer: I bet it's amazing in 4k.
[5:20:06] yojamjam: they weren't sure if the analog stick would work out long term so they hedged with three handles
[5:20:06] zer0hazard: it was supposed to be able to be held in different points to make different control layouts
[5:20:12] demon_dandy: Shes stanced up CAUGHT
[5:20:31] pogotross: it was a different time ashton you don't understand
[5:20:40] Navy_Mongoose: nintendo thought gamers of the future would have 3 hands
[5:20:42] Playmer: It really was literally a different time.
[5:20:42] AmethystViper: I have Starship installed and it plays great even at 1080p.
[5:20:47] demon_dandy: The n64 controller feels nice as fuck but you got like 30 percent weirder buttons LOL
[5:20:48] Senoquese: theres plenty of reasons for the n64 controller to be like that but it doesnt excuse it sucking ass
[5:21:04] SoundBorg_wav: Ergonomically
[5:21:12] Navy_Mongoose: you would like the N64 version if you used an N64 controller
[5:21:14] pogotross: low key holding the bannana was nice
[5:21:15] SoundBorg_wav: And also feels right for Star Fox
[5:21:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah n64 controllers were bad for reliability movement tech wise but they were comfy to hold
[5:21:18] Playmer: You're only holding two
[5:21:20] demon_dandy: Yeah i dunno why having the middle stick feels kinda easy
[5:21:21] ArthurWar: Yeah, you just pick two of the three handles
[5:21:22] yojamjam: one thing n64 controller got right was 6 face buttons
[5:21:27] SoundBorg_wav: You never use the left handle LUL
[5:21:39] HmmHrmHarumph: no but there should've been
[5:21:41] SoundBorg_wav: Ive never played one lul
[5:21:41] Senoquese: no
[5:21:42] Playmer: It was just the stick on the inside
[5:21:44] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: The only buttons on the inside are the start button, and the Z button
[5:21:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you either hold the outsides and avoid the stick or use the stick and the buttons no DPAD
[5:21:50] pogotross: only like...the star wars game for cheat codes
[5:21:50] Navy_Mongoose: no, at most they were an option
[5:21:53] roflsaurusflex: uhhh i think turok sorta used them like that
[5:21:55] Playmer: I mean there was Z but they'd have you use L
[5:21:58] demon_dandy: No they didnt invent that yet
[5:22:03] Deepfreeze2k: N64 games are absolutely designed for the N64 in mind. They're a bit jank, but they are ergonomic when the game's controls are designed for it. Also only 1 stick.
[5:22:04] Navy_Mongoose: just stick and Z trigger
[5:22:04] AmethystViper: yep
[5:22:06] DatBoiVLC: stick and z
[5:22:06] pogotross: stick and z
[5:22:07] ArthurWar: Very few games made major use of the d-pad, I only remember using it to control menus in Pokemon Stadiumj
[5:22:09] yojamjam: z button was left hand trigger
[5:22:12] Navy_Mongoose: D Pad had L Bumper
[5:22:17] AmethystViper: Stick and Z button
[5:22:17] DavidPortnov: Z was the trigger pretty much.
[5:22:18] zer0hazard: it had a trigger
[5:22:19] Senoquese: you had a lot of inputs but most games only used one holding scheme and never made you switch
[5:22:24] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[5:22:24] Deepfreeze2k: Yep
[5:22:25] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: The center and the left handle are basically the same, just one has the stick, and the other has a dpad.
[5:22:29] roflsaurusflex: Turok would have you move with C buttons and adjust aim with d-pad i think
[5:22:33] Navy_Mongoose: bring up a 3d model of the controller
[5:22:43] PSYCOMMUnist: Trust me you're not coping, even the best monitors today are less responsive than a CRT, let alone emulation added lag
[5:22:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah its very ergonomic if you got one
[5:22:50] vtuberacingcorp: You do
[5:22:54] Navy_Mongoose: like on the Wii Nunchuk
[5:22:56] vtuberacingcorp: You literally have an N64.
[5:23:07] mrp0p1nfr3sh: LOL
[5:23:08] Deepfreeze2k: Like I dont like the N64 controller for anything besides the N64, the joystick has a high fail rate, and its a funky shape, but for N64 games, not much beats it.
[5:23:08] thomas2uentin: rustle rustle rustle
[5:23:17] bonatide: zoomer when wii gets mentioned ashton51Uwah
[5:23:19] demon_dandy: Yeye just hold the middle stick and the right stick
[5:23:19] Navy_Mongoose: psst... handcam
[5:23:20] asilveras: Yeah, Nintendo reuses a lot of parts
[5:23:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: your left hand either goes on the dpad handle or the stick handle
[5:23:28] pogotross: for the time yeah
[5:23:30] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: N64 controller design worked but it was never ideal imo the design was tedius.  PS type controllers are the ideal for me
[5:23:37] Playmer: You don't know what the controllers at the time were like
[5:23:39] roflsaurusflex: ergonomic with an emphasis on the er
[5:23:42] Navy_Mongoose: Z or R twice
[5:23:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: no
[5:23:46] DatBoiVLC: no
[5:23:47] thomas2uentin: c buttons
[5:23:49] HmmHrmHarumph: the yellow buttons are c
[5:23:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: theres no cstick on the n64
[5:23:50] DatBoiVLC: omash
[5:23:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: theres c buttons
[5:23:54] thomas2uentin: c buttons are the yellow ones
[5:23:55] corpswag: You had c buttons on the right
[5:23:55] AmethystViper: C buttons
[5:24:00] zer0hazard: yellow buttons are C
[5:24:04] pogotross: c buttons press buttons
[5:24:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: correct
[5:24:10] asilveras: C is for camera, right?
[5:24:16] demon_dandy: I c button, i press button ninoegGOOFY
[5:24:26] Navy_Mongoose: C is for brake, boost, camera, and ROB
[5:24:28] HmmHrmHarumph: boost is left C, brake is Down
[5:24:28] pogotross: @asilveras yes but iirc nintendo patented that so no one else could do it om
[5:24:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the problem is the stick wears down on the cup and ball and can cause sag and miss inputs
[5:24:41] asilveras: Bruuuuhhh Nintendo you piece
[5:24:45] Playmer: Turn around is boost and down, somersalt is brake and down.
[5:24:59] AmethystViper: ^
[5:25:06] HmmHrmHarumph: no down c is brake
[5:25:11] Navy_Mongoose: no, C Down is Brake.
[5:25:19] pogotross: we can't see the controller ashton51Stare
[5:25:28] Navy_Mongoose: Down + Down C Is U-Turn
[5:25:34] pogotross: we don't know that ashton51Stare
[5:25:35] Playmer: Down C is Brake, left C is boost iirc.
[5:25:36] Aefen: LMAO
[5:25:40] demon_dandy: Next we putting her in goldeneye
[5:25:45] HmmHrmHarumph: left C
[5:25:47] Navy_Mongoose: Left C, but yes
[5:26:06] AmethystViper: I'd vote for Sin & Punishment
[5:26:06] asilveras: Eye C, eye C...
[5:26:09] mareeples: @demon_dandy with 2 controller mode ? ashton51Heyyy
[5:26:12] Playmer: It's like anything, you do get used to it, but like, let us not pretend it's not a bit jank.
[5:26:20] pogotross: mmmmm gammer jello
[5:26:21] asilveras: Oh sin and punishment, I liked that game
[5:26:24] horribleham: horribleham subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! ashton51Dumpy 3 year!!!!!!!
[5:26:26] DatBoiVLC: graveweavBoomer feeling old af watching her experience the n64 controller for the first time
[5:26:34] DatBoiVLC: ham ashton51Love
[5:26:50] asilveras: ham ashton51Woo
[5:26:51] Navy_Mongoose: Just imagine playing Ocarina on this compared to a modern controller
[5:26:54] HmmHrmHarumph: nah that shit's awesome
[5:27:07] horribleham: amaiumWiggle
[5:27:07] Aefen: they should make more bullshit controllers
[5:27:14] Playmer: They're conceptually similar. But like, dark souls kick is like that and it's awful.
[5:27:18] pogotross: they were still trying to figure it out, it was all new back them
[5:27:21] Senoquese: uhh
[5:27:24] horribleham: they should make it weirder
[5:27:25] SoundBorg_wav: If you put your thumb over it, it will naturally cover Cv and C<, which is your throttle; shift your thumb down a little Nd it will cover A and B, which is your fire control
[5:27:25] Navy_Mongoose: yes (no)
[5:27:26] PSYCOMMUnist: N64 is when 3d was completely brand new and the rules of how to control 3d space was being founded
[5:27:31] Playmer: The thing is somersalt _does_ slow you donw.
[5:27:35] demon_dandy: Left right trigger uh huh uh huh ashton51Noted
[5:27:37] asilveras: I only know quarter circle forward punch for DP
[5:27:44] Senoquese: do you mean like how fighting games do it
[5:27:56] PSYCOMMUnist: No getting used to 3d took a couple years
[5:27:59] SoundBorg_wav: Shit I might be a newtype monikaaCookieStare
[5:28:01] PSYCOMMUnist: It was really freakish to us at first
[5:28:40] Playmer: You might be a newtype but if you don't have a cyber newtype fall in love and die for you, you're kind of useless.
[5:28:57] demon_dandy: Ohhhh yeah i see that now when you did that
[5:29:02] Navy_Mongoose: have you played OoT with the C  Buttons on Right Stick?
[5:29:05] SoundBorg_wav: You gotta think of the buttons as being in diagonal lines, and therefore you hit the one in the general direction of where you wanna go
[5:29:06] thomas2uentin: found a list with all the controls for each system in was on
[5:29:09] vtuberacingcorp: We could get you an adapter
[5:29:19] horribleham: sounds like she's playing with a nerf gun lol
[5:29:26] pogotross: ashton51Stare yeah you plug it into an n64
[5:29:28] Aefen: she HATES retro games
[5:29:38] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[5:29:44] Deepfreeze2k: Yeah, plenty of older games are the wild west with controls.
[5:29:53] Senoquese: fighting games do that still where a bunch of inputs are crammed into a single button
[5:30:07] Deepfreeze2k: Late 70s and early 80s computer games are absolutely wild for controls.
[5:30:11] pogotross: NES games are WILD for this
[5:30:18] SoundBorg_wav: I wish I could draw you a diagram to explain my busted thought process LUL
[5:30:20] PSYCOMMUnist: Considering how similar it is to the original SM64 did an incredible job of nailing it first try
[5:30:24] HmmHrmHarumph: the game would be worse if U-turn was on a separate button. Can't explain why it just would be
[5:30:34] demon_dandy: "Its kinda... interesting ashton51Cringe "
[5:30:35] bonatide: shes so pissed ashton51Despair oh man...
[5:30:36] Navy_Mongoose: reminder: A game journalist once stated that  Moving with Left Stick and Aiming with Right Stick was bad because it was new
[5:30:36] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: why would qwerty be designed to mke you type slower?
[5:30:40] Aefen: yeah NES games are crazy, they have 2 buttons and don’t have a uniform control scheme
[5:30:46] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: wierd
[5:30:58] Senoquese: you play super mario
[5:31:01] Woulfgang: cerbyBounce cerbyBounce
[5:31:01] Deepfreeze2k: @OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__ To prevent jams on typewriters.
[5:31:03] pogotross: you played mario and mega man
[5:31:03] Senoquese: i think thats it tho
[5:31:04] Navy_Mongoose: you played Mario and Mega man
[5:31:07] Senoquese: oh yeah megaman
[5:31:08] Dhekranh: another reason for those kind of button settings was because back in the day they had way less buttons (and also the N64 controllers were f***ing weird)
[5:31:14] PSYCOMMUnist: I highly recommend Super Mario Brothers 3, it's still the best one to me
[5:31:16] pogotross: ashton51Stare play Ninja Gaiden
[5:31:17] demon_dandy: It could be fun to play nes zelda
[5:31:20] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @Deepfreeze2k thank you
[5:31:27] spikebomb5: one of the few games that utilized most of the keyboard is dungeon fighter. imagine fighting game inputs keyboard only
[5:31:33] pogotross: @demon_dandy she should play all the Zelda games in order obviously
[5:31:34] PSYCOMMUnist: You'd like the whimsy of SMB3 since it's supposed to be like a stage play
[5:31:44] Navy_Mongoose: sports games are weird
[5:31:44] vtuberacingcorp: Bought you an adapter.
[5:31:59] Navy_Mongoose: no, its attached to boost
[5:32:02] Navy_Mongoose: other way around
[5:32:05] pogotross: they might have tried to match to the SNES controls as well
[5:32:09] Aefen: damn dude ONLY having sports games sounds like torture
[5:32:11] HmmHrmHarumph: u-turn is brake
[5:32:14] Navy_Mongoose: u turn is brake
[5:32:29] mrp0p1nfr3sh: renndogPain
[5:32:30] vtuberacingcorp: I didn't say that, you asked about it
[5:32:33] Senoquese: you could use it for chinchilla of time
[5:32:36] HmmHrmHarumph: Shigeru Miyamoto plays on Starship!
[5:32:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: true!
[5:32:38] Deepfreeze2k: Like WASD wasnt the norm for a long time. You got shit like IMJK as one of the more logical control schemes in the 80s.
[5:32:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: chinchilla of time!
[5:32:41] PSYCOMMUnist: then play it on the original hardware with a CRT, it looks and feels totally different
[5:32:42] spikebomb5: 2000s sports games was where they peaked
[5:32:54] pogotross: that's cool that people can be wrong
[5:32:57] spikebomb5: before the monopolies
[5:33:05] demon_dandy: LOL
[5:33:06] yojamjam: n64 zeldas have pc ports like starship that are way more mature

[5:33:32] Senoquese: eep time ashton51Eep
[5:33:32] Aefen: fighting games you need literally split second reactions, it’s crazy
[5:33:33] SoundBorg_wav: Don't be mad! I was once very bad at it too ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[5:33:33] Navy_Mongoose: Lethal League Blaze when?
[5:33:40] Senoquese: you did really gamer today compared to last time
[5:33:41] Dhekranh: dude, we had 6 buttons and a trigger with a joystick and the dpad unavailable; nowadays we have 8 buttons two triggers, two sticks and a dpad
[5:33:46] Deepfreeze2k: I prefer 80s and 90s sports games over most 2000s sports games honestly. 80s and 90s games dont even try to be realistic and its great.
[5:33:50] vtuberacingcorp: I sent you the manual for star fox in the mod channel so you can study up
[5:34:03] demon_dandy: Wait all this weird button press talk... hop on shenmue girly ashton51Tensai

[5:34:36] Deepfreeze2k: LCD games are neat.
[5:34:37] Dhekranh: those little things were fun
[5:34:37] Envivii: BLAST FROM THE PAST
[5:34:43] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: No that's fair
[5:34:46] Senoquese: did you ever ask your parents for like a psp or something and they got you one of those or were you aware since young you werent getting shit
[5:34:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the switch inputs have delay
[5:34:52] Navy_Mongoose: th joystick c-buttons hurt the fuck out of this game
[5:34:52] bonatide: matoimCopium the hardware the hardware
[5:34:53] Dhekranh: they had 3 modes and they were all the same game
[5:34:57] yojamjam: deadzones, bad mapping, input lag, lower framerate, all of it matters

[5:42:56] KyuuMJ: Did the game exist before you were born?  Then it's Ancient.
[5:43:01] DavidPortnov: Ashton "Arbiter" Marten
[5:43:08] Playmer: @pogotross Sonic 06 is so close to being fun, unfortunately it's unplayable and garbage.
[5:43:16] Woulfgang: For me Xbox 360 being retro is shocking.
[5:43:23] hototari: sonic 06 is the best game ever made
[5:43:26] pogotross: @Playmer There's a fan remake that's supposed to fix it but I still haven't played it
[5:43:32] Aefen: halo 1 is probably the scariest
[5:43:36] Playmer: @pogotross It's not actually the whole game.

[5:44:22] Aefen: she IS ragebaiting
[5:44:29] Senoquese: sonic adventure 2
[5:44:29] Deepfreeze2k: Sonic fans honestly hate 06 more than non-sonic fans.

[5:45:17] olandgren: lol
[5:45:17] PSYCOMMUnist: Sonic 06 has kind of been done to death imo
[5:45:23] X_Rok: PS3 isnt retro because the aethetics of the graphics are very modern. there's no technological limitations to step back to. anything on the PS3 that might actually be considered retro for those reasons are because they're retro throwbacks in their own time
