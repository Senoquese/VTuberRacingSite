[0:21:31] Senoquese: its a mod
[0:21:34] nekobun: I think NoPixel is a GTA roleplay server/mod
[0:21:35] DatBoiVLC: the servers run a specific modpack
[0:21:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: No pixel is just a server built on 5M

[0:22:15] rikkaonline: there were MUDs for rp in the 80s
[0:22:26] TachikomaKURO: Of all the games from the west that ended up being popular in Japan... It had to be. GTA (It stole the thunder to Skyrim ages ago)
[0:22:26] DatBoiVLC: Every once in a while I'll join an RP server for fun in FFXIV

[0:22:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Thats what no pixel is
[0:22:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they ban people that dont rp
[0:22:53] Navy_Mongoose: huh

[0:23:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: and its life time ban
[0:23:04] Senoquese: yeah but you need a huge playerbase for that to work, like in gta, if you just kick everyone out you wont have people ashton51Tehe

[0:23:16] SaltyEike: MUDS are very very very old RPGs
[0:23:17] kyle__senpai: Text based MMORPG basically
[0:23:22] horribleham: Put gamers in the FNAF vr chat room and you will see some role play.

[0:24:33] kyle__senpai: All the great animations like Hyudan or w/e his name was
[0:24:47] TachikomaKURO: Niconico... It has to be... But vtubing adopted. YouTube as soon as Kizuna AI was introduced
[0:24:51] kyle__senpai: That's a name I haven't heard in a long time Becky cruel
[0:25:38] kyle__senpai: Twitch is really its own thing. Just chatting wasn't a thing for years.
[0:25:41] Egmanila: The only thing I associate Niconico with is every clip just being buried under sidescrolling text ashton51Omegalul
[0:25:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Variety streamer came the year before vtubing in the west
[0:25:48] T33bags: i think variety blew up after gaming on youtube started to fall off

[0:26:22] TachikomaKURO: Twitch wasn't always for gaming.
[0:26:42] JTBun: justin tv
[0:26:43] Burr11: twitch used to be justin tv
[0:26:48] Bellophon: Oh god, justin tv
[0:26:52] JTBun: was just a site to stream anything
[0:26:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @JTBun just chatting was added in 2018
[0:26:53] Burr11: people would live stream like their entire day
[0:26:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i just checked
[0:27:06] ApocalypseSC: hi ashton!
[0:27:08] nekobun: Twitch was always for gaming, but Justin.tv its predecessor was more free-form. The creator started it just to stream himself.
[0:27:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: IRL was added in 2017
[0:27:13] T33bags: justin tv was just streaming in general but they leaned into gaming with twitch
[0:27:13] JTBun: @mrp0p1nfr3sh variety doesn't = Just Chatting
[0:27:31] TachikomaKURO: I mean... It was named Justin(dot)TV for a reason and it was basically just chatting
[0:27:34] Mocchiari: I love lets play like Chuggaaconroy videos

[1:48:49] Burr11: no the rockets are making that sound
[1:48:52] nekobun: Standard controls: L1 and R1 cycle weapon pickups, L2 uses item/weapon, R2 uses machine gun, Triangle is turbo, O is brake, X + Square at same time for tight turn, Square alone accelerates

[1:51:24] Kitkattack: I love the old compressed explosion sounds omg
[1:51:44] DatBoiVLC: Oh right, it was twisted metal 3 that had all the dmca music

[1:54:11] demon_dandy: That controller looks kinda funny
[1:54:14] Navy_Mongoose: oh yeah this game would definitely benefit from upscaling
[1:54:17] Burr11: yep
[1:54:31] Senoquese: then internal resolution set to 5x
[1:54:35] Navy_Mongoose: yup, 1-2 and eventually 3
[1:54:35] Senoquese: then enable the first option on PGXP
[1:54:48] Senoquese: if you want theres also widescreen, but im not sure if this game supports it
[1:54:51] Navy_Mongoose: pre analog PSX controller
[1:54:56] nekobun: it is, i think it's one of the last pre-analog PS1 controllers
[1:54:56] Kitkattack: yup no analog sticks
[1:55:01] Senoquese: on the enhacements tab on the bottom
[1:55:10] nekobun: pre-analog games i mean

[1:55:38] Navy_Mongoose: it's the only way to make any sense of it on an LED display
[1:55:38] Ryko404: Now it looks like a PC game instead of a PS1 one. ichimaiaLUL
[1:55:49] Senoquese: this WAS on pc so its what it looked like there
[1:55:50] NOTsumei: Granted, there IS a PC port of TW2
[1:56:01] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You need a faster car
[1:56:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: warthog was bad
[1:56:05] Senoquese: its not a good port tho
[1:56:06] Burr11: lol axel is just a sprite
[1:56:08] Bellophon: Oh, all PS1 models had that warping.
[1:56:12] NOTsumei: Only runs on Win95 and was never re-released
[1:56:15] DatBoiVLC: I used to be a retro game, until a streamer turned on geometry correction
[1:56:19] Navy_Mongoose: it didn't review as well as the PS1 version

[1:56:34] Burr11: ashton51Stare
[1:56:35] Senoquese: geometry correction should remove the jitters but it might not work in this game
[1:56:37] Sgc45: axel used to scare me because for some reason i thought he was a vampire
[1:56:38] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Stare

[1:57:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: doesnt Calypso grant your wish if you win the tourney?
[1:57:11] Burr11: no tight handling is good
[1:57:11] NOTsumei: @mrp0p1nfr3sh Yes
[1:57:11] nekobun: ultra tight means she turns quick
[1:57:17] Navy_Mongoose: her handling is good
[1:57:22] nekobun: He does in the lore yeah
[1:57:24] Navy_Mongoose: but she's fragile af

[1:58:10] NOTsumei: @Bellophon Depends on the game
[1:58:11] anonsama9001: twister is good but you must be adept at entering the shield combo - her armor is just too weak
[1:58:14] Navy_Mongoose: His armor is medium

[1:59:14] anonsama9001: hammerhead's wish is quite compelling

[2:04:51] Burr11: theres the clown
[2:04:55] nekobun: X and Square at the same time to quick turn.
[2:04:57] NOTsumei: A big thing the devs wanted were arenas that, for the most part, felt like they could be happening on your street right now
[2:05:09] ajvark: Ashton be like the kinda combatant to be like "omg haiiii sweet tooth"
[2:05:11] TheAsterite: twister is almost too fast lol
[2:05:14] ajvark: and then get shot point blank

[2:05:45] Navy_Mongoose: Twister's special: Twister
[2:05:50] nekobun: Don't forget you have machine guns on R2 (right trigger) too

[2:06:11] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, better hunt down the health packs
[2:06:30] Navy_Mongoose: native PS1 graphics for this game are ASS
[2:06:44] DatBoiVLC: on PS1, ground collision is kind of a suggestion
[2:07:00] Navy_Mongoose: I was trying to show it off about 15 years ago and my friend said it looked like it should have died another 15 years ago
[2:07:01] Senoquese: the twister special feels like more of an inconvenience LMAO
[2:07:10] Navy_Mongoose: F=Fire
[2:07:24] NOTsumei: Left, Right, Up = Freeze Missile
[2:07:28] demon_dandy: LMAO

[2:08:27] anonsama9001: lol yeah you're so fast you're running into them
[2:08:30] Navy_Mongoose: need to kill all 6 yes
[2:08:30] nekobun: you need to kill all the opponents
[2:08:44] hank112489: The PS1 preventive 3D graphics are neccesary to the progression of games.  That entire generation is like that awkward puberty from 2D gaming to 3D gaming.
[2:08:47] Sgc45: my mom told me killing is wrong
[2:08:48] NOTsumei: Up, Up, Right = Temporary Shield

[2:10:37] NOTsumei: Right, Left, Down = Drops a mine behind you

[2:11:00] Burr11: lol
[2:11:05] NOTsumei: Just bear in mind the AI goes for health too LUL
[2:11:07] Navy_Mongoose: The problem with Twister is she has a good Special, but it requires her to be close range and will usually take more damage than she deals
[2:11:30] Navy_Mongoose: enemies don't heal, you need to hunt down the health drops
[2:11:39] Burr11: lol you killed some dude

[2:13:04] anonsama9001: yeah if you can get a bunch of them in it the damage it delivers increases a bit
[2:13:04] Ryko404: To be fair, Twisted Metal has a learning curve, to put it lightly.

[2:26:10] Bellophon: Think Roadkill is the middle of the road character.
[2:26:19] anonsama9001: @nekobun ah yes that's what i was thinking
[2:26:27] anonsama9001: thumper's special is really good
[2:26:28] NOTsumei: Best Special? Tie between Axel and Mr. Slamm
[2:26:28] Navy_Mongoose: Tight/Intermediate/Sluggish refers to turning
[2:26:55] Ryko404: Warthog's special is pretty good. It's a triple homing rocket attack, I think.
[2:27:08] nekobun: Grasshopper does a big jump and drop I think
[2:27:10] Ryko404: Or at least Warthog's special suited me.
[2:27:11] demon_dandy: LMAO b-but cute girl ashton51Wibble
[2:27:12] nekobun: for her special
[2:27:19] Burr11: shes so cute ashton51Wibble
[2:27:22] Navy_Mongoose: Axel's Special is an immediate AOE that recharges VERY fast, you can basically spam it
[2:27:31] NOTsumei: Outlaw shoots a big AOE electric thing

[2:39:23] NyxDiscordiaTTV: it was a top-down pixel art game
[2:39:37] NyxDiscordiaTTV: technically I didn't even draw the cars lol. it was a friend of mine
[2:40:26] NOTsumei: So you know that big electrical tower on the map? The lightning spawns from that. Anyone near it takes damage

[2:47:20] NOTsumei: The Freeze Missile is kinda the ability you need to keep pace
[2:47:35] NOTsumei: 3's physics are borked
[2:47:43] NyxDiscordiaTTV: https://clips.twitch.tv/DarkSpineyPresidentArgieB8-dp61LNEwABo0sPMg

[2:48:11] DatBoiVLC: @Senoquese piapiuGun
[2:48:43] NOTsumei: I think you'd get a kick out of Small Brawl. It's an alternate take where they're all kids with RC vehicles

[2:49:29] NOTsumei: Always be firing the machine guns

[2:50:17] NOTsumei: Each level has destructible stuff. Paris and New York are the most famous in this game for it
[2:50:33] TachikomaKURO: The best one of the bunch? It has to be Twisted Metal Black
[2:50:33] NOTsumei: The bomb bounces around for a bit then explodes

[2:51:07] NOTsumei: Twisted Metal Black is an amazing game, but the AI can be far more difficult than this
[2:51:28] nekobun: the reboot on PS3 was pretty decent
[2:51:39] Navy_Mongoose: Power Missile does more damage

[2:54:37] ReyJaggy: ashton51Wibble

[2:56:13] TheAsterite: if only ashton had a machine gun ashton51Sadcheer
[2:56:19] NOTsumei: Yep. The lore varies, but the comic says he got his power from Satan in exchange for creating carnage and sending more souls to hell since Satan I guess loves destructiond derbies
[2:56:20] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Sadcheer
[2:56:30] Navy_Mongoose: lizard blink

[2:56:57] DatBoiVLC: yeah outlaw's AOE special is broken
[2:57:14] Navy_Mongoose: I think the only "good" endings in this game are really really sad
[2:57:17] nekobun: outlaw is incredibly annoying
[2:57:22] NOTsumei: The manual also explains "Combos", but they boil down to "Use Freeze Missile, and hit with X attack"
[2:57:26] nekobun: but i mean she is a cop
[2:57:52] NyxDiscordiaTTV: I posted a perfectly cut version of that clip in the Discord lol

[2:58:43] Navy_Mongoose: she just bumped him for the kill

[2:59:08] nekobun: i think the jump does damage if she lands on you but yeah her special sucks
[2:59:46] Navy_Mongoose: Grasshopper is for the real masochists in this game

[3:02:14] NOTsumei: It's a special input. Left, Right, Up
[3:02:15] anonsama9001: freeze is left right up

[3:09:27] Navy_Mongoose: <>^ for freeze
[3:09:51] Senoquese: thats too much cheating tho i think
[3:09:53] nekobun: which code were you looking for?
[3:10:04] NOTsumei: Looks like they messed the code up on GameFaqs LUL
[3:10:11] nekobun: Hold R2 - Up Down Left Right Right Left Down up
[3:10:13] Blazemage2001: hello peeps

[3:10:18] Senoquese: since w god mode theres no point to playing ashton51Tehe the ai will just kill each other
[3:10:39] nekobun: you can turn eternal life off by doing the code again I think
[3:11:22] nekobun: Then Mega Machine gun was the R2 only code I threw in there a minute ago
[3:11:54] Navy_Mongoose: if you ahve green bar then you can use specials, but the inputs are a little finnicky
[3:11:54] nekobun: Hold R2 - U D L R R L D U
[3:12:15] NOTsumei: To be fair, Eternal Life and Mega Machine Gun are 1 button apart LUL

[3:13:55] Navy_Mongoose: holy shit thumper's special does a lot of damage
[3:13:59] NOTsumei: I wanna check out Season 2 since that will actually have the Tournament
[3:14:11] nekobun: Samoa Joe hams it up as Sweet Tooth though, he at least had a good time. Shame they got Will Arnett to dub over him.
[3:14:17] Senoquese: oh wow theres a code to trade your weapons for health
[3:14:27] nekobun: It actually tries really well to build a world on the limited source material, but it tries to be too clever
[3:14:27] KingZut: i havent seen it but im betting "yes" to all 3 parts lol
[3:14:34] nekobun: Whedonitis re: the writing
[3:14:44] nekobun: and a lot of bad pacing
[3:14:53] Navy_Mongoose: you at least have a bunch of health pickups
[3:14:55] Blazemage2001: the sound effects are so cheesey lmao
[3:14:59] laserburn501: absolutely, acute whedonitis
[3:15:12] Senoquese: theres a combo to trade your weapons for bonus health but idk how much it gives

[3:15:32] nekobun: yeah you'r eholding up solidly
[3:15:43] Navy_Mongoose: RIP Grasshopper
[3:15:43] NOTsumei: @Senoquese I think it depends on how many of each weapon you have
[3:15:54] nekobun: if nothing else you gotta check out holland before the end of the stream
[3:15:58] Senoquese: @NOTsumei makes sense
[3:16:05] Navy_Mongoose: yeah stay the hell away from Thumper
