[2:56:52] Returner7: I'm fairly certain that was intentional
[2:56:56] Kitkattack: finding meaning in your life?
[2:57:04] GManx0: That is just human nature

[2:58:52] timebound_timmy: I'm that way too
[2:58:55] Kitkattack: do you want to watch the alternate endings
[2:59:03] JaAmfan: we can meet in the middle and stare at raiden's ass
[2:59:07] nimvus: hey... dont worry about us going 'kojima', honest!
[2:59:11] ReyJaggy: pretty boy raiden
[2:59:21] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Chinema
[2:59:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: howd you like it?
[2:59:29] ScarletRook: No it's just Kojima's writing style so I understand what you're talking about though
[2:59:35] Navy_Mongoose: Recorded at Salami Studios? No wonder the dialogue was so hammy
[2:59:50] JaAmfan: ah, a foxhound referenc
[2:59:51] nimvus: i just came here has it gotten bad
[3:00:04] peachuuuu: pay attention to the sweet sax solo coming up
[3:00:17] JTBun: we arent getting on you, it's fine jsghkdfhgkdf
[3:00:18] T33bags: dog pile this -> ashton51Dumpy
[3:00:20] Navy_Mongoose: well yeah, we kind of have no idea what you're saying
[3:00:23] Senoquese: i dont think people were saying that
[3:00:24] ghost_of_asahi: people are dogpiling
[3:00:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yeah i just am glad you played it
[3:00:26] timebound_timmy: That just mean if you keep talking theyll get more confused
[3:00:26] JaAmfan: 20 years to dwell on one game is a long time
[3:00:30] timebound_timmy: It will be fun
[3:00:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: whatever you took from it im glad you even tried it out
[3:00:39] Kitkattack: ZOE
[3:00:44] demon_dandy: now were enemies üôÑ
[3:00:47] MeadowAtLast: when you say male fantasy i think it implies to ppl a certain psychosexual thing and tahts why ppl were confused idk, especially when u compared it to a twitter pregnancy fetishist
[3:00:52] GManx0: You have an idea and constantly say "NEvermind" THo
[3:00:55] Returner7: High Speed Robot Action!!
[3:00:56] Navy_Mongoose: oh wait, Scott Dolph isn't a MGS character I guess
[3:01:20] MeadowAtLast: oh okay right yeah
[3:01:20] JTBun: ICANT
[3:01:28] nimvus: no no no no continue
[3:01:29] GManx0: How did you connect it like that
[3:01:33] JaAmfan: he was as an unnamed hostage
[3:01:34] nimvus: i want to hear you out
[3:01:36] Senoquese: i think most people do want to understand what you mean we just dont get it
[3:01:40] Navy_Mongoose: I mean for some reason I thought that was Fortune's dad's name
[3:01:41] ScarletRook: Yeah its hard to articulate your point on the spot
[3:01:41] Kitkattack: Snake dismisses the gene thing remember, it's not the only thing that matters.
[3:01:47] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:01:58] Navy_Mongoose: @GManx0 because this is just like Zapper: One Wicked Cricket
[3:02:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I get what ashtons talking about.
[3:02:11] peachuuuu: i get what u mean ashton
[3:02:18] timebound_timmy: I need the tragic genes and word salad
[3:02:21] peachuuuu: i dont think i agree but i see where you coming from
[3:02:22] JTBun: girl ICANT no one is mad at you
[3:02:25] JaAmfan: ok now for the skateboarding minigame
[3:02:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I think people are just being defensive and snapping before you get your point across.
[3:02:33] Kitkattack: just ask questions lol if you want anything to be clearer
[3:02:34] demon_dandy: Tbh i get the pregnancy artist connection ICANT
[3:02:35] GManx0: You stop your point halfway tho. Have a mangled point and go from there
[3:02:57] peachuuuu: explain it to me snake.... nnghhhrhh
[3:03:00] mrp0p1nfr3sh: renndogHappi
[3:03:10] ReyJaggy: Pass on dez

[3:03:15] T33bags: passing down my jeans they‚Äôre Levi‚Äôs
[3:03:21] Senoquese: @T33bags +2
[3:03:22] faizdanyal: Ducks!?
[3:03:26] peachuuuu: mgs2 discourse sucks so bad even though snake straight up TELLS you whats going on here
[3:03:32] mrjnumber1: Sorry snake the digital age didn't go so well
[3:03:36] demon_dandy: The fucking bull ashton51Pog
[3:03:39] faizdanyal: Wowwww is this Metal Gear or this turn into a PSA?
[3:03:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Pre 9/11 content is so good
[3:03:45] faizdanyal: Or Documentary?
[3:03:48] MeadowAtLast: @peachuuuu it is very funny that ppl act like the game is confusing just because it has a lot of proper nouns. it is thematically very straightforward
[3:03:49] DatBoiVLC: I actually think that this game is so profound that you can't possibly understand it without it being a part of your memetic understanding of the world for a few years ashton51Nerd Kappa
[3:03:58] nimvus: love that snake speech
[3:04:01] Oceanbones: @mrp0p1nfr3sh true
[3:04:02] faizdanyal: Clap
[3:04:05] Navy_Mongoose: Anyway Ashton, here's how MGS2 is connected to 9/11.....
[3:04:05] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh 9/11 ruined media (this was also after 9/11)
[3:04:09] DatBoiVLC: Clap
[3:04:12] Kitkattack: fiyuPOINT
[3:04:15] T33bags: after after credits scene LMAOOOOOOOO
[3:04:15] konrad_s1: Passing down my üëñ
[3:04:18] peachuuuu: its post modern presentation just confuses people who dont wanna listen to snake lmao
[3:04:29] Senoquese: wtff ashton martens in that list ashton51Despair
[3:04:30] faizdanyal: MGS3 teaseeeee

[3:04:37] demon_dandy: CAUGHT their name... vtuberacing
[3:04:39] JTBun: wow

[3:04:43] Senoquese: Chinema
[3:04:46] JTBun: Chinema
[3:04:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: CAUGHT
[3:04:53] peachuuuu: Chinema
[3:04:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Chinema
[3:04:58] demon_dandy: Chinema
[3:05:04] nimvus: Chinema
[3:05:05] DatBoiVLC: Chinema
[3:05:06] resetcrumpets: Chinema
[3:05:08] faizdanyal: 17 hours. Insane.
[3:05:12] ReyJaggy: Cinema
[3:05:30] Navy_Mongoose: considering the cutscenes, probably very fast
[3:05:31] Senoquese: average time to beat is 13 to 18, you did well
[3:05:34] GManx0: I mean, who would he pass it to
[3:05:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese This was developed before 9/11 so its still pre 9/11 content
[3:05:39] peachuuuu: i think it meant to be a parallel to snake
[3:05:40] mrjnumber1: No no you did great
[3:05:46] timebound_timmy: I think its about all kinds of information inl. genes.
[3:05:51] Navy_Mongoose: his unborn son?
[3:05:51] T33bags: butt baby
[3:05:55] faizdanyal: And I guess onto the next MGS.
[3:05:57] Navy_Mongoose: Rose is pregnant, remember?
[3:06:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: chinchihappi
[3:06:16] JTBun: yeah
[3:06:18] ReyJaggy: I think it is just that
[3:06:23] peachuuuu: i get what u mean
[3:06:24] nimvus: oh nooooo ads
[3:06:27] demon_dandy: I feel that ashton51Tehe
[3:06:35] nimvus: i wanted to hear what she had to say henemiWeh
[3:06:35] mrp0p1nfr3sh: DIESOFCHILLA im in ads
[3:06:40] T33bags: ADTIME
[3:06:44] Senoquese: ADTIME
[3:06:47] rikkaonline: i think people saying "kojima" are saying you understand it
[3:06:52] Senoquese: ^^
[3:06:54] demon_dandy: speak your truth tbh
[3:06:54] mrjnumber1: Gamers are just intensely stupid dw abt it
[3:06:58] JTBun: yes
[3:07:03] Returner7: works better on a second playthrough imo
[3:07:05] Kitkattack: bro that is not an emote now om
[3:07:06] peachuuuu: the discourse abotu this game sucks
[3:07:07] Kitkattack: ADTIME
[3:07:22] JTBun: You come to understand why we say "That's just kojima" the more you play his games
[3:07:25] JaAmfan: @peachuuuu ppl definitely overblow how many ppl hated raiden
[3:07:30] ReyJaggy: no no dont worry
[3:07:36] demon_dandy: LOLLLLLLL
[3:07:37] peachuuuu: its post modern presentation is purposefully obtuse despite the game ending with snake laying it all out for you
[3:07:39] Navy_Mongoose: I think you were articulating it well until you brought up twitter pregnancy fetish
[3:07:46] Kitkattack: did you like raiden in the end?
[3:07:51] T33bags: he wants you to write poetry duh ashton
[3:07:53] ghost_of_asahi: its a goofy ass game with some goofy ass writing but the message is actually quite serious and deep i guess
[3:08:03] ReyJaggy: this was the same reaction nemimi had to mgs3 so you are valid
[3:08:04] Senoquese: i cant believe raidens real name is marten
[3:08:10] Navy_Mongoose: btw Raiden>Snake
[3:08:11] JTBun: @Senoquese LMAo
[3:08:30] demon_dandy: A little patronizing?
[3:08:43] Kitkattack: like what?
[3:08:44] rikkaonline: deep for freshman level philosophy?
[3:08:57] Navy_Mongoose: right, I think it's because media like this wasn't as widespread back then, this was incredibly profound at the time
[3:08:58] DatBoiVLC: its an overblown and overcomplicated story about really simple themes
[3:09:01] ghost_of_asahi: It's on the nose for sure
[3:09:03] JaAmfan: its a basic worldview with a soap opera stapled to it
[3:09:09] Senoquese: yeah i think thats the way kojima likes to write. hes not super deep he just likes to have fun with deep topics
[3:09:09] MeadowAtLast: it is a video game story and the bar is very low
[3:09:17] MeadowAtLast: @Navy_Mongoose its more about games than media in general
[3:09:22] GManx0: Kojima is David Cage but good
[3:09:25] demon_dandy: LOLLLLL
[3:09:26] peachuuuu: yah you gotta remember this was a triple A video game in 2001
[3:09:40] MeadowAtLast: @GManx0 a fundamental element of david cage is that he is awful. you cant say taht
[3:09:40] Returner7: we played these games when we were 13 ashton51Pathetic ashton51Pathetic ashton51Pathetic
[3:09:41] DatBoiVLC: @DatBoiVLC and this is still one of my favorite games of all time, this said
[3:09:45] Lorothol: Raiden "finding himself" is just one part of the end.
[3:09:59] T33bags: yeah 9/11 is like last year for Kojima here
[3:10:02] Kitkattack: I mean if there wasn't a lot more monologuing it wouldn't be so ham-fisted but that's just kojima's action movie style
[3:10:08] demon_dandy: I mean i get what youre putting down ashton51Tehe
[3:10:14] ghost_of_asahi: I never thought it was that profound. I just liked all the killing.
[3:10:18] nimvus: i dont think 13 year olds would really 'get' this tho
[3:10:31] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, kids at the time hated this and didn't understand any of it
[3:10:35] Senoquese: i agree with you, its just silly you compare things to your current experience vs how media was when it released ashton51Omega
[3:10:37] peachuuuu: i wouldnt have got this at 13 lol
[3:10:41] Kitkattack: kid me barely understood this
[3:10:42] rikkaonline: when youre deciding between this and cod, itll make you think
[3:10:44] JTBun: I mean tbf, no other games have messages like this until the MGS series, so it was crazy
[3:10:45] Navy_Mongoose: that's why the internet being censored thing was so confusing in 2001
[3:10:52] GManx0: People have joined the military cause they played MGS as Kids
[3:10:58] Navy_Mongoose: and they especially hated Raiden
[3:11:03] MeadowAtLast: i bet the internet shit was really confusing in 2001, cause its really easy to understand in hindsight
[3:11:08] peachuuuu: you might just be locked in
[3:11:08] DatBoiVLC: Kojima was so far ahead of his time with this specific messaging too
[3:11:13] demon_dandy: When the media got themes and tropes
[3:11:18] Kitkattack: oh people hated raiden out the gate yeeee fiyuNOD
[3:11:35] peachuuuu: LMAO
[3:11:43] Returner7: huh? LOL
[3:11:44] nimvus: yeah???
[3:11:47] ghost_of_asahi: hahahaha
[3:11:47] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:11:49] timebound_timmy: Fascinating
[3:11:54] DatBoiVLC: Chew
[3:11:58] GManx0: Ego Death Chilla
[3:12:04] donothang: yeah its too bad most games rnt as deep as this
[3:12:07] T33bags: 95 cheese wheels ate
[3:12:17] Kitkattack: erm huh, second consciousness dawning?
[3:12:23] peachuuuu: is it time we talk about testosterones effect on the body
[3:12:40] keydget: Farter
[3:12:43] Navy_Mongoose: now you can replay it to see the MArines in their pantsu
[3:12:48] donothang: sowwy ashton i gotta go
[3:12:48] DatBoiVLC: this was really really bleeding edge for 2001, there wasn't a lot of counter authority narrative in western gaming at the time
[3:12:52] donothang: wuv u bye bye
[3:12:53] Senoquese: @DatBoiVLC this
[3:12:55] Senoquese: i just think the average person back then did not have the media with the kind of writing youre used to
[3:13:03] GManx0: Totally understandable, but i dont think we were that agresive towards your idea
[3:13:05] Kitkattack: @DatBoiVLC so ground breaking
[3:13:18] ReyJaggy: time to boot mgs3 to understand everything we just experienced Clueless
[3:13:29] nimvus: yeah the topics covered in this game werent really common talking points back then
[3:13:35] demon_dandy: I think theres more to break down on this games themes but the stuff they broadly present feels a cliche or simplistic to end on ashton51Tehe
[3:13:37] Senoquese: gotta relate to how media was back then and not to your current experiences, like saying portal 2 had dated humor ashton51Omega
[3:13:39] JaAmfan: @DatBoiVLC i got a cardboard box full of ps1 jrpgs for you
[3:13:45] peachuuuu: you also gotta remmeber that guys just natually get a different life experience that doesnt permit this kinda introspection socially, espically in the early 2000s
[3:13:51] JTBun: yeah back when the MGS games were first coming out, these types of narratives were never a thing before it
[3:13:52] T33bags: kojima is a movie director stuck in the gaming industry making games for boys that were buying this game for the shooting LMAOOOO
[3:14:00] DatBoiVLC: @JaAmfan that's my point, this shit was not in action games
[3:14:11] Kitkattack: games didn't really strong through points you have to remember, they were just little adventures
[3:14:16] Returner7: yeah western media landscape back then was very much less deep
[3:14:31] GManx0: Sigma Male mindset
[3:14:40] Lorothol: There was no way the game could explore Raiden's personality and thoughts/feelings in time with everything else going on is the thing.
[3:14:57] GManx0: It cant be a movie
[3:15:04] timebound_timmy: I could see that
[3:15:10] MeadowAtLast: when ppl say taht kojima just wants to make movies i think theyre totally wrong
[3:15:12] peachuuuu: the game even makes fun of the fact that you need snake to tell you
[3:15:15] ghost_of_asahi: People weren't really expecting this at the time. We just wanted another cool ass, campy action game where you play as Snake again
[3:15:20] MeadowAtLast: he's so good at making games and he obviously loves making games
[3:15:23] Kitkattack: him being a vr baby is pretty significant though
[3:15:25] demon_dandy: it kinda pmo when people say that kojima just wants to make movies
[3:15:30] peachuuuu: the ai does in the last cutscene
[3:15:30] DatBoiVLC: yep, when I was 14 it was this game and Donnie Darko for a lot of dudes just figuring out that guys have feelings worth exploring too
[3:15:47] GManx0: Ashton, people are dumb. Sometimes looking at the camera and spilling the core theme of the game is not enough
[3:16:10] Senoquese: i dont think at this time he wanted to make ultra deep things i think he just likes to mess around with those deep topics but also have stupid mindless fun
[3:16:12] timebound_timmy: I honestly used to think Kojima was being funny by being so heavy handed with it. But now. . . eh. . .
[3:16:33] beefdrizzle: i mean i think the find yourself ending isn't too infantilizing when u take it along with everything, it's encouraging you to find your own beliefs and what's important to u and not listen to political institutions that are just tryna control u
[3:17:10] nimvus: its pretty blunt about the messaging huh
[3:17:10] ghost_of_asahi: It is silly
[3:17:19] timebound_timmy: How did it compare to first one?
[3:17:19] JTBun: did you like this game more than the first?
[3:17:23] ReyJaggy: It do be silly
[3:17:26] beefdrizzle: the music is a lil like swelling for sure it does give it like didney happy kinda vibe hehe
[3:17:34] Senoquese: its such a huge technological overhaul
[3:17:39] peachuuuu: snake straight up is kojima talking btw. he says out loud "i know you didnt get many choices this time"
[3:17:46] ghost_of_asahi: All the metal gear games are silly like that. They all cant help but spell everything out for you
[3:17:49] Navy_Mongoose: the boss music was awesome though
[3:17:55] GManx0: She just likes Fatman cause of the Rollers
[3:18:09] demon_dandy: I think its funny how different boss fight you vs regular gameplay you is ashton51Omegalul
[3:18:16] peachuuuu: yeah but its a banger track
[3:18:17] Senoquese: @demon_dandy ashton51Tehe
[3:18:19] JaAmfan: I like how tightly paced MGS1 is and slightly prefer its moment to moment gameplay
[3:18:27] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, Dead Cell's theme
[3:18:36] beefdrizzle: i will always respect a guy who knows how to put down a meal
[3:18:48] peachuuuu: 2 is my favourite mgs by far personally
[3:18:57] Navy_Mongoose: it is goofy how often they have to codec cutscene in this though
[3:19:08] T33bags: it‚Äôs ok the aura moments only become more and more common
[3:19:28] demon_dandy: We dont worry about all that Classic
[3:19:31] JaAmfan: a codec call is just one level removed from a family guy cutaway gag
[3:19:42] peachuuuu: thats all very intentional kojima loves schlocky movies
[3:20:11] Senoquese: ashton51Love
[3:20:13] GManx0: You alright?
[3:20:18] peachuuuu: let it ruminate
[3:20:20] ghost_of_asahi: thats the stupidest thing about metal gear games. But its also why we love them. They take themselves so seriously
[3:20:26] peachuuuu: i kinda get where you were going
[3:20:28] demon_dandy: I got what you were putting down
[3:20:32] Kitkattack: you should link that artist then we'll understand ashton51Noted
[3:20:33] MeadowAtLast: tbh i find the snake speech touching as a person who cannot have children lol
[3:20:38] beefdrizzle: brain workin well enough to smack solidus yessir ashton51Kneel
[3:20:50] GManx0: But Raiden doesnt believe in himself
[3:20:51] ReyJaggy: Kojima predicted AI girlfriends ashton51OGEY
[3:21:01] T33bags: he‚Äôs saying you should write poetry Ashton
[3:21:10] T33bags: you specifically
[3:21:18] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:21:25] beefdrizzle: yeh there's actually a lot of ppl telling certain ppl to not pass down their genes and beliefs
[3:21:31] beefdrizzle: big american problem
[3:21:43] T33bags: kinda
[3:21:46] rikkaonline: ashton51Stare
[3:21:51] ghost_of_asahi: thats a world history problem
[3:21:52] Senoquese: ashton51Hey
[3:21:53] Kitkattack: oh boy
[3:21:55] ghost_of_asahi: its why we have wars
[3:22:15] beefdrizzle: ty ashton!!!
[3:22:22] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:22:23] GManx0: I think that is more about Raiden being a child soldier. A Monster for so long that he cant see that
[3:22:26] peachuuuu: it feels unattainable for a lot of guys atm i think
[3:23:06] rikkaonline: i dont think men needed to be told that in 2001
[3:23:13] Navy_Mongoose: Raiden relates directly to fans of MGS2
[3:23:26] Navy_Mongoose: MGS1*
[3:23:27] timebound_timmy: I like hearing people work things out live.
[3:23:33] ReyJaggy: Oh boy, mgs3 is just for you then lol
[3:23:36] rikkaonline: ashton51Pathetic
[3:23:57] Senoquese: im not a good person üôÑ
[3:24:01] Kitkattack: for the most part ashton51Blush
[3:24:10] demon_dandy: Were literally enemies rn üôÑ
[3:24:12] Kitkattack: she's so backhanded damn
[3:24:15] peachuuuu: its ok kojima gives up the subtext for the next one
[3:24:28] GManx0: We are not yelling at you yet you think we are. Just like we might not think we will be wife havers yet we could be
[3:24:34] demon_dandy: I was agreein with you on everythin tbh

[3:34:23] MeadowAtLast: he was forced to eat concrete and then they turned him into concrete
[3:34:27] Bird_toe: I don't think mgs2 really end on a high ending. Raiden was question whether he slept with his imagination like 10 minutes before the end
[3:34:29] JaAmfan: he gets to have better bossfights later dw
[3:34:54] GManx0: It was hopeful.
[3:35:05] Senoquese: raiden was the friends we made along the metal gear
[3:35:30] peachuuuu: i think thats a bit of a undersell of the themes but yeah it ends hopeful despite his shit siutation

[3:36:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Thats why hes into pop culture of the 80s and 90s and now
[3:36:34] ReyJaggy: mgs would have benifited from a nier esque type of ending where you need to replay the game to get a bit more of the ending to understand and get the true ending
[3:36:39] Kitkattack: she thinks about 9/11 regularly om
[3:36:42] Senoquese: shes sooo coddled in her warm chilla cage with a water bottle ashton51Wibble
[3:36:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese true

[3:37:52] Lorothol: :)
[3:37:56] InsaneLoke: in the parking garage yeah
[3:37:58] InsaneLoke: it was minor
[3:38:00] GManx0: It wasnt destroyed
[3:38:05] rikkaonline: it was just a bomb in the basement, not major damage
[3:38:06] Kitkattack: there were sarin attacks too
[3:38:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: This game was released in november 2001. so it couldnt have been THAT different. thats just 2 months yall
