[0:47:33] ChessCatUWU: I get that though. This track feels super off.
[0:47:44] demon_dandy: this shit looks like the battle pass
[0:48:08] mushi_buns: theres a button for that I think?
[0:48:12] Megaket: Oh you can press R to do the bounce stuff
[0:48:18] Trent7004: Looks like a fall guys map, or a Fortnite event
[0:48:23] mushi_buns: try the drift button when in the air?
[0:48:44] ChessCatUWU: When you drift, you bounce before, and it can be registered as a trick.
[0:48:45] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog its ash time

[0:51:18] Trent7004: I thought u we’re gonna stream along with him
[0:51:49] Trent7004: Understandable
[0:52:05] demon_dandy: if you hold the item button with the banana and some items, you hold it behind you i think
[0:52:20] KosLaniakea: its also like whenever you watch a movie at a different theatre, it doesnt really feel the same
[0:52:27] Trent7004: @demon_dandy yeah u do

[0:52:56] TheAsterite: !fc
[0:53:07] Sonicb00m111: Item economy such a big thing in this game
[0:53:29] ChessCatUWU: Since we're talking about tricks and stuff, do you know about braking while drifting?
[0:53:45] Megaket: Yeah and when you're at the top you basically only get defensive items/coins
[0:53:47] mushi_buns: hehe
[0:53:51] supra_mike: I remember "drifting" irl in highschool a friend of mine had his mom's VW beetle and we would have like 6 people in it, put the parking brake on with plastic lunch trays under the rear wheels
[0:53:53] hailtheprophet: Yea I won’t see people getting stars in first
[0:54:00] demon_dandy: the item economy bubble ashton51Tensai
[0:54:10] ドリームキャスト: drifting irl looks so cool
[0:54:18] ChessCatUWU: When you drift on fast ccs, you can tap the break button while drifting to help you make tighter turns.
[0:54:27] lyndotheog: hi there everyone how's it going
[0:54:32] ChessCatUWU: yeah b
[0:54:33] TheAsterite: yeah b
[0:54:36] TheAnglerCh: holding green shels and bananas behind you is a good trick
[0:54:37] Returner7: I don't play the meta characters, just the ones that look cool to me LOL!
[0:54:43] demon_dandy: that sounds crack up supra mike lmaooo

[0:55:32] Trent7004: We accelerate we do NOT decelerate
[0:55:54] Megaket: Yeah there's an auto-accelerate setting
[0:56:14] demon_dandy: just gotta stick your front wheels into the gutter to drift ashton51Tensai
[0:56:28] Sonicb00m111: It hits anyone as it travels along the track to first place
[0:56:39] Sonicb00m111: apriShake
[0:56:44] demon_dandy: the WHAT ashton51Bork
[0:56:45] TheAnglerCh: coquiOGEY

[0:57:00] Trent7004: Uhhhhhh WHATUSAY
[0:57:06] supra_mike: @demon_dandy it was actually a pretty big thing back when I was in school we called it tray skidding, idk if it's still a thing with todays more strict school rules
[0:57:19] mushi_buns: B is break and X also lets you look back

[0:57:50] ChessCatUWU: If you want to turn off auto accelerate, you can press +/- in the kart select.
[0:57:57] lyndotheog: how's everyone doing today
[0:57:57] supra_mike: I do notice the same school I went to 10 years ago no longer has. parking lot covered in skidmarks
[0:58:02] hailtheprophet: Idk how much longer my switch is gonna last
[0:58:02] niertlwal: therock_eyebrow.gif

[0:58:49] Trent7004: One of my favorite courses
[0:59:07] supra_mike: of if you missed the context the highschool I went to was a scene of after school parking lot drifting shenanigans
[0:59:48] Trent7004: The thing I had a dream bout being in a Mario kart race.
[0:59:58] demon_dandy: they put food trays on their tires, thatd be sick to try
[1:00:21] TheAsterite: it's hard, but very fun
[1:00:30] TheAsterite: it's way better if you have some time trial practice

[1:09:45] Megaket: The code that is written worked for me so it should be good
[1:09:45] ChessCatUWU: That explains why it looked like the car was chasing the boat.
[1:09:50] hailtheprophet: Wii sports?

[1:12:05] TheAnglerCh: my childhood...
[1:12:06] hailtheprophet: Yeah this race goes by fast
[1:12:25] ChessCatUWU: Small hint in case you weren't aware, using a boost with mushrooms or a star makes you fast enough to go over grass and stuff.
[1:12:28] PastaThief911: my cats watching the stream
[1:12:28] Trent7004: It’s cause ur the race queen

[1:12:54] TheAnglerCh: Mario Kart 64, Double Dash, and DS are fun
[1:12:55] mushi_buns: at the time it was
[1:12:57] Sonicb00m111: You could back in the day
[1:12:59] TheAnglerCh: you might be able too
[1:13:03] mushi_buns: but I think the online is down
[1:13:04] demon_dandy: well the thing about the 3ds-
[1:13:04] PolyChromaMeta: polyalToast
[1:13:05] skiedeagle: remember how I said that it opened up another lobby when I opened up the code. I tried again a few minutes later and I was already spectating you guys. so this is the right code
[1:13:13] Sonicb00m111: Dunno about now, the services are dead I think
[1:13:17] ChessCatUWU: There has to be some way. There's lots of stuff for old Mario Kart games online.
[1:13:18] TheAnglerCh: I think you can use Parsec to play online with emulators
[1:13:20] Trent7004: Ima stay up late even tho I won’t get enough sleep for school
[1:13:36] Trent7004: NO!
[1:13:44] hailtheprophet: Yep
