[1:00:20] Returner7: a few en talents are VAs as well
[1:00:20] dax812: Didn't Armin's english VA just reveal their vtuber channel?
[1:00:32] Rayterni: @Kitkattack lots of vtubers are also voice actors.
[1:00:38] T33bags: theres vtubers that were seiyuu before too anyways right
[1:00:48] InsaneLoke: vtubing is basically being a voice actor

[1:01:29] InsaneLoke: well theres a lot more that goes into vocal performance as a vtuber than facetubing by default
[1:01:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: If we need a blonde elf then we should call ashton. ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish

[1:03:05] Burr11: lol yeah ashton51Tehe
[1:03:10] InsaneLoke: well, the season just started
[1:03:14] demon_dandy: i couldnt get through the first chapter...
[1:03:19] kyle__senpai: I mean, I would listen in an anime
[1:03:24] Kitkattack: my friend is crazy about that show, but then again there's few isekai's he doesn't love
[1:03:24] Burr11: yeah but people add it before the season starts
[1:03:29] Burr11: so it does mean it's popular
[1:03:33] dax812: Ashton got the spunky best friend character voice
[1:03:36] demon_dandy: You have a nice yappin voice ashton51Tensai
[1:03:38] Egmanila: ashton51Pop ashton51Pop ashton51Pop

[1:03:54] Returner7: you have a nice voice Race Queen! ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[1:04:04] godlessweeb: You'd be the anime girl in roller skates but is never seen skating
[1:04:09] InsaneLoke: ashton 51 cheer
[1:04:09] Burr11: i gotta be honest Solo Leveling sure feels super overhyped after two episodes but the over the top edginess is pretty funny
[1:04:12] Returner7: LAMOOOOO
[1:04:14] Rayterni: o.o
[1:04:17] T33bags: you just have to really take it seriously to do it well but i think you take singing more seriously which is why you have been doing stuff to make your singing better (i.e. the thing with tightening your abdomen when singing)
[1:04:17] JTBun: LMAO
[1:04:18] demon_dandy: Hes here to stay LMAO
[1:04:25] Bellophon: The manhwa for Solo Leveling had some really good art.
[1:04:34] Kitkattack: jeez I'm cold, need a sweater n some tea brb ashton51Bongo
[1:04:44] kyle__senpai: @bellophon Korean comics go hard
[1:04:59] demon_dandy: @burr11 its like that other fighting highschool manwha that got hyped
[1:05:02] ReyJaggy: Korean novel too right? Not sure
[1:05:08] Burr11: tower of god or whatever
[1:05:19] ReyJaggy: I always drop korean manwhas
[1:05:24] Bellophon: @ReyJaggy Yeah, think it went novel -> manhwa -> anime
[1:05:26] Burr11: yeah it feels so much like the other korean manwhas
[1:05:26] rikkaonline: its at least kind of new, but the girl is so obnoxious
[1:05:29] dax812: Tower of God anime wasn't bad but i feel like nobody watched it
[1:05:42] Returner7: yeah idk manwha have been getting pretty trope-y lately
[1:05:46] Burr11: it's very simplistic power fantasy shit
[1:05:48] demon_dandy: People really fw solo leveling but i just didnt fw it ashton51Tehe
[1:06:04] Bellophon: Solo Leveling's writing was pretty generic, but the art was what carried the series.
[1:06:17] demon_dandy: I like the flat coloring
[1:06:25] kyle__senpai: Weird to watch an adaptation from two countries that historically hate each other
[1:06:31] Burr11: yes
[1:06:33] rikkaonline: all the names are korean
[1:06:35] Burr11: and they all have korean names
[1:06:38] demon_dandy: Oh yeahhh
[1:06:42] JTBun: did i see something named H-goon?
[1:06:45] behoimii: korean kirito
[1:06:48] Bellophon: A-1 getting this kinda curses it to be mid at best.
[1:06:55] demon_dandy: LMAO jtbun
[1:06:57] Burr11: i'm glad they're at least giving it a respectful adaptation
[1:07:22] godlessweeb: I always have the impression of manhwa anime being "look at our MC isn't he cool, he's god, there's no conflict but he does have sick one liners"
[1:07:28] Burr11: ^
[1:07:39] Returner7: I'd expect most manwha adaptations are animated in Korea???
[1:07:41] JTBun: we H-Gooning?
[1:07:45] Rayterni: where do i know this animation studio from
[1:07:47] InsaneLoke: it sure is weird to watch an anime
[1:07:52] Rayterni: hmm
[1:08:01] kyle__senpai: H-Goon is a beautiful name
[1:08:03] Burr11: uh, SAO for one lol
[1:08:05] hamonmint: rynxNuggie
[1:08:18] Bellophon: Honestly, the best "japan and other country collaborating to make something" series is Thunderbolt Fantasy.
[1:08:34] ryokopanic: going to anime cons in korea is weird
[1:08:37] kyle__senpai: Does Korea still do all the in-betweens for all cartoons ever?
[1:08:37] Burr11: yeah its weird how they lean on JP VAs
[1:08:39] Returner7: hang on a lot of studios do subcontract to Korea though
[1:08:41] StreamElements: Up your streaming game with Elgato! From their 4K60 Pro Capture Card to their Stream Deck, I use their products every single stream! Check them out now using my link: https://elgato.sjv.io/AshtonMarten
[1:08:41] T33bags: thats because they sell to other countries
[1:08:48] Bellophon: Chinese voice acting was a kinda small industry when Genshin started up I believe.
[1:08:48] Navy_Mongoose: thunderbolt fantasy looks awesome
[1:08:56] Bellophon: Because Arknights did the same thing for a long time.
[1:09:09] Burr11: but then again.. i watched a chinese anime the other day and the chinese VAs were super distracting to me ashton51Tehe
[1:09:12] Returner7: JP VAs are also pretty big in most of east asia
[1:09:47] kyle__senpai: I mean, it's made for a Japanese audience. Of course they would speak Japanese. American adaptations are almost always going to speak English.
[1:09:53] Burr11: it's because the art is so anime looking but then it feels like i'm watching a dub even though its the original voice acting
[1:10:07] chico421: hi ash
[1:10:15] godlessweeb: I didn't know the JP cast were the official genshin ones, I will have go switch to them
[1:10:27] godlessweeb: to*
[1:10:55] Returner7: I gotta check it out again, but I seem to recall some somewhat mediocre Chinese voice acting in parts of Genshin Chinese dub, it is a younger VA market though
[1:10:56] T33bags: they can distrubute to other countries but theyre target is different
[1:10:57] kyle__senpai: Like, Netflix shows simulcast globally...
[1:11:00] T33bags: their*
[1:11:29] kyle__senpai: "same as other stuff" sounds like anime...
[1:11:31] Burr11: it's not very original, but it is very gory which is points if you like that
[1:11:32] rikkaonline: im waiting for the reveal in one more ep then ill probably drop it
[1:12:09] demon_dandy: Yeahhhh i feel that ashton51Tehe
[1:12:15] Burr11: J drama acting is so hammy to me but it's definitely just their sensibilities..
[1:12:19] Returner7: LOL
[1:13:05] Returner7: the way I see it, Japanese media in general is very much more theatrical in nature, as in musical/classical theater
[1:13:10] TheAsterite: It's like they try to take anime acting into live action
[1:13:17] Burr11: lol
[1:13:25] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[1:13:39] Returner7: it's because they get western movies too LOL!!!
[1:13:47] Burr11: yeah 2nd episode is worth watching
[1:13:55] Burr11: and maybe 3rd episode will be interesting

[1:36:30] carpenter_bee__: theyre americanizing
[1:36:32] demon_dandy: I mostly agree but in a sense they might also not be able to get their hands on good shows, its moreso a problem to me when they are very involved with the production

[1:42:01] demon_dandy: I feel that, i think its way more engaging when they get a full squad
[1:42:02] BNMotive: It's too slice of life Trigger needs something more meaty
[1:42:09] vtuberacingcorp: Dunmeshi _does_ become more adventurery
[1:42:09] Kitkattack: @ScarletRook oh thank god, really getting tired of isekai

[1:46:21] demon_dandy: Yeahhhh its bad in jojo

[1:47:02] InsaneLoke: i think, ironically, part 5 had the best sakuga moments in it as well
[1:47:07] Burr11: way of the househusband was very deliberate i assume
[1:47:13] ReyJaggy: big difference with boku yabai that adds new scenes that are not on the manga
[1:47:23] godlessweeb: I hated how fullmetal brotherhood was so similar to the Manga panels, but luckily it was animated at least
[1:47:36] Returner7: don't forget bgm Ashton! ashton51Baby
[1:47:37] TheAsterite: Depends on the anime budget. Gotta keep them profits for the top
[1:47:38] kyle__senpai: JoJo character designs are also too complicated to animate well on a tv budget

[1:50:24] Burr11: i think laios' desire isn't disturbingly detailed
[1:50:30] Burr11: yeah
[1:50:34] demon_dandy: I think because is laios is qlways shown as off his rocker when hes bein slightly weird
[1:50:42] vtuberacingcorp: @Burr11 give it time...
[1:50:50] ScarletRook: "Oh man this author really likes drawing characters tied up"

[1:51:37] demon_dandy: Write that down, write that down
[1:51:47] Burr11: popularity doesnt mean rating yeah
[1:51:50] ReyJaggy: I think she,author,  just really took the world building to another level with the food
[1:51:51] ScarletRook: LOL perfect subject switch
[1:51:58] InsaneLoke: i think, with dunmeshi, the perversion is just fantasy. like, super vague. the author is just obsessed with DND styled fantasy worlds, all aspcts of it
[1:51:59] Burr11: this show is... pretty perverted
[1:52:01] InsaneLoke: oh its this
[1:52:03] AloofCentipede: Pervy shows will do that LOL
[1:52:07] Navy_Mongoose: Espurrs?
[1:52:07] ScarletRook: when we're talking about authors and their interests
[1:52:09] demon_dandy: The manga for this was super ecchi but goregous art, i heard the anime is a let down
[1:52:14] kyle__senpai: Oof dat cg
[1:52:16] Burr11: the CGI is pretty bad
[1:52:29] InsaneLoke: the manga has really pretty yeah
[1:52:35] ReyJaggy: There were a lot of expectations from japanese fans because of manga art
[1:52:38] godlessweeb: No more CGI until more studios can do Beastars quality ashton51Steer
[1:52:54] ReyJaggy: Reward scenes need to step it up
[1:52:54] Burr11: i'm still watching it though because the ecchi moments are pretty chef's kiss
[1:52:58] ReyJaggy: not isekaied
[1:53:01] Navy_Mongoose: then he turns into a dinosaur
[1:53:04] MikeFiro: Hes a Digimon :0

[1:53:21] Navy_Mongoose: hot take, we need more things where the MC turns into a dinosaur

[1:54:31] JulianoUchoa: Hi Ashie

[1:56:28] Burr11: i cant read

[1:57:05] Playmer: It's kind of funny until it happens to my beloved light novels....
[1:57:05] MikeFiro: I heard the anime industry has a really weird production style
[1:57:06] ScarletRook: Light novels are the problems first over manga

[1:57:07] rikkaonline: but the pictures move

[1:57:16] BNMotive: "I WANT MOR ISEKAI HA HA HA purinBaka"
[1:57:19] godlessweeb: I'd rather no adaption than a bad adaption, cause it uses up its one chance
[1:57:19] kyle__senpai: I just don't watch bad adaptations.
[1:57:25] BNMotive: purinBaka
[1:57:28] eeriecabra: blue exorcist has been defiled over and over thru the anime it breaks my HEART
[1:57:29] ReyJaggy: im selective with the anime i watch
[1:57:34] Burr11: i do think there's way too many anime but there's not enough ecchi lately tbh.. this season has been a godsend in that sense haha

[1:58:17] ReyJaggy: I want vagabond to be adapated. so im insane
[1:58:21] TheAsterite: Blobs of color on the screen? But ashton, we love you regardless of internet connection imaHeck imaHeck imaHeck
[1:58:24] InsaneLoke: blue exorcist was the first manga i ever dropped lol
[1:58:27] eeriecabra: ITS MY PERSONALITY TRAIT I LOVE BLUE EXORCIST SO MUCH..
[1:58:32] schwarzundweiss4514: its good so far
[1:58:46] ScarletRook: I really need to catch up in BE! They're finally adapting the arc I like in the anime
[1:58:47] moopyre: im super excited to watch the new blue exorcist
[1:58:50] godlessweeb: Kino's Journey got a masterful adaption in 2003 then a mediocre one years later, strange scenario where fans got to experience both
[1:58:52] ReyJaggy: i never thought dorohedoro would be adapted, but here we are
[1:58:57] eeriecabra: RIGHT
[1:58:58] schwarzundweiss4514: i love it 2
[1:59:13] rikkaonline: yeah :/

[1:59:44] Burr11: urusei yatsura remake isn't bad tho..

[1:59:44] behoimii: !bomb
[1:59:46] rikkaonline: YES
[1:59:50] AshtonMarten: burr11 has won 5 from the jump catch game!
[1:59:55] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:59:56] MikeFiro: Chainsaw Man ashton51Bongo
[1:59:57] ScarletRook: The sailor moon remake ruined the transformations!! I was so mad about the 1st season
[2:00:20] godlessweeb: It's directed by the same guy who did lain, he was so good
[2:00:21] TheAsterite: Was chainsaw man anime good or bad
[2:00:29] InsaneLoke: @TheAsterite depends on who you ask
[2:00:35] ReyJaggy: @Burr11 they change old ecchi scenes D:
[2:00:36] JTBun: I loved it
[2:00:42] demon_dandy: it was good ashton51Baby
[2:00:42] kyle__senpai: It was very influential. A bit of a Sinfeld effect.
[2:00:48] Burr11: i think the upgraded visuals add a lot to it i dunno
[2:00:51] InsaneLoke: it was good but its its own thing
[2:00:54] Burr11: it does suck to lose ecchi though
[2:01:01] Raidou591: tbf the manga reads really fast
[2:01:08] TheAsterite: They wanted it to look like a bad anime? ashton51Heh
[2:01:15] godlessweeb: I've only seen clips of chainsaw man but my first thought was "oh wow an actually well lit anime"
[2:01:15] demon_dandy: I have a lot of criticisms but its got a lot of good parts
[2:01:39] ReyJaggy: But fujimoto was influenced by korean movies to create chainsaw man, so being cinematic makes sense
[2:01:39] InsaneLoke: the anime is beautiful but it loses some subtext and character moments from the manga
[2:01:48] kyle__senpai: Yeah, haven't seen the anime since it is so different. Don't like the look of it.
[2:01:50] justcerebro: me and eds watched the first episode of chainsaw and dropped it on the spot ashton51Smile
[2:02:00] BNMotive: I keep hearing people who I trust turn around and enjoy Jujutsu KAisen. is that something you recommend?
[2:02:05] ReyJaggy: ohhh
[2:02:14] demon_dandy: Chainsaw man loves to be gorgeous when its kind of a messy manga ashton51Tehe
[2:02:21] demon_dandy: Csm anime*
[2:02:29] Burr11: i didnt read CSM manga so can't comment much..
[2:02:30] kyle__senpai: Do you like Naruto? You'll like juju kaisen
[2:02:42] Kitkattack: @demon_dandy I feel pretty much the same way about Dorohedoro
[2:02:44] Playmer: I haven't seen S2 of JJK but I really am disliking where the manga went.
[2:02:52] InsaneLoke: @kyle__senpai this is so funny to me cause im JJK's biggest dickrider but i hate naruto
[2:03:07] godlessweeb: The only.good battle Shonen is yuyu hakusho ashton51Pop
[2:03:16] InsaneLoke: ^weeaboomer
[2:03:18] ScarletRook: different mediums different strengths
[2:03:39] kyle__senpai: @godlessweeb you misspelled Fist of the North Star
[2:03:40] BNMotive: Bocchi the Rock was better because they deviated
[2:03:42] DeviZowL: @godlessweeb the live action right? Kappa
[2:04:04] JTBun: yeah, that's why I love the anime
[2:04:05] godlessweeb: @devizowl was that good, I heard some fans say they liked it but I don't trust netflix
[2:04:15] ReyJaggy: Watch oldboy and you will see some resemblences
[2:04:27] JTBun: I also love the csm manga too, both have their own style and merits
[2:04:29] DeviZowL: idk haven't seen it and haven't seen all of yu yu hakusho either LUL
[2:04:34] Burr11: all i know is i enjoy what they came up with..
[2:04:38] kyle__senpai: Taking heavy fire üöÇüöÉüöÉüöÉüöÉ
[2:04:40] ScarletRook: Its sort of like how for the Kizumonogatari movies they took away the inner monologues which the series is known
[2:04:49] ScarletRook: and made it a different experience
[2:04:53] justcerebro: missed the dungeon meshi part, they shoulda adapted those first 2 episodes different, they're too damn faithful to their detriment
[2:05:02] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten you would probably not like Patlabor 2 the Movie
[2:05:10] justcerebro: but also I don't like trigger's style so even if they do their own thing I won't like it, it's a lose lose for me
[2:05:11] godlessweeb: Manga and anime are different mediums and need to be adapted to fit, fullmetal 2003 being directed like an actual anime versus brotherhood being directed like an animated Manga is a good comparison
[2:05:11] demon_dandy: Yeah she did say that ashton51Tehe
[2:05:29] Playmer: @DeviZowL finish yu yu hakusho...
[2:05:43] TheAsterite: I'm kindof over the trigger style
[2:05:50] kyle__senpai: YES
[2:05:57] Egmanila: YES YES YES
[2:06:15] demon_dandy: I feel that ashton51Kneel
[2:06:17] kyle__senpai: I love it when I see Imaishi keyframes.
[2:06:22] eeriecabra: I LOVE SEEING STORYBOARD DIFFERENCES...
[2:06:22] vtuberacingcorp: how can you be over the trigger style, their stuff is killer. They don't even put out that much content...
[2:06:22] Burr11: i love trigger style because it has some of that western flavor while still being anime..
[2:06:59] kyle__senpai: They've made some crap tbh. Kind of over Imaishi as a director
[2:07:05] Egmanila: ashton51Omegalul
[2:07:07] ScarletRook: yeah story isnt their strong suit
[2:07:07] vtuberacingcorp: Yeah but the style?

[2:17:32] T33bags: you also like him because he has dark hair
[2:17:39] godlessweeb: "Being a bitch to her in sign language" that is such a funny concept tbh
[2:17:39] ROSWEIN: which show we talking about again?
[2:17:40] Burr11: i think its the way he kinda cuts her down, the way he's so concerned
[2:17:57] godlessweeb: Signing out "fuck yourself" letter by letter
[2:17:58] Xuang101: Hello Ashton ashton51Squish
[2:17:59] rikkaonline: if theyre expecting her to read lips instead of just signing, theyre kind of being shitty
[2:18:07] kyle__senpai: Ok, good point. I'm mostly teasing.

[2:20:41] Burr11: it's okay.. some people are a bit too gobsmacked by it
[2:20:41] kyle__senpai: No one is mystified like that. It's basically emotional porn for women.
[2:20:46] Ed_The_Engineer: Hello right now I'm watching SmackDown and in the crowd waldo was there from where is waldo
[2:20:47] eeriecabra: ig considering the premise u would expect more nuance than something overly sweet

[2:21:05] Burr11: true
[2:21:17] MikeFiro: i dont :(

[2:22:07] demon_dandy: Oh yeaaaah LMAO
[2:22:09] mushi_buns: it is an anime ashton51Stare
[2:22:17] godlessweeb: Did he make him more of a fuckboy in the anime compared to the manga
[2:22:21] godlessweeb: They*
[2:22:38] MikeFiro: we dont read here >:[
[2:22:38] Burr11: he like takes advantage of the fact she's deaf so he has an excuse to get her attention by touching and stuff lol
[2:22:48] justcerebro: you're such a manga hater...

[2:23:55] mushi_buns: interesting!!
[2:24:14] Navy_Mongoose: I don't know japanese so I've watched way more youtube video essays than watched anime in a very long time
[2:24:21] Burr11: anime feels less effort to me too
[2:24:25] T33bags: i mean i know japanese too but watching anime is a commitment of time that is not comparable to manga
[2:24:39] kyle__senpai: It is weird if the original author isn't deaf tho
[2:24:46] demon_dandy: I can read more manga than watch anime tbh
[2:25:37] TheAsterite: Did you watch the tatami galaxy?
[2:25:39] rikkaonline: i feel like that kind of overprotective friend could be a common experience for deaf people
[2:25:45] demon_dandy: Its only ep 3 so ig we'll see ashton51Tehe
[2:26:07] Kitkattack: dating person with disability should probably be handled differently than some vanilla ass shoujo, I hear ya

[2:27:02] horribleham: LOL
[2:27:02] TheAsterite: jetsPoint
[2:27:04] rikkaonline: a cahracter thats not the villain is being imperfect? that means the show is bad
[2:27:10] demon_dandy: People gettin mad at the character meant to be an ass
[2:27:24] Burr11: @demon_dandy that happens SO OFTEN lmao
[2:27:31] BNMotive: is eating home made curry* purinJii hom hom*
[2:27:45] godlessweeb: The moral of the story is delete twitter ashton51Tensai
[2:27:57] TheAsterite: What kind of sign language does japan use?
[2:28:04] rikkaonline: idk if knowing multiple speaking languages would lend to learning jsl fast, but i ahd an ex that knew asl and she picked up jsl pretty fast
[2:28:10] Burr11: honestly didnt know
[2:28:31] demon_dandy: its scarier when ashton speaks fast and points her finger at me when ranting with no bgm ashton51Wibble
[2:28:36] rikkaonline: it sounded like they were very different
[2:28:50] kyle__senpai: Unrelated, it would be cool if they all used the same sign language so then you can call talk with other deaf people
[2:28:59] MikeFiro: ye :(
[2:29:12] MikeFiro: i thought ashy was angy ashton51Wibble ashton51Wibble
[2:29:14] InsaneLoke: khhhhh i wish we could watch the dandadan trailer but that anime isnt till fall...

[2:29:37] AshtonMarten: kyle__senpai has won 5 from the jump catch game!
[2:29:39] demon_dandy: I think you said this but its be interesting if they didnt give her an internal voice
[2:29:48] rikkaonline: a lot of them appeared in isolated communities on thier own
[2:29:58] Playmer: there‚Äôs also like British Sign Language and Australian Sign Language.
[2:30:02] demon_dandy: At least for a few scenes
[2:30:31] InsaneLoke: i was shocked too, when i saw the clip circulating i was expecting that
[2:30:37] Burr11: for A Silent Voice they had an actual deaf person do her voice in the english dub
[2:30:59] demon_dandy: A silent voice clears ashton51Tensai
[2:31:08] rikkaonline: i wonder if jp deaf people wouldnt speak as much because it might be seen as disturbing there
[2:31:22] rikkaonline: i mean like standing out
[2:31:29] InsaneLoke: i get that
[2:31:37] kyle__senpai: @rikkaonline they don't speak as much because Japanese people don't speak in public unnecessarily
[2:31:41] Kitkattack: Ash a lot of Japanese culture is about not standing out or making a scene
[2:31:49] InsaneLoke: the weird status quo shit in JP culture
[2:32:19] demon_dandy: Its pretty cute from what i seen ashton51Baby
[2:32:31] Kitkattack: "the taller nail gets the hammer" and tons more idioms have a lot of weight
[2:32:31] BNMotive: purinThonk lets move on
[2:32:40] MechaBatvidyas: At work. Quick pit stop. Hey chillas. ashton51Wah
[2:32:45] godlessweeb: "Oh boy I hope she talks about my favorite anime Mashle"
[2:32:47] Burr11: i feel like even JP people would be a little more compassionate in the case of a deaf person ashton51Tehe
[2:32:50] demon_dandy: It might also be an internal thing, ive known deaf people who are too embarrassed
[2:32:54] InsaneLoke: do you read the manga for bokuyaba
[2:32:59] StreamElements: Check out my website which has links to all my socials! https://vtuber.racing/

[2:34:01] demon_dandy: I dropped it cause the emo boy at the start but its kind of a swerve LMAO
[2:34:04] vtuberacingcorp: You just have to watch the first 2-3 episodes to understand what it's about.
[2:34:06] ReyJaggy: she has so many insecurities
[2:34:12] mushi_buns: I read the summary and it look kinda weird ashton51Tehe
[2:34:12] ReyJaggy: ashton51Neso
[2:34:25] MikeFiro: ü§î
[2:34:34] Burr11: to me the biggest swerve was how ecchi the early episodes were given how glowing people are about it being "wholesome"
[2:34:51] demon_dandy: ashton51Stare
[2:34:52] InsaneLoke: its not even a dropped plot with the emo stuff, they are in middle school so he just gets over the 8th grade syndrome stuff

[2:45:46] InsaneLoke: the manga was ass but sometimes good
[2:45:47] rikkaonline: the gyaru in this one is like the fuck boy in yubisaki, but the mc being an incompetent self insert that loses his shit at any attention ruins it imo
