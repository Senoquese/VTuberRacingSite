[0:59:28] PSYCOMMUnist: Different ANC headphones have different levels of white noise.
[0:59:29] y2kkmac: ears are quite sensitive
[0:59:30] redactedenheim: yeah its like sound pressure
[0:59:30] InsaneLoke: yeah
[0:59:34] PSYCOMMUnist: It depends on the model.
[0:59:35] Ortintzki: YES ACTUAKLLY
[0:59:39] y2kkmac: yes 100% know what you mean
[0:59:40] InsaneLoke: i can hear the hum from the noise cancelling
[0:59:40] cobatts: I've never actually wanted to use ANC
[0:59:45] InsaneLoke: its like a fan
[0:59:47] mareeples: Yeah, its kind-of like a seashell noise.
[0:59:52] Ortintzki: I would get headaches ferom the noise cancelling because it was jut constant "noise" in my hear.
[0:59:53] InsaneLoke: like a whooshing
[1:00:04] TheComputerClan: Oh hi! It's Ashton! I just met you at the Sonic Speed Cafe : D
[1:00:15] pogotross: the pressure feeling goes away after a little bit
[1:00:22] TheHarf: I understand what you mean
[1:00:30] TheComputerClan: Oh nice : D
[1:00:36] y2kkmac: you can get used to that feeling, sometimes your brain thinks your ears popped because it's not used to that little noise
[1:00:37] TheComputerClan: Aw well thank you. : )
[1:00:55] pogotross: she did, though, she's calling you a NERD

[1:02:40] Burr11: yeah oled monitors are a different breed
[1:02:42] PSYCOMMUnist: I don't think OLED is as smart for monitors, static images can cause burn in
[1:02:46] PSYCOMMUnist: It's different for a TV
[1:02:47] Burr11: ^
[1:02:47] demon_dandy: New screen kinda awesomeee ashton51Thinky not like normal screen

[1:03:33] yojamjam: boutta have a digimon special edition monitor
[1:03:40] TheHarf: I use eye saver blue light filters though lol
[1:03:53] redactedenheim: AI doesn't need oleds so you're good

[1:06:49] demon_dandy: It could be awesome for all i know ashton51Tehe
[1:06:49] yojamjam: it's like a 3ds i think
[1:06:51] rikkaonline: 3d glasses usually
[1:07:12] PSYCOMMUnist: That tech is called parallax barrier
[1:07:13] pogotross: nah 3d has flopped every time they've tried it, it's a bad idea
[1:07:19] rikkaonline: 3d tech gets given another shot every ~20 years and its just not worth the cost or quality drop
[1:07:34] demon_dandy: I just remember hearing about it just around or before smart tvs so they were the expensive option
[1:07:46] DavidPortnov: That does sound cool.
[1:07:55] DavidPortnov: Haven't seen that.
[1:08:13] Burr11: yeah dont know what you're talking about
[1:08:20] Burr11: is it like the laptop effect they did with marine?
[1:08:38] DavidPortnov: I can imagine what it might look like.
[1:09:01] Burr11: it's like a video of a laptop with another screen on top to give the 3D effect at 90 degree angle like you said
[1:09:07] Burr11: i dont remember seeing one with korone
[1:09:24] Romblymo: That tech sorta needed you to wear a thing and only worked for like 1 person
[1:09:51] DavidPortnov: Oh! I saw it was a thing, but not what it was.
[1:10:07] JTBun: LMAO
