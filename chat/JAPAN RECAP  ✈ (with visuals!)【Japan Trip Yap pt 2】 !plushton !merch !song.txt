[1:40:12] rikkaonline: foreigners when you say what state youre from: "we dont know your states, just say america" foreigners when you say america: "obviously, what state?"
[1:40:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Tell them you are a chilla born on the cold streets using the bean for cover.
[1:40:28] Robert_Brown_: US states are pretty big after all

[1:44:32] Based_Hopper: Ashton doesn't believe in borrow words
[1:44:36] orminthebox: "Darake" („Å†„Çâ„Åë) in "Mandarake" means "covered" in Korean. In other words, the meaning of Mandarake's company name is "full of manga".
[1:44:38] Burr11: its definitely not mandrake
[1:44:38] rikkaonline: they spell it „Åæ„Çì„Å†„Çâ„Åë, im gonna pronounce it „Åæ„Çì„Å†„Çâ„Åë

[1:45:22] thomas2uentin: not all katakana words are borrowed words
[1:45:26] Kitkattack: I thought it was just niche fantasy reference...
[1:45:27] orminthebox: according to https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EB%A7%8C%EB%8B%A4%EB%9D%BC%EC%BC%80
