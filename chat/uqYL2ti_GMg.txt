[0:49:01] redactedenheim: the doorman is merely the gateway to the BuildingEntryAttendantVerse
[0:49:08] InsaneLoke: i dont think hes a kid of a god. i dont think they can be born traditionally
[0:49:13] fatcacha: he would be too powerful if he was just a god
[0:49:45] WumblyGrumbly: hello i'm here for my masters thesis
[0:49:48] Senoquese: what gets me is why doorman would wanna overtake the patrons and fight one of them , possibly his mom, if hes already the kid of one
[0:50:07] Senoquese: LOL
[0:50:15] terralimite: please keep yapping
[0:50:25] timinator193: @terralimite this

[0:58:53] PSYCOMMUnist: That's valid.
[0:58:57] to_aru_Oni: Basically Tetsuya Nomura's style? I've gotten really tired of it yeah
[0:59:00] lnnards: Lies of P was extremely mid imo
[0:59:12] butwhenwilltheylearn: they just gotta lean into it like e33
[0:59:21] PSYCOMMUnist: Lies of P isn't trying to be misery Hell shit world to the extent Dark Souls is.
[0:59:33] 0oGooseo0: oki, time to play more nightreign. everdark boss time
[0:59:42] spikebomb5: it feels similar to french weeb stuff
[1:00:01] redactedenheim: souls games cost me so much in thrown controller repairs that I opted out
[1:00:04] timinator193: I think so, not really worth unless you got ppl to play tho
[1:00:08] pantalaimon91: I've heard the DLC for lies of p makes that better and re-contextualizes a lot of stuff
[1:00:09] 0oGooseo0: i wish they had more updates, but the dlc is good imo
[1:00:11] timinator193: nightreign
[1:00:22] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul

[1:00:51] PSYCOMMUnist: I dunno' deranged alchemists and automaton massacre and the ethics of telling a lie are a pretty good story to me.
[1:01:09] demon_dandy: I do like pinnochio stories but it was a lil on the nose
[1:01:21] spikebomb5: story is watever, theming aint bad, feel is more of the same
[1:01:29] demon_dandy: I didnt even mean that ICANT
[1:01:38] PSYCOMMUnist: I mean it's a retelling of Pinochio. It's very direct.
[1:01:46] PSYCOMMUnist: It's not really meant to be an allusion.
[1:02:01] Senoquese: so you hate waffles
[1:02:06] donothang: sowwy ashton gotta go
[1:02:09] donothang: wub u by by

[1:02:34] EmkaZRC: ashton51Omegalul
[1:02:38] redactedenheim: same rage, different day
[1:02:38] PSYCOMMUnist: I like it more than Dark Souls and I played DS1 within the first month it came out.
[1:02:46] 0oGooseo0: im hoping that duskbloods can meet the expectations that bloodborne set
[1:03:12] PSYCOMMUnist: It'd be more Ouiaboo for Lies of P if anything.
[1:03:21] KazooManEvan: KazooManEvan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hi Ashton! Starting year 2 with the pit crew and I love it here! Thanks for being our amazing race queen! I also must shill Lies of P while we're talking souls games
[1:03:27] ticklemeastolfo: as a switch 2 exclusive idk man

[1:03:34] TheAsterite: Im surprised code vein made enough sales for a sequel
[1:03:38] Superfroakie82: i like the robot puppets idea but idk how much focus it gives that
[1:03:38] ArthurWar: We don't have a date yet iirc
[1:03:45] timinator193: @ticklemeastolfo Yeah, they're just trying to push it
[1:03:49] yojamjam: switch 2 is a cursed console it will never have a game
[1:03:50] demon_dandy: monhun is fuuuuun
[1:03:51] ArthurWar: Actually, have we seen anything about it since its announcement
[1:03:59] spikebomb5: at least it's not ass like the surge or lords of the fallen
[1:04:05] lnnards: i trust From Software, but Switch exclusive multiplayer title is a bizarre move
[1:04:11] KazooManEvan: @yojamjam PS5 mentioned no games alliance
[1:04:15] EmkaZRC: Duskbloods is a pvpve like Nightrein so no way it can measure up to Bloodborne imo
[1:04:20] Senoquese: ashton51Nodders
[1:04:21] timinator193: @lnnards YES
[1:04:22] PSYCOMMUnist: Monster Hunter has parrying, guarding, ziplines in Rise there are weapons that don't even have a roll.
[1:04:28] ArthurWar: Yep, Switch 2 exclusive, it was announced in their reveal direct
[1:04:33] EmkaZRC: They announced it as a Switch 2
[1:04:38] TheAsterite: Microsoft doesnt even sell the series x anymore (in costco)
[1:04:39] spikebomb5: we gotta play first berzerker khazan
[1:04:39] EmkaZRC: Exclusive
[1:04:39] yojamjam: bananza is what people say when you say this but are they playing it? no
[1:04:40] timinator193: No, we're lying ashton
[1:05:16] spikebomb5: its 8 player???
[1:05:20] Senoquese: about switch 2 having games
[1:05:20] TheAsterite: A lot of people played bananza on release. You might be too live service brained
[1:05:22] EmkaZRC: My cope theory is that it's a timed exclusive
[1:05:25] Superfroakie82: bananza was really good though
[1:05:27] TheAsterite: ashton51Tehe
[1:05:28] KazooManEvan: @spikebomb5 Im back reading I know but it was an incredible boss fight and amazingly cinematic
[1:05:54] spikebomb5: fromsoft battle royale
[1:05:59] Senoquese: ashton51Omegalul
[1:06:00] TheAsterite: There's also kirby air riders ashton51Shy
[1:06:03] ArthurWar: LOL
[1:06:03] timinator193: ?
[1:06:04] demon_dandy: Fuuuuuuuuuuuck its gonna be an extraction soulslike
[1:06:04] F1nalStarman: I've never heard anyone mention Donkey Kong Bananza except Dunkey. People only talk about MK World.
[1:06:07] nomzoogles: she didnt know...
[1:06:15] Senoquese: LMFAO
[1:06:18] timinator193: @demon_dandy ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:06:20] yojamjam: it's got blood
[1:06:22] PSYCOMMUnist: I really hope the slop usage era ends by 2026.
[1:06:22] HmmHrmHarumph: blood in title
[1:06:23] EmkaZRC: See? That's why I think there's no way it'll be as good as Bloodborne
[1:06:24] ticklemeastolfo: ashton51Smile she didn't know
[1:06:29] PSYCOMMUnist: It's such an annoying meme.
[1:06:37] lnnards: From getting their Nintendo money
[1:06:41] redactedenheim: this is true Sols, rage quit before you even buy the game
[1:06:48] ArthurWar: We don't know much about it and have not seen anything about it beyond its trailer, so I guess we'll see
[1:06:55] spikebomb5: reading the description, its a dedicated souls pvp game LUL
[1:07:01] yojamjam: duskbloods is bankrolling bloodborne ports ashton51Cope ashton51Cope ashton51Cope ashton51Cope
[1:07:05] MoreSpidersThanIExpected: 2026 is the year of slop slop
[1:07:08] HmmHrmHarumph: slopping our way to the next decade ashton51Salute
[1:07:08] rikkaonline: tired of all the slopslop tbh
[1:07:11] nomzoogles: qualityslop is a genuine all timer
[1:07:12] pogotross: slop is peak ashtonslop
[1:07:17] Yuukozu: eight nine
[1:07:24] F1nalStarman: @PSYCOMMUnist +2 the term slop is disrespectful to actual art imo
[1:07:36] TheAsterite: So many extractionslop
[1:07:44] PSYCOMMUnist: @F1nalStarman It kills meaningful discussion which drives me insane as a person who went to school for literary crit.
[1:08:01] Superfroakie82: yeah i just dont like what slop does to any discussion
[1:08:04] Senoquese: eyupppp
[1:08:06] spikebomb5: description says it's not extraction slop. everyone gets roles either to protect or kill a specific player, matches end when 1 person is left
[1:08:07] Calmo_Ho: HELLO ASHTON MARTEN!!!
[1:08:09] PSYCOMMUnist: Anything that kills nuance drives me crazy.
[1:08:14] timinator193: @PSYCOMMUnist Reminds me of the "who asked" bit
[1:08:18] yojamjam: slop was necessary to fight the tide of people calling every shonen peak
[1:08:27] TheAsterite: Extractionroyaleslop
[1:08:33] Senoquese: expecting cosmetic microtransactions given pvp means you can see other players all the time
[1:08:37] rikkaonline: qualityslop is jumping the shark imo
[1:08:46] pogotross: @yojamjam that was "mid", slop was anti-ai until it wasn't
[1:09:01] timinator193: Nightreign...
[1:09:01] InsaneLoke: armor
[1:09:10] PSYCOMMUnist: @rikkaonline yeah it becomes a completely meaningless term at that point
[1:09:13] redactedenheim: see Fonzie
[1:09:14] timinator193: literally nightreighn has skins
[1:09:16] admiral_frogger: going a step too far
[1:09:17] rikkaonline: its the point where the thing has gone too far
[1:09:17] InsaneLoke: its when you jump over a shark
[1:09:23] pogotross: it's from when Fonzie jumped over a shark
[1:09:24] TheAsterite: Jumping the shark is an old reference
[1:09:24] Senoquese: jumping the shark is like when you run out of normal ideas so you go absurd
[1:09:28] niertlwal: it's an uncterm
[1:09:30] butwhenwilltheylearn: people
[1:09:30] nomzoogles: lol
[1:09:31] spikebomb5: its when something gets so far away from it's original concept
[1:09:36] HmmHrmHarumph: when you get really cool and are able to jump over sharks
[1:09:37] yojamjam: only ashton uses qualityslop unironically, it was conceived as a joke
[1:09:38] Superfroakie82: it means it did something so ridiculous that it can’t be topped, only downhill
[1:09:43] demon_dandy: Its just this eras of cringe based posting
[1:09:49] admiral_frogger: @niertlwal I feel attacked. It's an old reference but it should still check out.
[1:09:51] redactedenheim: The Fonz jumped over a shark
[1:09:57] butwhenwilltheylearn: people pay for gacha and most are single player
[1:10:02] Senoquese: YES
[1:10:03] TheAsterite: It came from the fonzie literally jumping over a shark
[1:10:05] nomzoogles: YEA LOL
[1:10:05] timinator193: ctrl+shift+T
[1:10:08] demon_dandy: ICANT

[1:10:13] HmmHrmHarumph: EVERYBODY TAKE COVER
[1:10:15] niertlwal: 911 daytime tv
[1:10:24] Senoquese: that hospital has been bombed like 5 times
[1:10:25] PSYCOMMUnist: The post-irony era is so miserable if you're a sincere and authentic person.
[1:10:37] Senoquese: big stretch
[1:10:37] niertlwal: the gray's anatomy bomb episode is jumping the shark
[1:10:44] niertlwal: but also the best episode
[1:10:52] BFlatTV: ashton you cant be funny and also a baddie you gotta pick a side
[1:11:08] aathray: one of those ones that went in one ear and out the other
[1:11:13] insp_gadget: The house exploding on little house on the prairie still makes me laugh.
[1:11:25] fatcacha: please stop woth the body thong..
[1:11:28] TheAsterite: I mean, it was kindof literal when it happened ashton51Hehe
[1:11:31] Senoquese: i think its fair to not understand what it means given its a reference to an actual tv episode
[1:11:31] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:11:36] Superfroakie82: its not true they tell lies
[1:11:38] pogotross: oh no she has hot girl personality peepoSad
[1:11:38] F1nalStarman: Nah, it's a media criticism thing. If you aren't oldge or someone who hangs around TVTropes, you wouldn't know about jumping the shark
[1:11:38] redactedenheim: its not technically a crime
[1:11:41] eeveesashimi: you can do both and more as a treat
[1:11:44] moose_lee_san: cosplay wasn't enough now she wants handcuffs
[1:12:07] Senoquese: ashton51Omegalul

[1:12:24] deafmutelaughing: you should have been like me and spent hours as a teenager browsing tvtropes
[1:12:34] kasa1671: I asked a lot of questions, probably why I’m a cs major now lol
[1:12:47] BFlatTV: oh im sorry bestie
[1:12:47] butwhenwilltheylearn: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
[1:12:56] rikkaonline: telling you to pick a side is implying youre both lol
[1:13:13] timinator193: That's the joke dummy
[1:13:20] BFlatTV: what do that mean
[1:13:28] pogotross: it means your chickens hatched
[1:13:28] spikebomb5: id rather fromsoft experiment with genres and be good games than be like platinumgames and wanting to pivot to live service/mobile games
[1:13:29] aathray: it means the thing you have is more valuable than potential
[1:13:29] Calmo_Ho: please dont cry ashton marten
[1:13:34] deafmutelaughing: I only recently discovered what "a stitch in time saves nine" means. the lack of commas confused me
[1:13:34] Superfroakie82: i think vtubers as a concept prove you can have both tbh
[1:13:36] admiral_frogger: A sword in the hand is worth two pens in the bush
[1:13:49] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: @butwhenwilltheylearn This one means "It's better to have something tangible vs the idea of multiple things you might not get"
[1:14:09] Senoquese: ashton51Wibble
