[7:13:21] demon_dandy: His voice too Flirt
[7:13:43] demon_dandy: Yeah the og one looks so funny LOL
[7:13:49] Noworksm: Wait who was that on the right?
[7:13:51] CrazyRubberDuck: He still wears his matrix fit at work, what a nerd
[7:14:00] InsaneLoke: i dont think hes nanami coded.... i will stand by him  being a through and through Char clone
[7:14:11] demon_dandy: Erro ashton Flirt kyaaa
[7:14:20] InsaneLoke: he has a sense of gentleness about him that nanami lacks
[7:14:49] demon_dandy: I think he means wesker
[7:14:58] InsaneLoke: erm im non binary but thats besides the point
[7:15:03] FranzNF: Male tangBarf
[7:15:04] ScholarofGames: All I hear is cope
[7:15:20] demon_dandy: Wesker and nanami actually youre cooking
[7:15:34] demon_dandy: ICANT
[7:15:42] Navy_Mongoose: it happens, maybe they played as Chris?
[7:15:49] demon_dandy: Mix some shit up hell yeah
[7:15:50] InsaneLoke: nanami doesnt take shit and is constantly done with everything. he is empathetic but lacks the patience to put up with stuff that pisses him off

[7:17:40] InsaneLoke: im locked to the prison bars by a shonen action series
[7:17:46] Noworksm: The name Nanami goes in one ear and out the other for me
[7:17:56] InsaneLoke: wesker has patience at the very least
[7:17:57] ScholarofGames: At this point? Not much.
[7:18:00] ScholarofGames: He does later.
[7:18:03] Navy_Mongoose: he's a suave hotshot I guess
[7:18:05] demon_dandy: He gets some later on
[7:18:13] ScholarofGames: Yeah
[7:18:14] InsaneLoke: hes planning and keeps to himself
[7:18:14] CrazyRubberDuck: He wears sunglasses in doors and at night, does that count?
[7:18:40] InsaneLoke: his characterization is literally just char
[7:18:54] InsaneLoke: everything you know about char can be applied to him pretty much
[7:18:59] InsaneLoke: including the yaoi
[7:19:01] Noworksm: Later on he is
[7:19:21] demon_dandy: LOL
[7:19:27] InsaneLoke: i need that goldfish so bad
[7:19:30] demon_dandy: Drop the bag ü§öüòø
[7:19:30] Noworksm: Genuinely curious, where's both the Gundam and RE yaoi?
[7:19:45] InsaneLoke: hold noworks, im going to go searching
[7:19:50] CrazyRubberDuck: You already used that one
[7:19:52] Noworksm: bless
[7:20:07] demon_dandy: That shit been goin for generations
[7:20:16] Noworksm: The vast Gundam yaoi I've found is Turn A
[7:20:17] ScholarofGames: 1 terminal per code
[7:20:52] InsaneLoke: turn a is like the straightest gundam thats so funny
[7:21:52] Navy_Mongoose: I think the gimmick here got carried over
[7:22:32] Navy_Mongoose: Login: WESKER Pass: WESKERRRRR
[7:22:46] demon_dandy: Cereal
[7:22:57] Navy_Mongoose: Data?
[7:23:00] StreamElements: Stream my first original song „Äé RACING LINE „Äè now! https://ffm.to/racingline (It's eurobeat!)
[7:24:31] Noworksm: @InsaneLoke to be fair, Loran is fairly effeminate relative to other gundam protags
[7:24:32] InsaneLoke: okay 7
[7:24:59] InsaneLoke: ohh thats what you mean. yeah, turn a has a lot of cross dressing loran art but i think it lacks the yaoi
[7:26:18] InsaneLoke: god this game looks so good
[7:26:30] InsaneLoke: id love to see it in a modern resolution
[7:27:11] 0NIB0: good progress Clap
[7:27:28] demon_dandy: There have been rumors of an re1 re remake but itd probably be without fixed camera
[7:27:35] Noworksm: @InsaneLoke I haven't gotten to Turn A yet so my knowledge on how yaoi it is relates to how many doujins are out there. I've watched all of UC, but as far as AU goes I'm only up to Gundam X rn.
