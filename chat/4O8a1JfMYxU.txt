[0:31:15] stormy_halo: I really liked twilight princess at the time, but going back i acknowledge it was kinda a period piece
[0:31:19] rikkaonline: oot was great but i think some people got too stuck on it defining the zelda aesthetic
[0:31:26] american_cookie_1: Is that a rodent?
[0:31:27] Pyco__: Wasn’t the art style a response to the anger over wind waker’s art?
[0:31:29] TheRATifier1: I loved LTTP the most. Mainly because of nostalgia.
[0:31:42] thedidlydoo: I finished the Twilight Princess Manga series too! I now own all 11 volumes of it!
[0:31:46] thedidlydoo: @Pyco__ YEs
[0:31:50] barfchan: people were so mad about WW being cartoony
[0:31:51] thedidlydoo: It was.
[0:31:55] plazynoodles: @rikkaonline i think limiting zeldas aesthetic sucks i love the diversity
[0:31:55] demon_dandy: Thats what i always heard, people ragged on WW
[0:31:59] mushi_buns: Wind Waker so cuteee

[0:32:01] Pyco__: WW is beautiful
[0:32:14] Niles_SadKFPEmployee: When it came out it got hate
[0:32:23] demon_dandy: Nahhhh people hated on wind waker for so long that even i remember it pre wii
[0:32:30] Senoquese: yeah wind waker was kinda hated when it first came out, since it was announced as a realistic game before it changed artstyle
[0:32:34] thedidlydoo: It's because of the Spaceworld 2000 demo of Link and Ganondorf that got fans excited for a grittier Zelda game.
[0:32:34] plazynoodles: twilight princess link might be the hottest link suprLEWD
[0:32:51] Niles_SadKFPEmployee: @plazynoodles he IS the hottest Link

[0:33:06] thedidlydoo: Skyward Sword Link is the goofy dork.
[0:33:07] demon_dandy: People were always like "make link look like melee link ashton51Squish "

[2:25:29] mrp0p1nfr3sh: THAT EXPERIMENTAL N64
[2:25:34] GravityAndBiscuits: Guess it's like a sponsorship.
[2:25:41] Senoquese: oh i intentionally made the chinchilla shitty looking since there was NO WAY i could add a serious model while those animations are stupid af LOL
[2:26:36] zwoomf: they are so goofy its perfect

[2:39:58] zwoomf: there is that annoying one in the box
[2:40:39] Senoquese: its so funny seeing you do stuff on my game and then only see it like 6 seconds after on stream

[2:42:26] GravityAndBiscuits: So, if a crewmember opens a chest with an important item in it, do you get it too?
[2:42:36] ReyJaggy: Yes
[2:42:36] BigsBiggson: i saw that you had your own model and its also adorable btw so had to raid!
[2:43:20] demon_dandy: So true ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[2:43:21] GravityAndBiscuits: 'Even on foot'. Do you do footraces also?
[2:44:09] GravityAndBiscuits: The goron said that it shouldn't take long to get to their village, even on foot.
[2:45:01] rikkaonline: maybe they should eat the rocks blocking parts of their town >:(
[2:45:19] Pyco__: Why don’t they eat the boulder in the way?
[2:45:19] KyuuMJ: Minerals are healthy.  But do they need Vitamins too?
[2:45:20] GravityAndBiscuits: Maybe he has Acromegaly. Like Andre the giant.
[2:45:34] derkley321: Being so picky when there is a food shortage smh
[2:45:37] ReyJaggy: Do goron eat chillas too? We are pretty nutritious
[2:46:02] KyuuMJ: Not enough minerals
[2:46:16] GravityAndBiscuits: You have not enough minerals.
[2:46:18] ReyJaggy: They milk rock, just like almond milk
[2:46:35] Pyco__: Like those birds that eat small rocks to break up good since they can’t chew?
[2:47:11] Senoquese: ooh the ocarina songs are synced
[2:47:24] GravityAndBiscuits: Anyway, they seem to eat minerals and rocks. Makes me glad I'm mostly plastic and silicon.
[2:47:26] ReyJaggy: Do you think tears of kingdom will add ocarinas or something else?
[2:47:58] metaconstruct: r-rock shortage huh
[2:48:08] KyuuMJ: I am surprised how the Goron race survive
[2:48:21] GravityAndBiscuits: I mean, it's not like you can grow rocks, so any shortage is just going to grow worse.
[2:48:57] derkley321: The shortage is because what they think is the best rocks are cut off
[2:49:19] KyuuMJ: Yea, they should start eating dirt
[2:49:30] derkley321: Was replying to gravityandbiscuits
[2:49:52] BNMotive: you can reset the stick so you dont waste by putting it away
[2:49:56] Pyco__: Do you think sand is like salt or pepper to Gorons?
[2:50:21] KyuuMJ: More like cinnamon

[2:53:49] KyuuMJ: Hmm, Gorons eat rocks.  Then what is lava to them?
[2:53:52] KyuuMJ: Smoothies?
[2:54:10] Senoquese: the ashton 64 rom is compatible with randomizers and twitch integration afaik so you could do that, but then id actually be responsible if theres bugs or crashes LOL
[2:55:11] ReyJaggy: how are we from adultshton?
[2:55:16] ReyJaggy: far
