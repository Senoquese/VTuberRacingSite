[2:37:33] phatscout: they did a ton of theme park stuff in the 90s and most of it kinda bombed hard
[2:37:48] mushi_buns: closes is joyopolis but its basically a sega store not worth it
[2:37:54] Returner7: joyopolis is sorta more like an arcade
[2:37:54] phatscout: but joyopolis or however it's spelled is still very much a thing
