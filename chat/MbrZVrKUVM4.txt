[2:04:52] Returner7: I believe that is what Carl Jung referred to as the collective unconscious
[2:04:58] KyuuAA: Hard wired into our instincts
[2:05:31] american_cookie_1: I wish I would‚Äôve cherished and appreciated my childhood innocence that was ripped away from such a young age. But it‚Äôs far too late.
[2:05:37] KyuuAA: I feel that way with mahjong
[2:06:09] yojamjam: and now we say things like I WAS HERE PogChamp

[2:09:00] TheRATifier1: We hope you remain immortalized too ash.
[2:09:12] KyuuAA: The offspring thing is a bit different
[2:09:15] american_cookie_1: Life is the an experience. Life is a temporary endeavor. You have about 100 years or less to live it. You get no do overs, no sequel, and no re-reads.
[2:09:27] KyuuAA: We want them live past our lives
[2:09:27] Returner7: eh I'd say culture is a huge factor, certainly vitally important in Eastern Cultures

[2:10:01] horribleham: ough. When the mortality thoughts get me at night chromu1Woicrush chromu1Woicrush
[2:10:07] american_cookie_1: Immorality is not literally living forever. The only obtainable immortality is the impression we leave on the people around us.
[2:10:17] BudderZilla: ashy-washy
[2:10:19] cakeswindle: no mental breakdowns today ahston :[
[2:10:27] KyuuAA: I am ok with cremation

[2:13:31] american_cookie_1: Just put a bullet through my skull so my brain stops processing information. I don‚Äôt want to be aware
[2:13:43] Senoquese: i wonder if "dead" people literally do think about their whole lives, in the same way dreams only last a few minutes
[2:13:57] american_cookie_1: Immorality doesn‚Äôt seem fun for me.
[2:14:21] KyuuAA: On a positive note, we make it a point to enjoy our time as much as possible

[2:16:54] demon_dandy: i dont like whining you but chromu1Woicrush
[2:17:16] brettmatthew: do you subscribe to the thought that the afterlife is the same as before you were born?
[2:17:20] JTBun: is death the hot wolf from puss n boots?
[2:17:28] KyuuAA: Once it is it .. that's it
[2:17:47] demon_dandy: god gives their cutest soldiers his strongest battles chromu1Woicrush

[2:18:33] Dwinkus: dude watch out the planet
[2:18:36] TheRATifier1: Anyway what about you not being religious?

[2:20:07] horribleham: ashton51Tensai I actually know everything.
[2:20:34] american_cookie_1: It‚Äôs a pleasant thought, but very unlikely.
[2:20:37] brettmatthew: i think theres a lot we knew at one point in time thats been lost in a global reset of sorts
[2:20:37] demon_dandy: i do think the endless discerning of afterlife is a bit frustrating
[2:20:46] KyuuAA: Oh, I kinda do
[2:21:07] KyuuAA: Considering how people lived and died before we existed
[2:21:13] TheRATifier1: Well if you want my opinion. Maybe that was God giving you that feeling of relief(?) as a way of telling you to not worry? I mean this world is unpredictable.
[2:21:23] kawaiicrew4ever: reading umineko teaches you all the secrets to the universe ashton51Tensai

[2:30:11] KyuuAA: I feel sorry for anyone with an opposite ratio
[2:30:11] TheRATifier1: If they don‚Äôt like you for you or your yes‚Äôs and no‚Äôs they‚Äôre not real pals.
