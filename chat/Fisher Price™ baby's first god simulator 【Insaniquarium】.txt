[3:54:48] demon_dandy: conker gets shitfaced like right away
[3:54:50] satanix64: No there's a warning on the box and as soon as you start the game that it's for adults only
[3:54:51] kawaiicrew4ever: i watched my uncle play it as a kid it looked fun
[3:54:55] Returner7: lol iirc they even had to censor a few scenes for the xbox rerelease LOL
[3:55:42] Senoquese: isnt the entire plot of the game just him getting drunk??
