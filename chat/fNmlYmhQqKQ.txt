[1:18:02] JTBun: dolphin is also so easy to run and one of the best emulators out there
[1:18:03] DavidPortnov: 100% correct.
[1:18:05] virgil_dendrict: I actually did emulate fire emblem for a bit but way before the switch
[1:18:06] Superfroakie82: but you need SUPER nintendo switch online to get the gamecube
[1:18:08] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: @navy_mongoose agreed they been making some ccray buisness choices recently
[1:18:11] buruhas: To be fair GameCube is only for the more expensive plan ashton51Wah
[1:18:19] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I've played Sacred Stones, Awakening, Conquest, Shadows of Valentia, Warriors, and Three houses.... I've only beaten Conquest and Warriors.
[1:18:27] Senoquese: dont say switch emulator so loud
[1:18:30] pogotross: om just emulate gamecube on your phone
[1:18:32] yojamjam: path is either on there or announced iirc

[1:19:33] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Yeah that's so dumb
[1:19:36] SantinoHS: Final Fantasy IX IS the new hotness
[1:19:44] Kitkattack: Final Fantasy crowd is so insanely burnt out and disappointed time and time again ashton51Despair
[1:19:50] pogotross: ashton51Sus how many children are you talking to?
[1:19:51] virgil_dendrict: decades of game news hype
[1:20:04] Qrockpot: teenagers would be like "FIRE EMBLEM IN FORTNITE?"
[1:20:07] Blaisevtch: i used to be that teenager a lifetime ago lol
[1:20:10] PSYCOMMUnist: I constantly read youtube comments of parents saying their kids are interested in the games they grew up with.
[1:20:15] The_Qwert: Do not quote the old laws to us, we were there when they were written
[1:20:18] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Like imagine a game where you get the.   While fucking game... no dlc..... no subscription needed.   Wow

[1:20:48] pogotross: Le Wrong Generation?
[1:20:51] Blaisevtch: i hate people like that
[1:20:51] Superfroakie82: i think it literally is the idea of engaging in something new to the world. I think part of it's because theres just so so so much good retro stuff its overwhelming to even think about
[1:20:52] HmmHrmHarumph: yessss dude. You're so right
[1:21:05] redactedenheim: "Lincoln logs were good enough for me"

[1:22:20] PSYCOMMUnist: I dunno' I liked my dad's music as a kid and it took zero pressure.
[1:22:26] JTBun: ICANT
[1:22:28] Qrockpot: LOL
[1:22:33] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Also Survivorship Bias. most people don't talk or let the things they hated stick around.

[1:24:24] Senoquese: you happy
[1:24:26] PSYCOMMUnist: FF6 has Magitek which is akin to the Diselpunk in 7 to an extent.
[1:24:28] InsaneLoke: thats fine
[1:24:28] Blaisevtch: the censored gersion?
[1:24:29] Qrockpot: tokyo mirage sessions mentioned
[1:24:33] rikkaonline: 6 was still 2d, but it started to be a little industrial
[1:24:33] buruhas: They have an even better new FE with a retro aesthetic in the Switch GBA emulator ashton51Nodders
[1:24:33] Blaisevtch: version?*

[1:25:10] hototari: wait was Tokyo Mirage a bad game?
[1:25:10] DavidPortnov: Yoshitaka Amano?

[1:25:11] Superfroakie82: i do often have the mindset that if I'm playing a random old entry in a series i gotta like marathon the entire series for the sake of it or else i wont be doing it right

[1:25:28] pogotross: @Aefen it's okay I only played the one on GBA
[1:25:30] naniwazuni: Dude wouldn't it be really funny if the third fire emblem game was called Houses
[1:25:31] JTBun: IM JOKING
[1:25:34] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: @hototari It was a fun SMT game, but the Fire Emblem Crossover was an interesting choice.
[1:25:34] JTBun: NOT GOING TO SLEEP
[1:25:41] RockLobster52: it was a disappointment because it was marketed as SMT X FE
[1:25:42] Blaisevtch: i think people are just pissed because its censored
[1:25:51] Qrockpot: its definitely a game
[1:25:52] Kitkattack: gn JTB, real fans stay up for ashy ashton51Eep

[1:26:28] Blaisevtch: wait i hope you guys are ok lol
[1:26:29] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, just play them
[1:26:33] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: It's more SMT than Fire Emblem. if you are looking for Fire Emblem, you probably won't like it.
[1:26:34] Senoquese: LOL
[1:26:41] deafmutelaughing: forcing myself to play Outlast taught me to stomach horror games
[1:26:45] JTBun: im not okay
[1:26:46] Navy_Mongoose: maclunky
[1:26:51] RockLobster52: the game itself is pretty decent from what I've heard, but the early marketing really soured a lot of people on it
[1:26:52] deafmutelaughing: because *nothing* gets more gross and jumpscarey than that game
[1:26:55] hototari: I never played it so I have no clue lol
[1:26:57] Graadverg: @virtualoop I honestly miss getting scared in horror games
