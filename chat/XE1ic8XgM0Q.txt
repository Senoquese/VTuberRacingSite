[1:29:52] TheAsterite: and tooie was 60 at launch
[1:30:01] Burr11: especially back then
[1:30:03] TheAsterite: probably 60
[1:30:09] Senoquese: the gamecube released barely a year later after this game, idk why its so padded, if you didnt buy an n64 at this time you still wouldnt because of tooie
[1:30:19] InsaneLoke: video games were really pricey for a bit
[1:30:21] Apache1990: This is when computer stuff was still expensive
[1:30:29] rikkaonline: i would assume 80 was the specialty games, maybe like hello pikachu?
