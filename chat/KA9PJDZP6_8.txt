[1:02:34] PSYCOMMUnist: it's literally like 60/40 custcenes/gameplay
[1:02:42] DavidPortnov: I think that's more RE and Silent Hill.

[1:06:45] Qrockpot: The Ashbox 64 doesnt play it?
[1:07:18] redactedenheim: it could happen
[1:07:19] 십간: surely
[1:07:26] DavidPortnov: Sengoku Basara has a weird history in the West. It came here first as Devil Kings and I don't think we got the sequel, but we got the third one if I remember correctly.
[1:07:29] pogotross: nah they had lead poisoning
[1:07:31] chinfoil: yes
[1:07:33] Qrockpot: never lost it, they just think its cool af
[1:07:35] DavidPortnov: People who have never lost it.
[1:07:35] redactedenheim: or maybe they ate a batch of tweaked mushrooms
[1:07:36] Returner7: I think it's ppl that never lost it
[1:07:50] EmkaZRC: They never lost the chunni in them
[1:07:51] Rocki223ttv: I think part of it is trying to hold onto that childlike silliness
[1:07:52] DavidPortnov: Yeah, that too!
[1:08:00] ApocalypseSC: I think it can be reclaimed and you can find that wonder again but it may take looking into different interest or finding a new perspective
[1:08:09] buruhas: But you watch Sengoku Basara for the yaoi not for the horses
[1:08:11] 십간: stay silly folks
[1:08:14] Returner7: idk Kamen Rider is actually written pretty good... depending on the season lol
[1:08:42] DavidPortnov: I get what you mean.
[1:08:43] Rocki223ttv: ludicrous?
[1:09:06] DavidPortnov: Yeah, I'm with holomybaby. Anything can work if it takes itself seriously.
[1:09:11] keternal: characters turning to the camera and being like Wow that was Crazy definitely suck yea
[1:09:21] olandgren: it's just what they think is right for the product  the winking I assume is like the revolver with SWORD printed on it from the modern interpretation of Romeo and Juliet
[1:09:24] Rocki223ttv: like how sonic used to take itself seriously in sa2, but the things happening were absolutely silly with the context of the characters
[1:09:47] buruhas: Let's go art stream ashton51Alien
[1:09:58] keternal: i think people can make cool and over the top stuff for any reason as long as they are into it with their whole heart and don't stop to be like haha this is cringe
[1:10:07] Rocki223ttv: I LOVE it, it's amazing, I still play that game today
[1:10:39] Senoquese: i love mspaint time
[1:10:42] keternal: sometimes i def get too analytical about stuff but personally when writing i like to be like "i want it to be like this because it's cool"
[1:11:05] keternal: i never feel like i can really extend that to other ppl's approaches or mentality
[1:11:50] olandgren: but no we regularly have arguments over amount of silliness and what will trip an immersion break
[1:12:07] redactedenheim: I had a cat named Earnest
[1:12:33] DavidPortnov: I think I lost you.
[1:12:33] keternal: what are the axes of this thing

[1:13:17] rikkaonline: they fly now?
[1:13:31] DavidPortnov: "There's two of them!?"
[1:13:37] keternal: is it "i cooked this silliness in a lab specifically to be silly but i am sincere about it"
[1:13:52] Red__2: maybe we need a 3rd axis...
[1:13:58] DavidPortnov: @keternal That's what it seems like to me.
[1:14:05] Senoquese: gotta open up blender
[1:14:09] keternal: like we're talkin about "how much they're thinking about it" and "how ashamed they are of it"
[1:14:11] 십간: oof stummy is full
[1:14:36] HmmHrmHarumph: what the hell is this graph supposed to show?

[1:15:13] DavidPortnov: Ok, I think there's something cooking here.
[1:16:40] Qrockpot: Yeah, they want to be silly but are embarassed of being silly
[1:17:02] buruhas: this graph only needs two enlightened chillas on each side and a stupid chilla in the middle
[1:17:05] olandgren: like the horse with handlebars is because  the horse is important to the story and character but a regular horse isn't gonna fit in the modern world, so how do you handle that?
[1:17:16] Senoquese: LOL
[1:17:35] keternal: i think there's the idea of "do you potentially know this could be cringe" on the x axis yeah
[1:17:41] keternal: like on the left they've never thought about it
[1:17:53] keternal: on the right they are no longer Afraid

[1:32:33] Red__2: I like to think so, manufactured artificial sillyness has less soul than whimsy from the heart
[1:32:43] redactedenheim: you mean like naturally silly vs crafted silly?
[1:32:55] yojamjam: imo monty python hits transcendent silliness
[1:33:00] olandgren: god no it's a learned skill
[1:33:04] ReyJaggy: is gigi murin crafted silly?
[1:33:08] olandgren: finding the balance and targeting
[1:33:10] DavidPortnov: @yojamjam Yes! Yes! Absolutely!
[1:33:45] keternal: i think there are approaches to silly that are only possible when you've overcome the shame. there's like an understanding that comes from having experienced the shame and it can color your approach in a way that could even be positive
[1:33:51] Red__2: its rare but a few comedians do that after having a 'I am serious now' phase in their careers
[1:34:11] redactedenheim: if you KNOW how its going to land and you do it anyway then yeah
[1:34:36] Red__2: they were pretty weird from the getgo, they're weird when not being silly now
[1:34:36] DavidPortnov: Maybe you have to go through the middle to get to the one on the right.
[1:35:21] redactedenheim: Dr Marten and the Psychology of Silly
[1:35:33] yojamjam: does anything lie over the hump? or does unlearning jadedness move you left
[1:35:37] keternal: like hear me out i think the left kind of silly will never be acknowledged by people on the middle bc they are too afraid of being cringe, but people on the right side can potentially make a silliness that could touch the jaded folks bc they understand that feeling as well. there's a learned empathy to it

[2:38:29] CoolinMcGroovin: I mean yeah, probably
[2:38:39] roamingtuna: bug catching to “if I catch you you’re mine”
[2:38:44] olandgren: Aomori has way too many bears yeah
[2:38:57] Red__2: the shogun and emperor would get exotic animals as presents from visitors so I can see it growing from there
[2:39:57] thernz: not sure im a primate with how small my brain is

[3:38:11] Poketoa: There's a lot of little things like that to notice in this fight, I'm glad you're paying attention :)
[3:38:26] keternal: no you can dodge it
[3:38:36] Poketoa: You have to block the initial hammer hit, then dodge his attack
[3:39:00] Poketoa: The hammer hit is what knocks you out of green, but you can block it
[3:39:21] Poketoa: You can still take 2 hits
[3:39:46] Poketoa: Wew, 38 heal

[3:42:42] keternal: it gets stronger each time you use it i believe
[3:42:44] Poketoa: Susie healed 42, neat.
[3:42:48] Red__2: the shell does feel like it is homing
[3:42:49] keternal: effectively makes the fight easier each try
[3:43:17] Poketoa: Ah- I was hoping to see if she'd catch on :)
[3:43:37] keternal: i actually didn't know if that was true lol
