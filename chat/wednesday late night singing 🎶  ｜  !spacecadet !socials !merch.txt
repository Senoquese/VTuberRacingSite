[0:26:54] ForgottenBud: Hibiscus tea is really sweet
[0:26:57] noodsdood69: Part of the problem is you're steeping your tea for ten whole minutes Kappa

[0:32:25] Burr11: well the ones that went up on the starliner can't go back on it like planned
[0:32:29] c_v_catullus16: I wonder what their bones look like.
[0:32:30] Burr11: there's other ways down if need be
[0:32:31] RockLobster52: yeah their transport broke down or something
[0:32:33] white_chocolate_heart: huh next time
[0:32:56] Burr11: it's not broken they're just being super cautious about it..
[0:32:58] noodsdood69: their bone density about to PLUMMET dawg
[0:33:01] c_v_catullus16: I mean microgravity causes your bones to slowly lose mass.
[0:33:02] RycegoZ: Their transport was made by Boeing so it's better than coming back down
[0:33:15] RockLobster52: if they can't fix the one up there, another company will send them a shuttle
[0:33:16] vtuberacingcorp: They'll be fine probably
[0:33:28] noodsdood69: They're gonna be like the Martians in John Carter LUL

[0:34:55] vtuberacingcorp: They're on the space station right?
[0:34:58] vtuberacingcorp: They're fine I think
[0:35:02] RycegoZ: Being trapped in space is cooler since you'd be the first to die there (that we know of)
