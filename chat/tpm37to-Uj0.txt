[0:59:49] JTBun: the designs are okay, but the characters arent good themselves
[0:59:52] deafmutelaughing: I mean that's kind of what Jax is lampooning in 6. he wants everyone to be one-dimensional cartoon characters

[1:00:40] Aefen: YEAH
[1:00:51] JTBun: @Navy_Mongoose welcome to the world of fandoms
[1:00:52] deafmutelaughing: Jax's whole thing is that he refuses to accept that the people he's trapped with are real so he pushes people away and pretends he's the bugs bunny of the group
[1:00:53] demon_dandy: Oh wow theyre all 20 minutes thats super impressive
[1:01:03] DavidPortnov: I've got no dog in this race. I'll take everyone's word for it.

[1:02:02] Senoquese: it very much feels like eye candy to me like a 2nd monitor show
[1:02:05] DatBoiVLC: I don't think any of the characters are supposed to be mentally well or always likeable
[1:02:24] Aefen: it feels like they go around in circles every few episodes
[1:02:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:02:31] Senoquese: LOL
[1:02:32] HmmHrmHarumph: LOL
[1:02:35] Romblymo: Idk how many episodes it's supposed to be, but they might just have to rush it
[1:02:35] yojamjam: not the puss in boots
[1:02:37] deafmutelaughing: okay yeah Gangle is definitely a victim of that specifically
[1:02:46] a_raccoon27: yeah, it feels very theater kid
[1:02:47] DatBoiVLC: to be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand TADS
[1:02:53] DatBoiVLC: Kappa
[1:02:54] JTBun: i mean, sure they arent supposed to be likeable, but like... they arent written in a appealing way to me

[1:05:59] DatBoiVLC: the writers are a little too responsive to the community too imo
[1:06:16] DatBoiVLC: it feels like they're still flushing out everybody's character personality is when they still have deep lore they're revealing and it should be set already
[1:06:16] Senoquese: LMFAOOO
[1:06:20] demon_dandy: ICANT
[1:06:21] JTBun: LMAOOOO
[1:06:26] a_raccoon27: It's on netflix?
[1:07:05] Senoquese: i thought the retro game aesthetic they had early on before the first episode was super sick
[1:07:08] Graperial: I can see where you're coming from, I think some of it comes from the writing being very rapid fire, since all we see is each adventure, and not any of the moments in between.
[1:07:14] Romblymo: It did get to Netflix after initial release
[1:07:16] demon_dandy: I liked seeing people rotoscope pomni fighting the rabbit onto that Ted scene that was worth it ashton51Tehe
