[1:28:38] Navy_Mongoose: I use a portrait mod that makes their art look closer to Harvest Moon
[1:28:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cats and dogs get hats

[1:29:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Harvest moon started the genre lmao
[1:29:48] rikkaonline: the NEW harvest moons are bad, the original harvest moon is now story of seasons
[1:29:49] demon_dandy: Uhhh its technically a prequel but red dead 1 is more cowboy, red dead 2 is more frontier
[1:29:50] mushi_buns: love the wii harvest moons
[1:29:54] the_ol_regular: Just make sure your PC can handle Red Dead
[1:29:56] DatBoiVLC: @T33bags harvest moon is now currently not good because the original devs lost the license to the name
[1:30:01] the_ol_regular: To render all those mustaches
[1:30:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: without Harvest moon we wouldnt have Animal crossing and stardew valley
[1:30:04] Navy_Mongoose: stardew is like an upgrade to FoMT

[1:31:03] the_ol_regular: Ash got some cheese
[1:31:05] Navy_Mongoose: but anyway, you don't need to play RDR1, but you do need to play Red Dead Revolver

[5:01:10] chinwillach: I'd try out Half Life but the fact it'll never get an ending really deters me....

[5:01:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Play it
[5:01:43] JTBun: @chinwillach it's worth it
[5:01:45] ApocalypseSC: the speculation is fun
[5:01:53] ApocalypseSC: there's also an unofficial ending by the writer if you want that
[5:02:25] chinwillach: If by unofficial ending you mean the leaked one Valve never bothered trying to take down then yea I know of it
[5:02:27] ApocalypseSC: also half life 1 is fairly self contained
[5:02:28] Navy_Mongoose: what sucks about HL2 is that it's such a suckerpunch
[5:02:30] Senoquese: the writer did later say he regrets writing and publishing that ending so ashton51Tehe
[5:02:53] ApocalypseSC: i still entertain it

[5:03:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Just read gordon x Barney SHITPOSTS
[5:03:21] Senoquese: context is an ex-valve employee "leaked" a script he wrote for hl's ending but he made and published it just out of spite so its not really canon
[5:03:26] Navy_Mongoose: you don't need the leaves to climb it
[5:03:34] the_ol_regular: Yeah

[5:04:25] chinwillach: Tweeleet
[5:04:27] the_ol_regular: So what did we learn?
[5:04:35] Senoquese: he couldnt publish it straight up as a half life script so he changed a lot of details to make it "copyright free" half life, like gordon being a random woman
[5:04:35] chinwillach: Nyahaha
[5:05:04] the_ol_regular: !bomv

[5:05:38] Navy_Mongoose: I guess why ever fall as a bee though
[5:05:43] the_ol_regular: Is Toon Town secretly an N64 game?
