[1:12:46] phatscout: I'm still mad that the flatline doesn't have a flat all horizontal recoil pattern in this game
[1:12:50] smolhamu: vtsympCry how could they do this to ussss
[1:12:58] smolhamu: how are your games goin so far tho? :D
[1:13:17] phatscout: man remember when the spitfire was the most op thing ever

[1:16:13] jdrunnin: wingman to sniper ammo
[1:16:18] phatscout: is the r97 still busted ?
[1:16:21] metaconstruct: ashton51Steer get that w ash
[1:16:22] demon_dandy: thats interestinggg
[1:16:35] jdrunnin: r99 is ok
[1:16:37] demon_dandy: @phatscout forever and always ashton51Tensai
[1:16:51] jdrunnin: r301 is just better
[1:16:53] phatscout: oh wait I forgot they changed in to r99
[1:17:07] demon_dandy: in tf2
[1:17:24] phatscout: it was r97 in Titanfall 2 but it's basically the same gun
[1:17:31] mczub: i think it would be really funny if they added the smart pistol to apex
[1:17:34] jdrunnin: this is literally the build i go for most games
[1:17:38] jdrunnin: r301 spitfire
[1:17:50] phatscout: for whatever reason they changed the numbers on the Rs but every other returning gun had the same name
[1:18:05] demon_dandy: it was r201 if i recall
[1:18:12] jdrunnin: they already added the p2020
[1:18:14] jdrunnin: LUL
[1:18:17] mczub: they have that it's called the l star
[1:18:17] phatscout: oh except the double take, which is now the triple take but it was always a triple take
[1:18:23] Playmer: we had the mozam for like 4 years
[1:18:30] ChessCatUWU: I like pistol guns because "hehe tiny gun go pew."
[1:18:33] jdrunnin: if you like the p2020 you are unhinged
[1:18:34] ArdenYves: Ptwennytwenny ashton51Heh
[1:18:35] phatscout: @mczub lstar can be goated if you're good with it
[1:18:49] Playmer: oh misunderstood, my bad
[1:18:55] demon_dandy: they gotta bring the single shot havoc just for me
[1:18:59] spacechannel4: smart pistol was titan fall 2
[1:19:21] Amai_Umimaru: she's becoming more and more toxic gamer
[1:19:50] phatscout: I was gonna say "most of the shit from this was from that" but that's not even really true anymore cuz they've added 5 years of new shit
[1:19:51] spacechannel4: LUL LUL LUL
[1:20:15] jdrunnin: I always like playing outside of the ring on rings 4, 5 and 6
[1:20:20] jdrunnin: just sit there and hide
[1:20:37] jdrunnin: for some reason I dont win those
[1:20:55] phatscout: my hot take is that this game is about going hard into fights and i don't get people who are like "yeah I like the sneak"
[1:21:05] jdrunnin: no I was busy getting the dub with protag right at the end of worlds edge before rotate
[1:21:06] phatscout: if you wanna spent most of your time hiding just play like pubg
[1:21:19] demon_dandy: im def a KEEL ashton51Steer type of player but everyone plays their way
[1:21:22] jdrunnin: rats are cringe
[1:21:34] jdrunnin: by that I mean in game
[1:22:05] jdrunnin: there was one game when there was a full 3 stack, my team of 2 and a solo
[1:22:08] vtuberacingcorp: ma'am you're a chinchilla
[1:22:11] phatscout: wait are you a mouse or a rat
[1:22:19] phatscout: like spiritually
[1:22:22] demon_dandy: i admire game rats when theyre solo
[1:22:24] jdrunnin: the solo who we were behind and didnt attack rotated around to fight us the team of 2 and then caused us both to die
[1:22:35] Amai_Umimaru: Your fan mark is a rat!
[1:22:45] 0oGooseo0: rodent kin
[1:22:58] demon_dandy: mousey ashton51Baby
[1:23:05] mczub: chinchillin'
[1:23:05] jdrunnin: I use a mouse with my computer too
[1:23:06] phatscout: we're the rats
[1:23:11] jdrunnin: dont know what those have to do with animals tho
[1:23:25] phatscout: I know we're the pitcrew but we should also be the rats
[1:23:42] jdrunnin: say it in voice chat
[1:23:57] Amai_Umimaru: oh yea is there a mascot for fans?
[1:24:00] ArdenYves: jermamites

[1:24:47] jdrunnin: this man does not get it
[1:24:52] jdrunnin: the respawn is already used
[1:25:05] demon_dandy: this spot in the map is my one most hated spot in all of apex
[1:25:22] jdrunnin: he is hard committing to that fight for no reason
[1:25:35] spacechannel4: that's casual online gaming LUL Kappa
[1:25:35] jdrunnin: disadvantaged position and no reason to go there anymore
[1:25:45] mczub: very cool teammates
[1:25:52] phatscout: honestly I only ever play apex in parties for this reason
[1:25:57] jdrunnin: gets knocked and disconnects
[1:26:02] jdrunnin: classic rando gameplay
[1:26:04] demon_dandy: ye this beacon was right nex to the box ashton51Bork
[1:26:08] phatscout: it's just too high stakes of a game to play with randos
[1:26:16] spacechannel4: yeah most ppl feel the same, team mates Kreygasm Kappa
[1:26:37] ChessCatUWU: Real Ducky Momo would have one-shot the entire team.
[1:26:48] jdrunnin: these 2 are nothing if not pro gamers
[1:26:59] ArdenYves: toxic ashton51Bork
[1:27:27] jdrunnin: Yes I do believe they could go pro any day now
[1:27:36] XanderB100: hey Ash, how's it going?
[1:28:14] demon_dandy: lmaooo
[1:28:20] jdrunnin: literally had 2 of those kinds of randos today
[1:28:26] jdrunnin: just random solo dropped and died
[1:28:28] jdrunnin: like why
[1:28:34] phatscout: I'm pretty sure that's against the pro gamer code of honor
[1:28:44] spacechannel4: @jdrunnin LMAO LUL LUL LUL
