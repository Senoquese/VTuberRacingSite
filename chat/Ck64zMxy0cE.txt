[0:56:54] finnab0ing: yeah it looks physically faster
[0:57:02] CINO_p: im sure somebody will keep count
[0:57:06] vtuberacingcorp: Demon's Souls is slower than most of the other games, but Bluepoint juiced the animations.
[0:57:08] finnab0ing: like not just pacing-wise but just faster
[0:57:17] finnab0ing: also could be the framerate
[0:57:22] finnab0ing: I'd be down for a death counter btw
[0:57:35] demon_dandy: eats grass "im like mito tsukino from nijisanji pickychLaugh "
[0:57:44] vtuberacingcorp: It's complicated to explain, but basically the gameplace is near identical but the actual animations _appear_ faster despite hitting at the same points.
