[3:00:54] Burr11: if you play dirt you ahve one tell you the turns
[3:00:55] Echo_81: Rally has a navigator because the driver can't react fast enough to all of the turns because of low visibility

[3:02:54] niertlwal: well group b had less power restriction rules
[3:03:06] niertlwal: the only rule was "you have to make this car available to the public"
[3:03:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah 80s group b was the most unrestricted form.
[3:03:21] niertlwal: this is a really good primer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPk90JZqWM8

[3:37:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @teertaa sure but if the race track requires helmets you follow the race track
[3:38:12] FeetoBandito: maybe the helmet could rip the airbag
[3:38:20] FeetoBandito: airbags are fast
[3:38:20] ToroRosso: Recently

[3:44:50] chiriteer: isnt the reason why aston martin looks so different than from 2000 because they dont like ford used their grill for their economy ford cars ?
[3:44:57] Burr11: 2000s is old it's 20 years ago
[3:45:06] Burr11: as much as i hate to admit, because it makes me feel old
[3:45:09] barfchan: 2000s is vintage 🧐

[3:49:06] TRCGstream: ohhh formula E is impressive!!!
[3:49:18] Burr11: yeah that's the british spelling
[3:49:19] ToroRosso: I wonder Ashton going to watch the Drive to Survive Series
[3:49:37] chiriteer: most car persons around me really hate formula E because the "ew electrics" politics
[3:49:43] AiLoveAidoru: a surprisingly large amount of skill and strategy is involved.
[3:49:43] demon_dandy: ashton51Smile
[3:49:47] Burr11: oh man
[3:49:56] ToroRosso: halo is the goat this race
[3:50:01] TRCGstream: sorry im saying formula e is imprssive

[3:50:18] niertlwal: a few years ago i htink
[3:50:18] ToroRosso: I think
[3:50:21] TRCGstream: e is electric
[3:50:23] JTBun: formula e is all electric
[3:50:26] demon_dandy: Electric?
[3:50:34] TRCGstream: so faster acceleration
[3:50:45] TRCGstream: they can
[3:50:48] AiLoveAidoru: that fire dun look good at all
[3:50:51] chiriteer: formula e is mostly racing on the streets and sometimes rainy streets
[3:50:52] Burr11: why wouldnt they drive in the rain
[3:51:00] niertlwal: he's jammed in there
[3:51:01] ToroRosso: You can see the burned up car in a museum somewhere
[3:51:07] AiLoveAidoru: "oh he's ****ed" YA THINK ANNOUNCER???
[3:51:07] Returner7: yeah that'd be weird
[3:51:18] Burr11: but F1 would have the same issue
[3:51:21] Returner7: it does, but they do race in most weather conditions
[3:51:23] TRCGstream: nah just put on hard rain tires
[3:51:30] niertlwal: they do not
[3:51:32] Burr11: they just change tyres, unless it's really bad
[3:51:35] JTBun: nope
[3:51:41] AiLoveAidoru: i know nascar does (my uncle is a nascar diehard)
[3:51:45] chiriteer: f1 only race on certain conditions
[3:52:00] ToroRosso: During Torrential Rain yes

[3:52:56] niertlwal: back in the day actually some of the races were determined in heavy rain
[3:53:01] AiLoveAidoru: I know nascar doesnt race in rain but from what i remember nascar is a lot more about speed so hydroplaning is a lot more of a hazard
[3:53:07] demon_dandy: What are they tryna say?
[3:53:23] ToroRosso: Freaking Drive to Survive makes it look much more longer then normal
[3:53:31] Returner7: they got really good tires
[3:53:45] Burr11: hm yeah maybe the higher acceleration makes them a little more sensitive  i dunno
[3:53:51] horribleham: It's a miracle how few deaths these sports have
[3:54:02] Returner7: unless track conditions are super poor they usually drive in most weather
[3:54:15] ToroRosso: He would've died their without the Halo and the sheer will to survive to see his family.
[3:54:19] demon_dandy: Album cover ngl ashton51Tensai

[3:54:52] Burr11: crazy
[3:54:54] AiLoveAidoru: i know nascar also uses cars that are just enhanced versions of cars that you can buy from dealers. FE and F1 arent so easily available
[3:54:57] JTBun: suits, cars and all
[3:55:09] TRCGstream: ngl im ready to do rally cross, I got heal tho first NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
