[1:40:57] ArdenYves: i dabbled in the 100% speedrun but stopped because the tech was so frustrating lmao
[1:41:10] Returner7: I was as bad if not worse than you at this game my advice will be of no help lol
[1:41:32] FoxyLoxeigh: I think it's moreso it WAS a great game... Just didn't age well
[1:41:33] AlexRod01234: at this point, it's more rng than skill

[1:46:08] spacechannel4: I don't think they did, prob rush. Dreamcast was like that
[1:46:20] SaintanickClause: does this music simply brainwash everyone into liking the game? is that what really happened?
[1:46:30] AlexRod01234: probably due to time restraints

[1:56:27] AlexRod01234: JSR Community still alive and well
[1:56:30] Returner7: there were a lot of re-releases, plus a lot of Dreamcast stuff was pirated back in the day
[1:56:38] ChessCatUWU: I only ever hear of it because it was in the Sega All-stars racing games.
[1:56:55] Senoquese: game SUX ashton51Bork
[1:56:57] CINO_p: it will be just as clunky, just like the original creator wanted
[1:57:11] Makeit_Hardcore: Opinions on JSRF though?
[1:57:11] ArdenYves: ResidentSleeper
[1:57:16] cakeswindle: doesn't the sequel actually play nicely as well as having the aesthetic?
[1:57:39] cakeswindle: @makeit_hardcore what's your opinion?
[1:57:39] AlexRod01234: I actually would love Ashton to play Bomb Rush Cyberfunk
[1:57:48] Makeit_Hardcore: Definitely recommend. Much better controls, better music, lot of improvements all around
[1:57:51] spacechannel4: part 2 is same jank but runs better so more responsive
[1:58:14] cakeswindle: @makeit_hardcore that makes me hopeful for Cyberfunk
[1:58:53] CINO_p: the roof maaybe
[1:58:55] Makeit_Hardcore: I am VERY hopeful for Cyberfunk and really looking forward to it
[1:58:58] spacechannel4: was there some on the roofs?
[1:59:12] Makeit_Hardcore: JSRF was my childhood and biggest creative inspiration
[1:59:16] cakeswindle: yeah I need it to be good, I love the trailers so much
[1:59:32] cakeswindle: yeah that's it

[2:00:17] cakeswindle: you know what, the indie day of gamescom is Friday, it might show up then
[2:00:25] Makeit_Hardcore: JSRF handles much much better, play it
[2:00:25] demon_dandy: lets hope ashton51Baby
[2:00:33] AlexRod01234: I pray
[2:00:52] demon_dandy: rollerdrome is a good cure too ashton51Tensai

[2:02:01] AlexRod01234: what if same but harder ashton51Tensai
[2:02:05] AlexRod01234: jkjk
[2:02:21] cakeswindle: nobody wind ashton up, she's ready to blow haha
[2:02:23] Makeit_Hardcore: JSRF was bundled with the Xbox along with SEGA GT 2002
[2:02:31] Returner7: yes dreamcast only has ONE analog stick lol
[2:02:36] demon_dandy: it handles better imo
[2:02:57] Makeit_Hardcore: The levels are also better designed around skating
[2:03:07] CINO_p: its like comparing bicycle to a unicycle
[2:03:09] ChessCatUWU: Dang, that was epic.
[2:03:19] AlexRod01234: ok now I understand why this level gives you 999 seconds
[2:03:26] spacechannel4: I thinks it's the water tower

[2:32:51] cakeswindle: haha shut the fuck up
[2:32:59] CINO_p: lmao

[2:34:07] spacechannel4: ps Vita 2 is rumoured, it could be just articles for views
[2:34:09] Returner7: lol idk Sony lost too much $$$ trying to sell those playstation phones LMAO
[2:34:18] Playmer: I think the dollar just got much stronger against those currencies. It is surprising though.
[2:34:25] AlexRod01234: @spacechannel4 knowing Sony... I have no hope
[2:34:25] Playmer: Keep in mind most of these consoles are loss leaders.
[2:34:42] cakeswindle: I guess nowadays the equivalent business wise is the VR stuff
[2:35:04] spacechannel4: @alexrod01234 agree. switch 2.. ppl are raging when that's final announced
[2:35:16] AlexRod01234: ashton51Bork ashton51Bork
[2:35:18] cakeswindle: Well their VR 2 is in marketing cycle now
[2:35:37] AlexRod01234: maybe that's why Sony stopped all productions for Vita
[2:35:42] Returner7: yeah I guess the reality of the situation is Microsoft is making a ton of $$$ outside of gaming and Sony is only making $$$ in gaming mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats
[2:35:43] demon_dandy: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[2:36:20] cakeswindle: Well then again what about sony's TV and electronics

[2:38:58] ArdenYves: put the got damn gaming console in my brain
[2:39:13] cakeswindle: the ps7 will be like the switch
[2:39:36] ChessCatUWU: I never understand the power of consoles and the company stuff. I'm just thinking, funny games on this system and a cool, comfy, controller.
[2:39:41] AlexRod01234: I sure can't wait for the PS20 in like 2050
[2:39:42] spacechannel4: @alexrod01234 that's my fear sadly. I want to play monster hunter freedom on PS4/ps5 lol
[2:39:54] CINO_p: trascend humanity, install videogame brain

[2:41:51] Gaosp: yep
[2:41:51] AlexRod01234: Idk I've never played this game

[2:42:12] spacechannel4: I was thinking 4 but if it's true just boss on 4
[2:42:24] AlexRod01234: Yeah just wrapping up the basics for now
[2:42:40] cakeswindle: @playmer the switch and the steam deck are a console with a screen that you can link to a big TV, in a few more gens there will be no difference between graphics possible on a portable and a high end pc
[2:42:49] Gaosp: this game is for pro gamers only
[2:42:49] demon_dandy: america is actual hell
[2:42:52] spacechannel4: tutorial is by far hardest thing in the game
[2:42:56] demon_dandy: in the game i  mean
[2:42:57] ChessCatUWU: I wonder if the input on this game was different in Japan.
[2:43:19] AlexRod01234: man kids back then were hardcore

[2:44:49] AlexRod01234: Deal
[2:44:50] CINO_p: too much radio
[2:44:54] AlexRod01234: my brain is fried too
[2:44:55] Playmer: @cakeswindle The Steam Deck works mostly because it's a PC and you can scale games way down. Graphics today will eventually look "bad" and people won't accept AAA games that look like this.
[2:45:04] cakeswindle: haha the wide stance
[2:45:06] demon_dandy: no bgm ashton51Baby
[2:45:16] spacechannel4: if I recall.. North America was called "jet grind radio". all version after we're dub correct set

[3:01:24] demon_dandy: hate playing? like the game equivalrnt of hatewatch
[3:01:25] AlexRod01234: ashton51Love
[3:01:42] spacechannel4: jsr & love continue don't mix
[3:01:45] CINO_p: bold statement.
[3:01:47] Returner7: definitely klunkier lol
[3:01:53] AlexRod01234: Rage Quitting = ashton51Bork ; Love Continuing = ashton51Love
[3:01:55] ChessCatUWU: Bad game controls hard.
[3:01:56] Ramathal: going big or cry hard
[3:02:14] cakeswindle: but that's because dark souls is a finely tuned masterpiece and jet set is quite obviously a janky piece of shit
[3:02:18] cametek: tbh if we consider it deep it feels like real thing, like you love the game so much you just continue playing
[3:02:21] demon_dandy: yeye i love jsr but it feels like ice skating uphill ashton51Tensai
[3:03:02] CINO_p: yeah like with enough skill you can overcome any flaw, game still sucks tho
[3:03:11] spacechannel4: jsr is old.. that's pretty much it. they didn't drop millions into it 🤣
[3:03:11] cakeswindle: that's interesting
[3:03:24] FlightyFinch: jet set radio is janky as hell but i adore it to death and i love that era of sega games
[3:03:42] FlightyFinch: especially sonic team games like phantasy star online and sonic adventure
[3:03:48] AlexRod01234: I can relate that to something like Super Mario 64 to this day
[3:03:48] cakeswindle: @flightyfinch yeah same I'd die for sega
[3:04:33] FlightyFinch: i used to think that sonic adventure was bad because of its controls, but now i understand that sonic adventure is *good* because of its controls
[3:04:37] AlexRod01234: close enough
[3:04:38] ChessCatUWU: Yep. Makes sense.
[3:04:39] spacechannel4: @cakeswindle it's hard to agree when launch 06 lol
[3:04:41] AlexRod01234: ashton51Heh
