[1:23:38] demon_dandy: Oh mannnnn
[1:23:40] kyle__senpai: It looks fine
[1:23:40] noodsdood69: infinite stratos isn't bad, it's just like how Accel World got really popular because it was in the same genre as something popular during the time it came out, so people thought it would be as good as the other and it wasn't.
[1:23:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: OUR CHILLA DOESNT SPEAK ITS TRUTH ANYMORE renndogCEASE

[1:26:24] LapDanceDietrich: Brooo I LOVE DomeKano, THATS TRASH
[1:26:51] ZippiBelfast: Shoestring budget
[1:26:55] RycegoZ: Infinite Stratos is junk food anime. Better than most Isekai Anime since Harem's gone downhill
[1:26:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: mrp0p1nfr3sh watched 30 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 30 days chilla at the race track lets gooooo
[1:27:01] demon_dandy: LMAO if he shows up here t33bags im getting my gun

[1:27:08] noodsdood69: accel world got hit with the "This isn't SAO" treatment, Infinite Stratos got hit with the "This isn't like Freezing OR SD Gundam, this sucks"
[1:27:10] TheElfiestElf: ahem... *gestures at Arifureta*
[1:27:21] T33bags: @demon_dandy will a gun even be enough for charles
[1:27:22] ZippiBelfast: I think we're still in the isekai trend, maybe.

[1:29:54] noodsdood69: a slave? Shield hero moment
[1:29:55] rikkaonline: acting like a character pointing out a negative trope as an excuse to use that trope is itself a trope
[1:29:57] fromorra: Looking straight at the camera and shaking my head every time my isekai slave girl's tits bounce around, so the audience knows I disapprove
[1:30:00] MikeFiro: but if i baked a cake why cant i eat it HypeGhost HypeGhost HypeGhost

[5:06:46] demon_dandy: I really liked the blonde girl ashton51Blush
[5:06:46] JTBun: you need to practice mips and the levels
[5:06:49] Navy_Mongoose: I think there's 1 star and 15 star
[5:06:51] JTBun: you can do 60 star
[5:07:06] JTBun: half the game
[5:07:06] ChiaraStellata: The infinite staircase glitch is really hard they say

[5:07:08] Navy_Mongoose: whole game is 120
[5:07:12] JTBun: 120 is the whole game
[5:07:21] Navy_Mongoose: 70 is minimum without breaks
[5:07:23] demon_dandy: 2 hour 120, just gotta watch squeex
[5:07:30] Navy_Mongoose: 16 is BLJ and MIPS

[5:09:13] XxUni_UniversexX: in the 16 star there is 3 blj needed
[5:09:15] Navy_Mongoose: I think 15 star spawns them, then catch them to clip through two doors, then get 16th star from Bowser's submarine
[5:09:20] demon_dandy: itll be  fun to learn all the funny glitches at least LMAO
[5:09:41] Senoquese: thatd be really fun
