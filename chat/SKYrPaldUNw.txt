[0:05:51] Paperguide: no worries ashton
[0:06:07] Burr11: didnt hear the hallo.. its ok though you got enough going on ashton51Tehe
[0:06:12] DatBoiVLC: Sleep is horrible and that's a known issue with Windows
[0:06:17] DatBoiVLC: I actually know a way to fix that temporarily
[0:06:19] Navy_Mongoose: my laptop does that too
[0:06:19] BooDooPerson: oh I haven't seen that one before
[0:06:39] Senoquese: i had that and i redownloaded my motherboard drivers and it worked
[0:06:40] demon_dandy: have you disconnected and reconnected the modem?
[0:06:40] Navy_Mongoose: permanent fix is using lunux instead
[0:06:43] DatBoiVLC: It just happens for whatever reason the record that Windows keeps in the registry for the network device degrades over time
[0:06:48] IgniteDreams: Sleep mode has always been garbage
[0:06:59] Burr11: yeah dont use sleep mode, particularly on a desktop
[0:07:01] DatBoiVLC: You have to remove the device from device manager and reboot your PC and it automatically reads
[0:07:08] InsaneLoke: dont use sleep mode yyeah
[0:07:08] DatBoiVLC: There's a setting in Chrome to save your tabs when you close!!!!
[0:07:11] demon_dandy: give up those tabs ashton51Tehe
[0:07:16] ApocalypseSC: chrome saves all your tabs when you quit but to be safe quit chrome from its menu before restarting
[0:07:19] BooDooPerson: sleep mode is trash, you have to learn weird incantations to reset stuff
[0:07:35] Burr11: there's probably extensions to save your tabs

[0:07:48] DatBoiVLC: At one point I was responsible for keeping over 1,500 piece of shit point of sale machines online
[0:07:49] ApocalypseSC: even when windows restarts itself for updates my tabs stay open
[0:07:52] DatBoiVLC: That happens way more often than it should
[0:08:13] InsaneLoke: my audio interface also resets on reboot
[0:08:15] DatBoiVLC: You need a third party application to lock your audio interface settings because windows will automatically change them when it detects a new device
[0:08:28] ApocalypseSC: if you disable/reenable your network connection that might fix it
[0:08:28] Apollo_Neos: my precious
[0:08:30] InsaneLoke: sowwy
[0:08:30] DatBoiVLC: I fuckin hate windows
[0:08:42] DatBoiVLC: I'll email you my resume lmao
