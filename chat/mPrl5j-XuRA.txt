[1:15:48] ChessCatUWU: I've seen wedding skins come out around there in games too.
[1:16:03] RheaAitken: @AshtonMarten The name June is derived from the Roman goddess of marriage, Juno. Families believed when a couple married in June, they would be blessed with happiness forever.
[1:16:11] RheaAitken: (thanks google)
[1:17:16] ChessCatUWU: This is getting me so excited, I'm gonna start planning my future wedding just in case.
[1:17:46] ChessCatUWU: Yeah, the only thing I thought of is getting married by a body of water.

[1:18:00] RheaAitken: at least no one irl
[1:18:07] ChessCatUWU: Definitely a lot of commitment with marriage. blossuSweat

[1:18:44] HashiriyaR32: Also nice art
[1:19:28] Trent7004: I mean probably no one would wanna date nor marry me. Like I’ve said me being a massive nerd is somewhat a downside
[1:19:51] ChessCatUWU: The lucky few who got to see the cool streams before it was deleted.
[1:19:59] NunyaBizniz: people can smell desperation
[1:20:03] demon_dandy: bein goofy the wave tho, or so ive been told
[1:20:11] gravitypriest: you just gotta post good on twitter and women will flock to you
[1:20:13] Trent7004: Like I think to myself that I’m way too smart that no one would even want to date me
[1:20:39] ArdenYves: geegaPaper
[1:20:39] ChessCatUWU: @trent7004 There's nothing wrong with being a nerd. I've seen some who find it attractive as long as you're nice and respectful.
