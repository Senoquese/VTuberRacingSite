[0:46:40] StarGirlGreen: UNDERTALE IS THE BEST!
[0:47:03] Returner7: they're mostly 2D games
[0:47:17] docthe10th: The M&L games are great, but the devs behind them went bankrupt years ago…
[0:47:35] StarGirlGreen: AT SOME POINT CAN U PLAY UNDERTALE PLEASE?
[0:47:36] finnab0ing: they're developed by a third party
[0:47:47] finnab0ing: but licensed by Nintendo
[0:47:49] docthe10th: They’re Nintendo properties, but outsourced to a third party
[0:47:51] NextTime000: they got absorbed and decommissioned or something
[0:47:55] Senoquese: afaik its like pokemon, its nintendo but they dont make those games

[0:50:15] justcerebro: have you heard of Paper Mario, it's like that gameplay wise
[0:50:18] NextTime000: did you know about Mario RPG for the SNES
[0:50:30] docthe10th: They’re RPGs with some play forming elements

[0:50:46] behoimii: sunny jumpscare
[0:50:57] docthe10th: Platforming I mean
[0:51:08] Returner7: the ._. face I guess
[0:51:18] NextTime000: they are turn based RPGs, but you have action commands on the attacks to get extra damage
[0:51:19] Returner7: not all the mario games are platformers!
[0:51:39] 0oGooseo0: did you ever play the legend of zelda: minish cap?
[0:51:39] finnab0ing: yes
[0:51:41] NextTime000: or action commands to dodge or block attacks
[0:51:57] Senoquese: sorry if backseating, but i think in this next part you should make a save that you dont override, without spoiling it you could basically get softlocked

[3:03:30] american_cookie_1: What happened? I was falling for a woman who has balls
[3:03:44] finnab0ing: @AlyulaCastor honestly I think that's part of the point, it's left incredibly ambiguous so it's entirely possible Sunny didn't truly forgive himself for this
[3:03:46] Nightm4reK1ng: @finnab0ing do you know the Mari jumpscare from bossrush?
[3:03:47] CommanderQball: hwaha
