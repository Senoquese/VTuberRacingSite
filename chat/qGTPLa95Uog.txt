[1:20:41] timinator193: @demon_dandy I remember a comedian always called that "Thanks for incorrecting me."
[1:20:49] Senoquese: you have to reply to random comments with the new audio messages and just not actually answer them
[1:20:57] DavidPortnov: @timinator193 I love that!
[1:21:02] GManx0: She loves those wasp

[1:23:01] MelvinSoupreme: @DavidPortnov uploaders can reply with audio comments on yt
[1:23:26] DavidPortnov: @MelvinSoupreme Oh! Just uploaders. Haven't seen it widespread yet. Just people experimenting.
[1:23:43] redactedenheim: just respond to everything with "wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong"
[1:23:50] DavidPortnov: Oh, that's cool!
[1:23:52] fatcacha: i thought the 5 hour zelda game theories are amazing but 10 hours is insane but i’ve bever played undertale or deltarune.
[1:23:58] GManx0: Do you?
[1:24:11] DavidPortnov: Like diegetic and non-diegetic sound in a movie. That's how I know it.
[1:24:23] demon_dandy: Thats like the low sugar soda type right
[1:24:27] DavidPortnov: Yes
[1:24:41] GManx0: They have Imagine Dragons and all
[1:24:42] Red__2: ashton51Noted
[1:24:48] DavidPortnov: It's a game within the world.
[1:24:54] timinator193: Oh cool, learning new words with Ashton Marten
[1:25:04] GManx0: Tron
[1:25:26] redactedenheim: so we're all bots?
[1:25:40] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:26:25] timinator193: I think she likes Deltarune
[1:26:32] Senoquese: arcane is so unfortunately the best example for diegetic music since the lyrics are still shit like "yeah yeah im a bad girl hmph i punch people yeah yeah 🥁 "
[1:26:48] timinator193: Yeah, he was playing Legend of Zelda at the time ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:26:57] DavidPortnov: Well, I watched a 10-hour Destiny lore video all in one sitting leading up to The Final Shape, so I can easily do a Deltarune theory video.
[1:27:01] GManx0: It is his life work
[1:27:14] fatcacha: ok fine I’ll play the games
[1:27:19] fatcacha: and watch the theories
[1:27:28] JaAmfan: JaAmfan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! ashton51Love
[1:27:29] fatcacha: you convinced me
[1:27:42] demon_dandy: They do love to circle back to old info in depth
[1:27:58] DavidPortnov: I was so close to buying Deltarune during the Steam sale. It's shooting up the list now.
[1:28:45] demon_dandy: The theory i linked that brings up how the text box and the character you play are different entities
[1:28:50] justchiken: ashton51Durr
[1:28:51] timinator193: ashton51Squish no...
[1:28:53] phyzziez: who
[1:28:54] redactedenheim: mike wyzowski?
[1:28:57] HmmHrmHarumph: I'm waiting a decade for the game to be finished
[1:28:58] Senoquese: mike hes the guy that does the game shows on twitch with limes
[1:28:58] azziewatermelon: papyrus knight ashton51Stare
[1:29:00] GManx0: Mike should be a goof
[1:29:03] Romblymo: I'll watch these 10 hour videos and report back
[1:29:12] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:29:13] fatcacha: i just want to say the Megami Tensei series is just as intentional like decades long.
[1:29:20] GManx0: Or just a reference point, not an actual person
[1:29:35] fatcacha: they’re all related
[1:30:12] GManx0: Onion Chan?
[1:30:40] GManx0: He does hate the Word Tsundere
[1:30:45] demon_dandy: Mike rowfone
[1:30:48] timinator193: Ghastor played undertale... and then made Deltarune!
[1:31:00] GManx0: Tsu. Su. Susie
[1:31:11] MelvinSoupreme: WOAH
[1:31:17] redactedenheim: Microphone Wyzowski?
[1:31:28] Senoquese: @demon_dandy ohh ashton marten like the carrrrr
[1:32:02] GManx0: I cannot tell what is Mike, Gaster or Friend
[1:32:15] demon_dandy: Toby fox mad that ashton figured out the takashi miike reference purely by chance
[1:32:40] GManx0: Tragic Straight
[1:32:50] fatcacha: God I have work tomorrow but you got me pacing in my living room back and forth thinking about these things. my adrenaline is kicking in.
[1:33:41] outrunthewind: I think we know why you don't sleep well at night...
[1:33:45] Senoquese: what to do if i have theories i contacted matpat and he ignored me 😔
[1:34:17] GManx0: Out of curiosity, how connected do you think Gaster is to the Skelebros
[1:34:18] demon_dandy: Tbf you reminded me how spamton was legit annoyed with mike
[1:35:23] timinator193: Deepest lore
[1:35:24] GManx0: Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one
[1:35:29] redactedenheim: is it a squeaky wiffle bat?
[1:35:30] demon_dandy: Excited for ch5 this year Clueless
[1:35:47] phyzziez: is sans still ness or did that change
[1:36:05] Senoquese: the whole room in the middle thing

[1:38:30] GManx0: Soft Canon
[1:38:38] Senoquese: there was that censored pic of tobys paper drafts and one of the censors was next to "papyrus has a brother called comic sans and another called" with the exact space necessary for "wingding" according to his handwriting
[1:39:52] Romblymo: Toby sorta wrote the game for people like matpat
[1:40:14] timinator193: That's called lazy exposition
[1:40:22] GManx0: They need to get you NOW.
[1:40:31] timinator193: It's just a bad way of writing
[1:40:39] spikebomb5: most ppl, especially seasonal anime watchers are dumb
[1:40:47] DavidPortnov: Writing towards the lowest common denominator.
[1:41:01] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Toby Fox does troll people, but that's for other reasons
[1:41:03] GManx0: He loves interpretation, like the anniversary stream was all about it
[1:41:10] pantalaimon91: Toby does huge amounts of hidden world building. He intentionally doesn't give all the information but enough to try to piece it together.
[1:41:24] demon_dandy: Toby who left it to the reader to decide whether he thought of it or not
[1:41:26] redactedenheim: but she's not his actual sister, wait, which anime?
[1:41:48] GManx0: He is not a hack, he is just wacky
[1:41:59] chiriteer: popular things always attract discourses
[1:42:06] Senoquese: when he does troll and post shitposts or does weird shit on the streams, they still do have enough real lore in it for that to still be considered teasing
[1:42:12] spikebomb5: having to explain every single little thing is missing the forest for the trees
[1:42:18] demon_dandy: I do worry the gaster character may never live up to the theories if they ever exist
[1:42:28] spikebomb5: ^
[1:42:30] Red__2: but he would be remembered
[1:42:35] demon_dandy: yiik creator ICANT
[1:42:44] pantalaimon91: He's always given off insane hobo that everyone found is actually a writing genius vibe
[1:43:00] spikebomb5: too much time+fan theory brainworms can easily outpace most authors
[1:43:19] GManx0: Like the Chapter 4 boss, but a hand
[1:43:34] chiriteer: me to toby fox lore : im just vibing cluelessly
[1:43:35] fatcacha: are you a superwoman? how do you have time for all of this, work full tome, stream crazy, and goon to yaoi and then have dozens of other skills and talents, oh and talk about the cruise and play deadlock. i can barely take care of myself.
[1:43:35] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah thats moreso what i mean, itd feel a lil underwhelming to see gastor walk in but it feels like thats what people are hoping for
[1:43:38] Senoquese: i hope its all about tenna again, another episode of the game show
[1:43:49] Senoquese: THATS WHAT IM SAYINNN
[1:44:02] InsaneLoke: chapter 5 is gonna be about you. personally.  full name address
[1:44:11] DavidPortnov: It's an allocation of time kind of thing.
[1:44:13] GManx0: Selfishness is a super power
[1:44:19] Senoquese: "im selfish for doing things that i like" okay girl we are just saying words
[1:44:27] DavidPortnov: I'm just bad at not wasting time.
[1:44:28] pantalaimon91: Genuine question, how many hours of sleep do you get at night?
[1:44:42] timinator193: That sounds awesome ashton51Love
[1:44:47] redactedenheim: I spend all that productivity time watching Ashton
[1:44:49] fatcacha: respect.. ashton51Kneel
[1:44:55] Senoquese: so 6-7 hours of sleep?
[1:45:03] olandgren: biphasic sleep schedule let’s go
[1:45:11] InsaneLoke: 🙃🙃🙃

[2:08:11] Romblymo: Yes these are virtual production studios, usually used for CGI work
[2:08:42] Burr11: that would be so cool, theoretically

[2:09:24] Senoquese: theoretically yes, its just a matter of "is it worth it"
[2:09:24] DavidPortnov: It might be scuffed, but could work.
