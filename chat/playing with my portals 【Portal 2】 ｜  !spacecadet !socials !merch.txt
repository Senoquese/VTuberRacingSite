[0:02:04] metaconstruct: oh you already did???
[0:02:04] JaAmfan: it has a chapter select so its not so big a deal
[0:02:08] DatBoiVLC: when it switches from the fmv intro to the actual rendering engine for the game it crashes so more likely than not some configs somewhere is messed up
[0:02:20] rikkaonline: you dont still have the second keyboard plugged in or anything like that?
[0:02:22] JTBun: I was having this same problem. I was able to get it to work by going into Steam\Steamapps\Common\Portal2 & locating the portal2.exe (application) file. Right click & select properties. Go to the "Compatibility" tab & uncheck "Run this program in compatibility mode". Once I did that, it now works fine. Good luck!
[0:02:23] Senoquese: @DatBoiVLC thats why i wanted her to delete the cfgs
[0:02:31] JaAmfan: you can try and delete the local save folder in document

[0:06:28] Dragoon790: @Senoquese That reminds me of a bug on the first Bloodrayne game. If you watched a specific cutscene to the end, it tended to crash the game. If you skipped the cutscene, it would play fine.
