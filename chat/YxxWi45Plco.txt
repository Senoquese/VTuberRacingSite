[1:38:01] JTBun: yeah it was because they were in the vault jsdhgjkdhgsjks
[1:38:09] ZippiBelfast: I think the problem isn't live action or medium so much as it is changing the fundamental story that people loved.
[1:38:23] TheAsterite: Dumbo was tim burton
[1:38:25] dax812: Traditional 2D is also WAY more expensive than 3D
[1:38:41] Burr11: right???
[1:38:47] Burr11: i dont understand people
[1:39:05] katsuragi_kakeruvt: tim burton directed the newer dumbo yea
[1:39:11] Burr11: those people also bash anime as being especially out of bounds, but game of thrones crosses those same boundaries far worse
[1:39:13] TheAsterite: Zemeckis did the Pinocchio remake
[1:39:29] Bookethead: there's only a few studios left that still do the old school 2D animation, I think they're all outside the US

[1:57:42] InsaneLoke: yeah, thats also how they used to do 3d models for CG movies. they would physical sculpt then scan
[1:57:50] rikkaonline: lol
[1:57:59] rikkaonline: in rural parts, no limit

[1:58:35] rikkaonline: thats also only uk
[1:58:38] rikkaonline: (and ireland)
[1:58:43] fontaine_is_dead: 75 not 72
[1:58:44] T33bags: @Kitkattack its more like 50
[1:58:47] InsaneLoke: yeah, model making programs youd have to make code for the vectors so it would take forever to make the model from scratch on the computer
[1:58:49] rikkaonline: 100km is 62 miles
[1:58:58] TheAsterite: disney had a lot of non mickey mouse movies didn't they

[5:28:46] demon_dandy: If she finishes this ep she can just move to ep2, they can kinda meld together
[5:28:50] MintCastella: episode 2 is probably 'bout twice as long and also like 50x better as a game overall
[5:28:52] MintCastella: ep 2 ROCKS
[5:29:03] demon_dandy: Yeah ep2 is pretty much a whole game
[5:29:10] katsuragi_kakeruvt: alyx sniping is me in combat arms :3

[5:31:03] Senoquese: if she plays at the same pace, itll be the same length as ep1, but its harder so she might restart more
[5:31:18] DatBoiVLC: Weed hangover cotton mouth in the morning is fierce
[5:31:27] Senoquese: ep2 is just way more memorable so it feels longer
[5:31:28] MintCastella: i slept for 13 hours and in the middle of that woke up for a minute to take some tums/naproxen with some pocari sweat and passed the hell out and woke up FRESH

[5:33:10] RycegoZ: Champagne is so tasty, got trashed on French .75 in Bermuda 2 years ago. Love the limejuice with it

[5:38:32] RycegoZ: I would've been fine trading Bourdain for Robin Williams
[5:38:35] Senoquese: their intention was to release a buuunch of really short games in quick succession, hence episodes
[5:38:38] Senoquese: and then they immediately gave up on that
