[1:15:55] Trent7004: Ugh 😑
[1:16:11] MeritWD: All the car components are simulated, you can see actual data on springs, tire temps, wheel alignment etc
[1:16:11] demon_dandy: its more realistic than diddy kong to be sure ashton51Tensai
[1:16:16] ArdenYves: the way you plow through fully grown trees is very realistic tobsCOOL
[1:16:19] T33bags: We should test it out by taking us on a real drive in a real car
[1:16:25] cakeswindle: do focus mode and body it then
[1:16:30] Senoquese: oh yeahh i sent the september cover to a friend who doesnt watch you and he immediately said he loves both it and you LOL

[1:17:07] Returner7: irl you want to slow down a bit for turns to increase traction, it's a little un-intuitive
[1:17:07] niertlwal: SHE'S ADDICTED TO THE WORDS

[1:20:19] Trent7004: Go to search tunes
[1:20:23] HashiriyaR32: Press the back button first and hit "Load Setup"
[1:20:25] demon_dandy: car tunes when i pull up in the vanime
[1:20:27] T33bags: Big stretch
[1:20:40] HashiriyaR32: Wait for trent to give you a Share Code for their tune
[1:20:40] Trent7004: Go search my user: Jomemersweat is wat my user is
[1:20:55] cakeswindle: aw

[1:22:02] Trent7004: User: jomemersweat
[1:22:09] Zerorush: Every Forza game gets me to mess around with this tuning and custom paint jobs and then I get bored and never actually play the game lol
[1:22:14] ArdenYves: ashton is still learning how to use the brakes ashton51Love
[1:22:59] Returner7: yeah slowing down irl give you more traction in turns
[1:23:04] Hikari_with_Kremco_Inc: Brakes are important dearie ashton51Heh
[1:23:04] Zerorush: Who needs breaks ashton51Steer
[1:23:11] demon_dandy: despite what the song says, you dont only go gas gas gas ashton51Tensai
[1:23:13] HashiriyaR32: Okay, let's go!
[1:23:22] MeritWD: when you let off the gas or brake, weight transfers forward, putting the weight on the front wheels, giving them more grip for turning
[1:23:23] cakeswindle: "this is nothing like Diddy Kong racing"
[1:23:24] Hikari_with_Kremco_Inc: If you no brake, you will break
[1:23:25] HashiriyaR32: Yeah
[1:23:28] T33bags: Fast race rat Ashton Marten
[1:23:33] Trent7004: I’m just letting ya know this tune is pure sicko mode
[1:23:57] Returner7: lol irl traction and brakes are your friend in auto racing
[1:24:16] cakeswindle: Good luck
[1:24:26] Returner7: yeah you slip the tires a lot when you lead foot thru a turn
[1:24:28] gravitypriest: you gotta watch initial D. they explain all the car physics you need to know to become an invincible tofu delivery driver
[1:24:29] T33bags: Take us skating irl but wear a balaclava to protect your identity
[1:24:31] Zerorush: Ash over here skating around like shadow the hedgehog
[1:24:31] Trent7004: It’s extremely hard to control this car
[1:24:33] Hikari_with_Kremco_Inc: SHE'S LEARNING ashton51Steer
[1:24:47] Trent7004: ESPECIALLY WITH THIS TUNE ITS HARD
[1:24:50] cakeswindle: oh you don't like good luck?

[1:29:13] T33bags: Ashton I’m dying please help the rabies is killing me
[1:29:14] vtuberacingcorp: she's still good for it
[1:29:14] CINO_p: the closer it is to the head the faster it gets to the brain
[1:29:15] ChessCatUWU: ScaredyCat
[1:29:19] Senoquese: chat i think we might need to put her down
[1:29:27] HashiriyaR32: ?@$?@?$@?$@? what in the actual heck!?!??!
[1:29:28] Trent7004: For my sake plz no
[1:29:37] ChessCatUWU: Rip the corn. pockeiCry
[1:29:37] cakeswindle: Hahaha the metal gear ending
[1:30:22] Trent7004: The sesto is the king of X class after all
[1:30:33] vtuberacingcorp: You're going like 150 mph
[1:30:35] HashiriyaR32: wheelspin
[1:30:46] CINO_p: I dont think cars are supposed to bounce
[1:30:59] Trent7004: The sesto is to what people say the best car in all of forza history
[1:31:25] T33bags: Free falling? No parachute? Well I guess I’m dead
[1:31:30] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:31:33] ArdenYves: turn too late, visit god ashton51Love
[1:31:53] Trent7004: Yeah the way it’s tuned is insane
[1:32:02] Trent7004: I made it anyway
[1:32:04] CINO_p: its those violent crashes
[1:32:17] demon_dandy: it is funnier this way ashton51Tensai
[1:32:35] Trent7004: Let’s hope it goes better this time with it properly upgraded
[1:32:36] T33bags: At this point you have like CTE x10
[1:32:36] gravitypriest: YO IS THAT A SUPRA!?
[1:33:08] Trent7004: That how far selection is it just gives u recommended first
[1:33:09] demon_dandy: maybe im wrong but this does seem like a monkey paw situation for trent
[1:33:12] JTBun: everyone complement this pretty chinchilla
[1:33:27] Trent7004: @demon_dandy u think
[1:33:34] T33bags: CTE is something a lot of pro football players have because they get hit in the head
[1:33:45] T33bags: A lot
[1:33:47] Trent7004: I’m in mental pain watching Ashton
[1:33:52] HashiriyaR32: Because they're ALSO x-class
[1:33:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Kneel ganba trent
[1:34:06] JTBun: yes, you pwetty 😳 👉 👈
[1:34:06] demon_dandy: yeah LMAO that one was WILD
[1:34:08] Zerorush: Oh ash didn’t you say someone made a custom paint job of you in this?
[1:34:28] Trent7004: I’m trying not to cringe so HARD
[1:34:30] JTBun: nyooom
[1:34:48] Zerorush: Oh I probably wasn’t paying attention then lol
[1:34:55] MeritWD: X class is too much for me, it's really hard to learn on too
[1:34:59] Trent7004: Sry that sounded insulting my apologies
[1:35:28] ArdenYves: ashton is just instinctively drawn away from the road and into the forests tobsBruh
[1:35:32] draco_0l: I this car required?
[1:35:38] T33bags: I have no idea what’s going so I couldn’t even criticize
[1:35:48] Trent7004: The sesto is the D class Goliath king for a reason
[1:35:49] Returner7: so biker tip -> look towards the horizon to where you want to go, it will help alleviate the sensation of speed and increase your reaction time sorta
[1:35:59] HashiriyaR32: Look where you wanna go
[1:35:59] cakeswindle: roads: optional
[1:36:10] Trent7004: It’s renounced as the best X class car in forza history
[1:36:15] Returner7: it should it works IRL!!!
[1:36:21] Returner7: and for mario kart!!!
[1:36:21] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:36:24] ArdenYves: i hate to see her go but i love to see her leave geegaSmug
[1:36:28] vtuberacingcorp: Ma'am you cannot simply look at your bumper
[1:36:32] cakeswindle: haha no don't look at the bumper
[1:36:35] demon_dandy: so true tohrin ashton51Tensai
[1:36:43] ArdenYves: tobsWICKED
[1:36:47] T33bags: Just drive in a straight line to the end Ashton duh
[1:36:57] gravitypriest: you gotta play f-zero GX sometime
[1:37:06] vtuberacingcorp: This explains so much
[1:37:10] demon_dandy: it says ashton even, see ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[1:37:20] gravitypriest: wipeout is fuckin intense
[1:37:20] Trent7004: What ur stick fluctuation sensitivity
[1:37:36] JTBun: 😳
[1:37:37] ArdenYves: tobsAYO tobsAYO tobsAYO
[1:37:37] TheZouave: BRAKES
[1:37:39] HashiriyaR32: Performing thy YEETUS
[1:37:40] CINO_p: ayo?
[1:37:50] demon_dandy: doin what to your stick? arururUsmug
[1:37:54] TheZouave: use other cars as brakes?
[1:37:56] MeritWD: I think if you want to practice, starting in C, B or A class is easier. Just my opinion. X is a little crazy
[1:37:56] Gatzbie: "Turn Right to go Left." -Doc Hudson
[1:38:03] Trent7004: Point of advice brake when the line turns red
[1:38:16] Zerorush: Split Second would be a fun one to play
[1:38:19] ArdenYves: the line is red 200m away from the corner LOL
[1:38:27] T33bags: You’re gonna send 2 drivers to meet god on this turn Ashton and you might not even be one of them
[1:38:31] demon_dandy: burnout too for stress relief
[1:38:41] Trent7004: Let off ur deceleration when braking u can control ur car more easier
[1:38:45] Zerorush: Burnout Revenge was the best one
[1:39:25] MeritWD: It's not you
[1:39:36] Trent7004: Part of me questions why forza even made the sesto fe it’s way to insane
[1:39:39] T33bags: Don’t worry games are hard
[1:39:42] demon_dandy: are there other races to do?
[1:39:49] CINO_p: :)
[1:39:49] cakeswindle: this seems super fucking hard
[1:39:49] Senoquese: @Zerorush i loved burnout paradise
[1:39:50] MeritWD: No, really. X is not balanced
[1:39:54] Gatzbie: it's like driving on ice. traction just doesn't exist here
[1:39:59] ArdenYves: the track is mean fr tobsCry
[1:40:02] cakeswindle: why is the car going so fucking fast
[1:40:09] Returner7: lol if this is like real life, then you'll want to be smooth with inputs, don't slam brake or gas
[1:40:18] Returner7: you can be fast and smooth just not sudden
[1:40:25] Trent7004: As a fh5 pro, I seriously can’t take this
[1:40:35] cakeswindle: zzzZZIP
[1:40:57] Zerorush: @senoquese tbh I generally don’t like open world racing games. I just want well designed fun courses to race on, I don’t wanna spend time driving from race location to race location lol
[1:40:58] JTBun: Ashton trying to explain nerdy stuff to my dumb seld
[1:41:00] JTBun: *self
[1:41:13] Trent7004: Let off ur acceleration when in the dirt
[1:41:16] T33bags: you are driving at like 230 miles per hour it’s ok if the return isn’t perfect against bots that live for driving
[1:41:18] JTBun: I do like nerdy stuff tho
[1:41:22] Trent7004: U can control ur car more
[1:41:32] MeritWD: Yeah tires have a ideal operating temp, too hot means less grip. too cold too
[1:41:41] Trent7004: Or maybe decelerate
[1:41:47] T33bags: PogU
[1:41:57] demon_dandy: oh yeah havent seen the controller toggle ashton51Tensai
[1:42:00] Gatzbie: are you using a game controller or wheel and pedals?
[1:42:04] Senoquese: @Zerorush truee, i played it more when i was too dumb to recognize flaws in games lol
[1:42:15] Trent7004: Tire pressure tuning I think this car has high response
[1:42:33] Trent7004: I’m guessing ur on automatic shifting
[1:42:33] Returner7: so it looks like your ABS and Traction control light keep coming on that usually means you're moving slower, like i said make your inputs smooth not sudden!
[1:42:45] CINO_p: raging at a game for old men ninoegKekeke
[1:42:45] cakeswindle: this looks super difficult
[1:42:52] demon_dandy: it does seem like a very speed skill race
[1:43:07] T33bags: I bet all of us would hit a wall and die in a car fire and explosion so don’t feel bad about your Forza skills
[1:43:16] Gatzbie: what are games that you prefer?
[1:43:21] MeritWD: the AI cheat tbh
[1:43:21] Senoquese: i cant imagine ever being able to do this, when i played forza it was just to mess around with the halo car

[1:51:44] Trent7004: Track mania is one of the most competitive racing games in the world
[1:51:45] gravitypriest: my favorite racing game is driving my car OSFrog
[1:51:54] cakeswindle: ashton have you thought about executing this race perfectly? I think it would help
[1:51:59] T33bags: What if you do an irl and we found out you’re an actual chinchilla when you accidentally turn the camera around

[1:54:39] ArdenYves: BLEEEEEH :P
[1:54:40] MeritWD: I think it would be faster to chose an easier car
[1:54:46] Trent7004: The average Goliath time is 10-11 min
[1:55:18] ToroRosso: Driving to trees is no good
[1:55:30] cakeswindle: First you need a time
[1:55:33] demon_dandy: those trees had it comin ashton51Tensai

[2:03:43] rex_draconum_: Sherlock Holmes didn't know that the Earth went round the Sun because he believed the brain only had capacity for so much information, and since he couldn't see how it could be relevant to an investigation purposely forgot it
[2:03:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai
[2:03:54] ArdenYves: tobsYAYSPEED
[2:04:02] spacechannel4: @tohrinburnett I'm glad you brought that up. love the cheesetroller

[2:05:30] ArdenYves: you're so good when you're reacting to the race in real time tobsCOOL
[2:05:31] MeritWD: TBH, Forza gives no way to learn how to drive, which is a big flaw. you can find videos on Racing Lines on Youtube and tuning guids like from HokiHoshi to learn more than what the game will teach you
[2:05:35] Trent7004: U want that meta car still?
[2:05:49] cakeswindle: have you ever heard of a game called Racing Lagoon??
[2:05:50] demon_dandy: i just hold the trie

[2:10:14] MeritWD: I got a fairlady Z IRL, it's called 350z in US
[2:10:38] HashiriyaR32: Nah, even in the UK, it was sold as the 350Z
[2:10:38] PolyChromaMeta: polyalToast
[2:10:47] Trent7004: I own every meta car so I know what’s meta and what’s not

[2:26:17] demon_dandy: @senoquese i have a similar thing, i had a bad case of slurring words cause i was a quiet kid
[2:26:30] Trent7004: I could’ve pushed the record even further to get the world record but Ieft my time the way it was
[2:26:57] Zack_Spades: I just stumble over words a lot. Which is funny, because I enjoy talking

[2:31:56] demon_dandy: ofc he does, hes a doctor ashton51Tensai
[2:32:02] Trent7004: U still aren’t doing the braking and exit correctly on the corners
[2:32:19] ArdenYves: trent with his head in his hands
[2:32:31] demon_dandy: NotLikeThis
[2:32:35] draco_0l: @draco_0l No, its my only car rn too lol
[2:32:37] rex_draconum_: Slow in, fast out, right?
[2:32:39] Trent7004: U can ask me for advice, I can give u plenty
[2:32:43] niertlwal: HELLO
[2:32:46] MeritWD: there are videos on Youtube for learning the "racing line"
[2:32:52] niertlwal: listen to me i am the perfect driver
[2:32:54] demon_dandy: monkeys paw curls NotLikeThis
[2:33:05] MeritWD: the line in Forza is really really bad and wrong
[2:33:06] draco_0l: its a general guide
[2:33:13] Trent7004: On the braking zones go wide when entering and in when exiting
[2:33:13] niertlwal: the racing line is the "ideal" strip
[2:33:18] niertlwal: but it doesn't matter
[2:33:20] niertlwal: just have fun
[2:33:22] demon_dandy: KILLLLL ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[2:33:23] gravitypriest: got eeem
[2:33:25] MeritWD: the arrows on the ground I mean
[2:33:29] niertlwal: go fast
[2:33:32] cakeswindle: ong this is just like when gura didn't know what a racing line was
[2:33:38] Returner7: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[2:33:40] niertlwal: the racing line also changes color if you're going too fast
[2:33:52] niertlwal: so if you're going semi-fast it'll go yellow
[2:33:55] niertlwal: too fast red
[2:34:02] Trent7004: When in corners when entering go wide wide braking and inside when accelerating
[2:34:05] demon_dandy: when the race line goes red, that when they want you to use the zipper tech TehePelo
[2:34:12] niertlwal: ohhh
[2:34:17] Zack_Spades: driving fast is all about repetition. all about practice
[2:34:19] rex_draconum_: WOOOOO
[2:34:22] HashiriyaR32: Once you get a bit more confident, you can set it to show only when you need to brake.  There's an also option to turn it off entirely.
[2:34:35] demon_dandy: TehePelo tehe
[2:34:42] gravitypriest: yeah racing lines are a thing
[2:34:53] Trent7004: @hashiriyar32 it’s Bette to actually keep on, every pro does
[2:34:55] MeritWD: it's a helpful guideline, but it's far from perfect in Forza
[2:34:57] cakeswindle: I think it might be a girl thing
[2:35:04] niertlwal: they have racing lines in actual F1 racing
[2:35:06] MeritWD: racing line is the real term
[2:35:08] Returner7: yeah the line they show is a classical ideal race line
[2:35:08] demon_dandy: its in real life ashton51Baby
[2:35:13] ArdenYves: this backseat full af tobs5HEAD
[2:35:19] JTBun: Have a good night Ashton and chat! Gotta sadly wake up to work at 4AM for work tomorrow 😭 Love you guys ironmouseLove
[2:35:20] cakeswindle: maybe Google it real quick
[2:35:20] HashiriyaR32: Okay, I think you can unlock Street Scene now.
[2:35:23] Trent7004: Every pro in the game keeps the racing line fully on
[2:35:30] niertlwal: generally, racing lines are the areas of the track that have the most rubber/traction
[2:35:41] HashiriyaR32: It's in PUrple
[2:35:42] Returner7: but it really is more of a guide, you don;t have to follow it religiously depending on situation
[2:35:47] ArdenYves: gn JTB ashton51Baby
[2:35:47] demon_dandy: laters jtbman, have a good one and hope you alright tomorrow LMAO
[2:35:49] Zack_Spades: Racing lines are a thing in the racing world. it's just means the optimal ways around a circuit
[2:36:00] MeritWD: there isn't a upside to turning it off tbh, it helps make the minimap less important
[2:36:13] cakeswindle: it makes the route as short as possible
[2:36:14] HashiriyaR32: K, now drive to and do the expedition
[2:36:14] niertlwal: you can definitely race outside it but there's tradeoffs
[2:36:30] niertlwal: i.e. less traction/less ideal path
[2:36:31] Trent7004: I’d say use the C8 Corvette for street racing
[2:36:45] HashiriyaR32: NOrthwest
[2:36:49] niertlwal: you should watch the senna documentary
[2:36:52] niertlwal: its v sad but cool af
[2:36:55] MeritWD: there are also other wise to take turns that the Forza racing line arrows won't help with, but those are more advanced techniques
[2:36:58] Trent7004: I’m probably saying this from a pro perspective
[2:36:58] MeritWD: other ways
[2:37:02] HashiriyaR32: Route already set
[2:37:09] ArdenYves: tobs5HEAD
