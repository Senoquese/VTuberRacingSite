[0:05:49] niertlwal: maybe at the edge of your desk
[0:05:58] niertlwal: or at the lip of your desk under it
[0:06:00] MelvinSoupreme: you can put it behind the phone right? it only needs the ends i think
[0:06:01] Red__2: get a pitcrew to hold it up for the whole stream
[0:06:19] Senoquese: thats true
[0:06:20] niertlwal: ya it only needs the sensors at the end of the bar
[0:06:52] Qrockpot: ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy ashton51Dumpy
[0:06:54] redactedenheim: oh many now I want gyros
[0:06:55] Senoquese: " the Wii game didn't use IR, or motion controls at all"
[0:07:05] terralimite: Howdy pitcrew!
[0:07:06] Qrockpot: SKYWARD SWORD MENTIO- oh.... she hates it
[0:07:12] PSYCOMMUnist: What's so bad about Skyward Sword?
[0:07:17] PSYCOMMUnist: Better than Breath of the Wild
[0:07:31] Senoquese: i thought you knew, you mentioned this fact last stream ashton51Tehe
[0:07:31] rikkaonline: motion controls ruined skyward sword imo
[0:07:48] Senoquese: yeahh
[0:07:49] PSYCOMMUnist: Breath of the Wild is the least interesting Zelda to me after Zelda II or CDI
[0:07:57] PSYCOMMUnist: Minecraft Zelda no thanks
[0:08:01] rikkaonline: the game would be like portable zelda short with traditional controls
[0:08:11] fatcacha: @PSYCOMMUnist same
[0:08:28] Senoquese: its that kinda teeth hurting cold
[0:08:28] Qrockpot: oh no have you been biting a lot
[0:09:02] outrunthewind: Wonder where your mind went just now...
[0:09:02] fatcacha: love the gameplay but as a zelda game its weak
[0:09:06] rikkaonline: botw is the purest sequel to the first zelda
[0:09:22] lexycon94: is it contrarian to say that Okami is the best zelda game?
[0:09:24] PSYCOMMUnist: Skyward Sword has a super cool aesthetic and Zelda in the sky sounds really fun
[0:09:29] PSYCOMMUnist: Also good Link design
[0:09:34] DavidPortnov: @lexycon94 I don't think so. Seems like a common opinion.
[0:09:37] PSYCOMMUnist: Breath of the Wild aesthetic to me stinks
[0:09:39] Qrockpot: based okami enjoyers
[0:09:40] rikkaonline: you sound like a ww hater lol
[0:10:01] Qrockpot: TRUUUUUUUUU
[0:10:06] PSYCOMMUnist: Baby blue Link no thanks, Link is Green
[0:10:09] fatcacha: a link to the past will always be my favorite
[0:10:12] rikkaonline: when you talk about botw ruining the legacy, thats what they said about ww
[0:10:14] weary_warlock: hi Ashton and Pit Crew! hope everyone is having a great day
[0:10:17] MelvinSoupreme: i like botw's princess zelda
[0:10:18] kinkonsito: hiiichilla
[0:10:30] rikkaonline: this too shall pass
[0:10:37] rikkaonline: the series is diverse
[0:10:48] Sultansekte: woah a real professionell hater ashton51Smile
[0:11:00] Red__2: WW is a new legacy tbh had its own sequels which were good
[0:11:02] redactedenheim: I have no opinions on Zelda
[0:11:06] niertlwal: passionate hate
[0:11:08] PSYCOMMUnist: I like Twilight Princess best and Ocarina had the biggest impact on me but it's not the same if you're not a kid
[0:11:18] Qrockpot: my favorite zelda is minish cap ashton51Heyyy
[0:11:26] Sultansekte: do you like zelda 2?
[0:11:29] rikkaonline: uh
[0:11:34] Senoquese: i think the difference is that botw is mostly seen in such a bad light because of what happened afterwards, i think if they went to a traditional formula right after itd be seen as cool and unique
[0:11:36] rikkaonline: lol nah
[0:11:39] Red__2: @Qrockpot MC and 2D lovers rise up ashton51Woo
[0:11:42] rikkaonline: theyve already confirmed the next zelda will be different from botw/totk
[0:11:52] rikkaonline: theyre literally the most recent games lol
[0:11:59] PSYCOMMUnist: @rikkaonline Thank God
[0:12:16] fatcacha: did you enjoy 4 seasons?
[0:12:31] lexycon94: anyone else here get their opinion on totk from that one several hour hate essay
[0:12:41] rikkaonline: rofl
[0:12:51] Senoquese: everyone wants to get their takes on ashton tonight
[0:12:57] DavidPortnov: I arrived naturally at BOTW and TOTK not being for me through hours of gameplay.
[0:13:00] fatcacha: @lexycon94 no it’s just not good.
[0:13:04] rikkaonline: youre like the star wars fan of zelda
[0:13:51] Sultansekte: there was an era, where people hyped the first darksiders as the "most adult zelda game"
[0:14:07] lexycon94: totk is not good in its storytelling or worldbuilding. But you can't tell me the moment to moment gameplay isn't really really fun. Yes there's a ton of bad stuff to say about totk but if you strip it down to just gameplay it's a good ass game
[0:14:19] Red__2: Needed more TP aesthetic games it was so good
[0:14:29] StarBurst_Stream: ashton51Wave
[0:14:37] rikkaonline: you dont like zelda, you just like twilight princess
[0:14:52] Burr11: damn she hasnt even started yet and she's yapping
[0:14:54] timinator193: Hi everyone! ashton51Wave ashton51Wave
[0:14:58] InsaneLoke: ohhh you are like a pokemon fan
[0:15:06] Senoquese: @lexycon94 as someone who dgaf about the lore i think its unfair to say "just ignore a big part of it and its good"
[0:15:10] fatcacha: @lexycon94 i agree there. it’s just not zelda coded for me.
[0:15:19] Senoquese: thats what im saying why does everyone wanna get their takes out ashton51ICANT
[0:15:28] Red__2: next zelda needs to get spooky with it and make children have nightmares like it did me, better times
[0:15:36] Sultansekte: anyone remember 3d dot game heroes?
[0:15:42] lexycon94: Im not saying it's good but I'm saying it's not all bad that's all
[0:15:48] PSYCOMMUnist: Bro Tears of the Kingdom is literally Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts
[0:15:48] lexycon94: I really liked spirit tracks
[0:15:53] JTBun: they also reused the fucking map lmao
[0:15:55] Senoquese: maybe
[0:16:02] rikkaonline: the ds games ashton51Despair
[0:16:07] Senoquese: wouldnt hurt atleast to just use a normal controller for this
[0:16:08] rikkaonline: they made skyward sword feel good
[0:16:13] rikkaonline: bad controls
[0:16:15] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul
[0:16:17] redactedenheim: stream hasn't even gone live and she's already ranting, today should be epic
[0:16:19] StarBurst_Stream: ashton51Omegalul
[0:16:28] PSYCOMMUnist: that game sounds super fun
[0:16:32] lexycon94: here's my hot take: zelda should be a girl
[0:16:36] PSYCOMMUnist: why are people so negative about fun little gimmicks
[0:16:37] pogotross: Ok but do you know what's underrated? Zelda 2
[0:16:39] PSYCOMMUnist: people hate fun
[0:16:46] PSYCOMMUnist: I love 3d on my 3ds too
[0:16:49] Senoquese: lol
[0:16:51] Reflow_max: Oh dang I wanted that crossbow as a kid
[0:16:57] StarBurst_Stream: @lexycon94 Excellent rage bait orooCulture orooThumbsup
[0:17:14] rikkaonline: i want to like zelda 2, but the lives system and that sort of dated stuff makes it not fun
[0:18:34] Senoquese: ds and 3ds games specifically love to do fuck ass gimmicks like this
[0:18:39] StarBurst_Stream: ashton51Omegalul
[0:18:44] lexycon94: the best version of zelda 2 is super mario maker 1
[0:18:50] timinator193: That's actually cool tho
[0:18:56] StarBurst_Stream: Technology ashton51Omegalul
[0:18:59] Burr11: was a cool gimmick
[0:19:00] Red__2: That was a filter the devs put in lmao
[0:19:03] pogotross: I wonder if that was anti-emulator tech om
[0:19:33] StarBurst_Stream: Or the gimmick when you had to blow into the mic for things ashton51Pop
[0:19:36] InsaneLoke: can you

[0:24:15] TheMoatman: I like that there are tabs, I dislike everything else about windows 11's explorer
[0:24:16] ArthurWar: I kinda like it more than being required to have individual windows
[0:24:16] Senoquese: thats literally its best feature
[0:24:20] fatcacha: i like windows 11 ashton51Hehe
[0:24:23] rikkaonline: i set explorer to open every folder in a new window so i dont need tabs

[0:41:29] PSYCOMMUnist: Who even said this in the first place?
[0:41:31] Red__2: Judging ashton by her enemies ashton51Nodders
[0:41:36] Senoquese: lmao
[0:41:39] outrunthewind: My first Zelda games were the NES games
[0:41:40] brucewagneto: twilight princess is my all time zelda game
[0:41:56] timinator193: Actual trump card wth
[0:41:57] eb0ss1: tbh it WOULD only be a predatory teacher that would argue over such a thing
[0:42:05] niertlwal: i mean hindsight you had a lot of ways to win the argument
[0:42:06] Sultansekte: will we ever find out epsteins favorite zelda game?
[0:42:09] pogotross: L plus ratio?

[0:42:33] eb0ss1: oh thats why minecraft youtubers are like that?
[0:42:44] Red__2: he has roblox support ticket requests
[0:42:47] PSYCOMMUnist: Twilight Princess is very similar to OoT what's even the difference if you started later? It's not a logically consistent take. At least say something that represents a tangible difference in game direction.
[0:42:49] agroedEagle: Theres proof that epstein made a battle.net account so he more than likely played WoW
[0:42:52] timinator193: nah that's funny as shit
[0:43:05] Sultansekte: at least people logged in his email account now and it's full of roblox support tickets
[0:43:08] pogotross: I hope whoever banned him remembers doing it and brags about it
[0:43:19] lexycon94: it's because wii love ashton
[0:43:19] PSYCOMMUnist: because they wanted families to play it
[0:43:20] bonatide: Osama having anime and epstein being a 4channer is so funny taken in a vacuum
[0:43:20] timinator193: "Wii" would like to play!
[0:43:22] niertlwal: it's oui
[0:43:25] redactedenheim: it was originally supposed to be yellow?

[0:43:28] niertlwal: they love france
[0:43:29] InsaneLoke: voice and text abuse
[0:43:31] agroedEagle: wii=we it was meant to like bring people to play together
[0:43:31] Senoquese: its wii love to play
[0:43:34] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Pretty sure it was for "We would like to play"
[0:43:43] Qrockpot: because they wanted the Wii Nii name locked in for the 2nd console
[0:43:46] HmmHrmHarumph: WHAT
[0:43:49] Red__2: You can't ever say something negative with wii in the sentence and not sound a fool

[0:44:47] redactedenheim: ok, she's legit, I guess
[0:44:47] rikkaonline: yeah you can have one
[0:44:52] Sultansekte: Imagine the teacher is watching right now

[0:46:21] kryvexi: ragebaiter since high schoool
[0:46:27] Fallen92x: I gotta teach my future children to ragebait so they can be safe from teachers like that
[0:46:34] lexycon94: if you don't understand when you're supposed to be quiet it's harder to victimize you

[0:46:40] diegojgl93: Asthon has always been a nooticer

[0:48:14] outrunthewind: And now your teeth hurt
[0:48:19] ArthurWar: The Wiimote jackets that weren't the clear ones were pretty good, like I had the red one that came with the red Wii
[0:48:22] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: The jackets came with the later Wii Motes, but if you had gotten them before they started giving them away you could contact Nintendo for a set
[0:48:23] lexycon94: we should talk about the future. like for example to say a random number 10 days in the future. and if there's any plans going on there or something haha
[0:48:28] Sultansekte: I actually had a teacher that was a huge mario kart nerd. Like obsessive and put a crt with multiple consoles,but they all had only mario kart games in it

[0:50:06] lexycon94: i liked chewing on bouncy balls
[0:50:09] rikkaonline: ashton51Despair
[0:50:15] bonatide: Continue that thought
[0:50:15] y2kkmac: the stuff I messed with as a kid had too much lead in them to chew on
[0:50:18] Orminthebox: yo who got the wooden spoon
[0:50:20] outrunthewind: People are gonna start suggesting chew toys on throne
[0:50:21] lexycon94: yea they break...
[0:50:29] PSYCOMMUnist: I feel the same way about my dad and depression/anxiety. It's like are you a moron?
[0:50:33] Fallen92x: Well from what you've said about your mom maybe it was normal for her

[0:51:13] y2kkmac: AAAH I HATE THAT SO MUCH
[0:51:19] niertlwal: sensory hell
[0:51:25] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul

[0:51:49] Senoquese: its sometimes broken sometimes appears
[0:52:01] Senoquese: it didnt appear on my first youtube load but then after a refresh it showed up
[0:52:06] timinator193: grey yep
[0:52:06] ArthurWar: Oh wow, yeah it is
[0:52:10] Fallen92x: Oh yeah they're right
[0:52:13] nomadicark: hello there, I am here to share dinosaur knowledge and the disappear. is that alright?
[0:52:30] timinator193: its up
[0:52:36] nomadicark: yippee
[0:52:39] nomadicark: in a recent study involving a tyrannosauridae (Tyrannosaurus rex and relatives family), it was found that the rex specime (which was amazingly preserved) had a hole in the back of its skull when the T. rex didn’t.  this had brought back the used to be controversial species of Nanotyrannus
[0:52:39] Red__2: dinos are neat
[0:52:47] Senoquese: its a weird bug its not appearing on the first browser load, if you refresh it loads
[0:52:53] nomadicark: the Loaphis (forgot how it was spelled) was a venomous snake (I think it was related to rattlesnakes) that reached up to 8 feet long AND WEIGHED 50 POUNDS
[0:52:57] redactedenheim: visible to me
[0:53:10] nomadicark: synapsids were Proto-mammals and mammal-like reptiles that ruled the Permian and died in the deadliest extinction event which involved the Siberian volcano traps erupting for 200k years
[0:53:14] Senoquese: holy shit
[0:53:20] timinator193: Damn
[0:53:24] Orminthebox: myraEssaying
[0:53:26] Burr11: ashton51Thinky
[0:53:26] nomadicark: abelisaurs were a family of dinosaur mostly found in South America (but we’ve found them elsewhere like Madagascar), they are known for having taller than long heads which help with vertical bite stress (but sucks at twisting motions). the most famous is the Carnotaurus (The horned boi, horns on its eye ridges)(last one)

[1:00:25] lexycon94: it's really true though like cave johnson didn't even invent anything he was trying to make rings for shower curtains and then got obsessed with the moon and used his money to buy scientists
[1:00:28] Red__2: the folly of men is universal, not one competent man in sight in portal
[1:01:02] Sultansekte: I really like Talos Principle but it doesn't have the portal presentation in the story
[1:01:04] bonatide: They werent consciousnesses, they were nerfs
[1:01:05] ArthurWar: Cave did say "if I die before you can pour me into a computer, I want Caroline to run the place" and we got Glados so he must have not made it to the point where he can be the one in charge or a core
[1:01:14] y2kkmac: @Senoquese yeah they're both dumb enough, I just don't think it fits with the rest of the narrative of the game
[1:01:40] Senoquese: i think its a theory that *could* have made sense like she said
[1:01:41] ArthurWar: It would be!
[1:01:52] bonatide: Caves the goat wdym
[1:02:04] kryvexi: considering the original imagery of glados was a bound woman, i wonder if caroline had a choice of going into the computer or not
[1:02:06] ArthurWar: I do think it's funnier that he's permanently damned to be the one in charge of the workshop maps lmao
[1:02:09] Senoquese: yes
[1:02:11] InsaneLoke: he got hes dick cut off

[1:02:32] HmmHrmHarumph: True
[1:02:35] redactedenheim: now I'm wondering if I ever finished Portal 2
[1:02:35] Senoquese: valve was really woke for alyx and you HATED her LOLLL
[1:02:37] InsaneLoke: they havent changed either
[1:02:43] Red__2: people really didn't care back then
[1:02:44] spikebomb5: having a female lead isnt woke
[1:02:45] lexycon94: you can't be using watsonian arguments to disprove that wheatley being cave johnson would have been cool. in a doylian sense cave and wheatley have similar purposes in the text of limiting glados/caroline's capabilities with their personality
[1:02:46] kryvexi: valve was ahead of the curve and theyre still woke af in deadlock which is based
[1:02:57] pogotross: @Red__2 it wasn't corpawoke yet
[1:03:04] rikkaonline: well we know now that ep was behind gamergate so...
[1:03:07] bonatide: People don't realize how reddit the early 2000s were until they rewatch some of the media
[1:03:09] kryvexi: HUH
[1:03:19] Senoquese: she doylian on my cave til she watsonian
[1:03:19] buruhas: Watson mentioned
[1:03:21] spikebomb5: its in universe vs out of universe
[1:03:23] HmmHrmHarumph: @lexycon94 real
[1:03:30] Burr11: damn thats some sophisticated rage bait with fake words
[1:03:40] Qrockpot: like sir arthur conan doylian?
[1:03:40] lexycon94: diagetic?
[1:03:43] kryvexi: diagetic
[1:03:44] Red__2: you can just make up words and act smarter these days ashton51Despair
[1:03:56] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Watsonian is an In-universe explaination, Doyalist is the explaination from the storytelling mechanics.
[1:03:56] pogotross: the scientology book?
[1:04:06] kryvexi: diogenes?
[1:04:19] eb0ss1: nah the philosipher
[1:04:25] Senoquese: die a jesus ashton51Noted
[1:04:28] outrunthewind: Watching Deltarune theorycraft videos just to maintain the word diagetic in your vocabulary...
[1:04:29] HmmHrmHarumph: she didn't do the required reading to fully appreciate Portal 2 ashton51Omegalul
[1:04:32] 葉梓杰: ashton51Smile ashton51Smile
[1:04:39] bonatide: Dio-genes ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:04:52] eb0ss1: die ah gin knees
[1:04:57] Senoquese: i dont think valve has either
[1:05:06] rikkaonline: rofl
[1:05:06] ArthurWar: Still walking in the corn fields outside the facility to this day
[1:05:08] HmmHrmHarumph: she probably took a nap
[1:05:14] kryvexi: sans is ness
[1:05:14] Senoquese: you should still do that video
[1:05:20] timinator193: Which may or may not happen
[1:05:26] pogotross: that sounds like a tourist video to me...
[1:05:38] redactedenheim: well then you'll love game of thrones the books
[1:05:40] rikkaonline: chell escaped, thats the end, we dont need endless sequels
[1:05:48] bonatide: I think your fujo headcanon muscles flexes itself with a lot more than just yaoi
[1:05:55] y2kkmac: if the prologue is to be believed, chell escaped to a far far future world. whatever that is
[1:06:25] kryvexi: dialysis?
[1:06:39] ajvark: @kryvexi isn't that the ZZZ character?
[1:06:41] bonatide: I think that whatever causes you to make your insane headcanons doesn't limit itself to just yaoi
[1:06:52] lexycon94: diagetic is different!! diagetic is when elements that are usually only perceivable by the audience are actually part of the story and can be interacted with by the characters! watsonian means you're using in-universe arguments to justify something (mario isn't sexist cos he rescues women) while doylian means examining why the author wrote the story that way (mario is sexist because the women in the story never have any agency)
[1:07:01] lexycon94: holy wall of text haha ignore me please
[1:07:02] ajvark: @lexycon94 wow thanks
[1:07:03] Qrockpot: nice paragraph lexy lol
[1:07:20] yojamjam: Essaying
[1:07:39] lexycon94: mario is maybe a bad example
[1:07:49] Fallen92x: keyword "should"
[1:07:55] pogotross: the character and the author I assume
[1:07:56] DavidPortnov: @lexycon94  ashton51Noted
[1:07:57] ArthurWar: Yeah, that's the idea
[1:08:00] ajvark: watsonian means in-universe, doylian means out of universe
[1:08:02] Burr11: because watson is in the book and doyle is outside of it
[1:08:04] Qrockpot: the same story
[1:08:06] ajvark: watson was doyle's self insert
[1:08:09] timinator193: @lexycon94 ashton51Noted
[1:08:11] lexycon94: it's based on sherlock. Watson is a character in the story while Doyle is the author of the story
[1:08:17] ajvark: the original yumedanshi, some would say
[1:08:17] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Watsonian and Doyalist come from Sherlock. Watsonian is how you explain it to Watson in the story. Doyalist is how Doyal would explain why he wrote it this way
[1:08:17] buruhas: you should make fun of lexycon94 using big words
[1:08:21] InsaneLoke: english class
[1:08:22] yojamjam: adding new words to your lexi... your... uh... vernacular
[1:08:24] bonatide: English majors
[1:08:25] ArthurWar: I'd assume in an English class
[1:08:30] rikkaonline: lol
[1:08:34] Burr11: ashton51Omegalul
[1:08:36] ArthurWar: LOL

[1:08:56] Qrockpot: YEah it'd be called Dickian then
[1:08:57] MelvinSoupreme: lmao
[1:08:58] ajvark: @AshtonMarten should we say Flemingian and Bondian instead?
[1:08:59] WertyJess: Hello here to listen to your cute lil' hamster voice
[1:09:05] yojamjam: CAUGHT
[1:09:07] Sultansekte: But we all know Doyle was a hololive fan and that inspired the name choice
[1:09:11] Red__2: who is this Lexi Conn?
[1:09:12] outrunthewind: I think so
[1:09:22] Burr11: twG
[1:09:24] Burr11: yeah
[1:09:27] lexycon94: @Red__2 haha hiii
[1:09:32] rikkaonline: thats when the author gets paid by the word
[1:09:34] Qrockpot: is it White Whalien or Dickenzian
[1:09:35] JTBun: google stream
[1:09:41] JTBun: stream where we google stuff
[1:09:42] Burr11: shakespearian
[1:09:47] pogotross: souls-like tier
[1:09:49] DavidPortnov: That sounds fun!
[1:09:49] HmmHrmHarumph: how kafkaesque
[1:09:51] bonatide: You can see her engineering degree sm rn
[1:10:03] Qrockpot: wait.... charles dickens didnt write moby dick
[1:10:07] redactedenheim: wikipedia readalong lets gooo
[1:10:07] Qrockpot: who am I thinking of
[1:10:12] Orminthebox: @Qrockpot no....
[1:10:16] kryvexi: WORDS man we MADE EM UP
[1:10:22] rikkaonline: this is a very martenesque stream
[1:10:28] Reflow_max: Doylian is what you set the dinner table with
[1:10:41] DavidPortnov: Wasn't that the IGN April Fool's video?
[1:10:44] Senoquese: oh yeahhh
[1:10:48] Qrockpot: The BOTW one?
[1:10:51] HmmHrmHarumph: the wii u thing?
[1:10:54] ArthurWar: They're supposedly done with the BotW world finally so maybe we can get a TP-like
[1:10:58] Senoquese: the files to that demo leaked
[1:11:02] ReyJaggy: Probably a tech demo
[1:11:11] ArthurWar: Oh, was he fighting a big spider?
[1:11:18] HmmHrmHarumph: it was like a tech demo for the wii u and ain't nothing happen with that
[1:11:19] Senoquese: like the realistic looking link and then they dropped wind waker and everyone complained right
[1:11:22] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: There was the Twilight Princess esc tech demo
[1:11:44] rikkaonline: echoes
[1:11:53] rikkaonline: it was a portable game
[1:11:54] rikkaonline: not mainline
[1:12:19] Sultansekte: funny that we now have "zelda cdi likes" that are actually good games
[1:12:22] okamistuff: so like half life
[1:12:34] ArthurWar: Yeah, I'd say that's a fair assessment
[1:12:36] y2kkmac: yeah that's pretty accurate
[1:12:51] Red__2: next zelda will show off the capabilities and purpose of the switch 2 by being a higher price
[1:13:02] Qrockpot: LOL
[1:13:05] kryvexi: TRUE
[1:13:10] y2kkmac: LMAO
[1:13:16] kryvexi: CLOSED world game
[1:13:22] pogotross: time for Zelda Go
[1:13:25] lexycon94: next zelda game is hytale
[1:13:26] Burr11: AI generated game ashton51Despair
[1:13:26] DavidPortnov: They did make that Zelda-focused game.
[1:13:27] kryvexi: same tbh
[1:13:27] Kaynin_Shadowwalker: I would like an open world Zelda that was more like OOT not like the last 2 i dont want lame ass trials i want nice big temples like a real zelda game
[1:13:28] redactedenheim: rails
[1:13:30] Senoquese: i dont think that makes you basic
[1:13:35] HmmHrmHarumph: I just want them to stop making open ended physics-based puzzles
[1:13:35] ArthurWar: I think we can still go back to a more linear game
[1:13:39] yojamjam: zelda is doomed i'm sorry it hurts me too
[1:13:42] Qrockpot: whats the opposite of an open world sandbox?
[1:13:44] res_ipsa_: open world is so played out in general, I'm over it
[1:13:49] bonatide: They add rolling to zelda ashton51Uwah
[1:13:50] y2kkmac: what's the "everything evolves into a crab" of video games?
[1:13:53] Senoquese: @Qrockpot linear
[1:14:07] Burr11: ICANT
[1:14:15] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[1:14:15] Sultansekte: open world + real time stuff like majoras mask with a calender
[1:14:15] rikkaonline: i think you should have more faith in them to still innovate, its literally just the two most recent games and you are doomspiraling directly against what theyve already said
[1:14:23] Red__2: Next zelda will be VN, not quite open world not quite closed game
[1:14:23] yojamjam: have you played many 2d zeldas? lots of meat on that bone, and there are lots of good imitators
[1:14:24] redactedenheim: nah, its not doomed until they make a movie about it
[1:14:42] Qrockpot: They ARE making a movie aboutit
[1:14:47] Qrockpot: REDACTED
[1:14:51] Qrockpot: THEIR FILIMG A LIVE ACTION
[1:14:59] redactedenheim: welp
[1:15:02] Orminthebox: yeah and it's gonna blow
[1:15:11] ArthurWar: I think the only thing we really know is they'll probably implement mouse controls somehow if we're going by console-related innovations lol
[1:15:23] rikkaonline: itll be mediocre to decent
[1:15:27] Reflow_max: Idk it's just they will never make another Majora's Mask or Twilight Princess so how good can it be?
[1:15:27] lexycon94: videogame movies have been pretty good lately!
[1:15:30] y2kkmac: starring Jack Black as Link
[1:15:31] Senoquese: i think the metroid prime 4 devs saying they were inspired by botw, and those botw parts being the worst parts of the game, kinda sours everything
[1:15:32] lexycon94: sonic 3 was fun!!
[1:15:32] DavidPortnov: It'll be perfectly fine. No better or worse than that.
[1:15:40] Qrockpot: how will they make the puzzle solving NOT goofy af
[1:15:41] Orminthebox: I really don't think Zelda translates to a movie at all like people think it does
[1:15:46] yojamjam: miyamoto is too excited to be in hollywood to make it not suck
[1:16:18] Senoquese: yeahhh
[1:16:20] Red__2: what if in the next game ganondorf isn't the primary antagonist and maybe link spends some time with him... talking... going to the goron sauna together... ashton51Heyyy
[1:16:24] rikkaonline: tp is proof that nintendo can do that
[1:16:30] ArthurWar: @Senoquese A lot of those parts were actually the original hands on the game (assumed to be Bamco) and the rest of the game is what Retro couldn't scrub out before they needed to launch the game
[1:16:33] redactedenheim: also disney didn't own the contracts for those characters
[1:16:43] y2kkmac: gotta brainwash the younger generations somehow LUL
[1:16:47] rikkaonline: look at switch 2 specs, nintendo aint changing that fast
[1:16:56] lexycon94: n-no wait twilight princess isn't retro right? it's still pretty new right?
[1:17:01] okamistuff: is the zelda movie live action or animated?
[1:17:15] PSYCOMMUnist: Ashton if I linked you my favorite Zelda video that actually talks about some of this would you watch it? It's one of my top youtube vids ever.
[1:17:15] DavidPortnov: @okamistuff Live-action.
[1:17:22] okamistuff: @DavidPortnov oof

[1:18:03] y2kkmac: @lexycon94 it's only retro if the console didn't use surface mount components. so, NES? retro. SNES? not retro :)
[1:18:05] Senoquese: @ArthurWar they themselves in that article admitted that they prioritized doing an open world experience due to the really good reception of botw
[1:18:06] redactedenheim: tldr, we're right
[1:18:15] DavidPortnov: Time to rehash the Zelda argument once again!
[1:18:24] mikubias: ouhhhh

[1:25:15] Qrockpot: yojamjam i swear LOL

[1:25:23] kryvexi: season 1 fortnite aka fortnite campaign LOL

[1:25:32] redactedenheim: @lexycon94 pee v e

[1:25:43] Qrockpot: LMAOOOO
[1:25:51] JTBun: guys she is not a gamer
[1:25:51] kryvexi: you dont know ANY extraction games daaamn
[1:25:54] lexycon94: the vice president is vp
[1:25:56] Senoquese: extraction means you go on constant runs again and again trying to get items until you die and lose them
[1:26:00] JTBun: she dont play these games
[1:26:01] Burr11: fortnite save the world mode it's called now.. that was what the original game was supposed to be before they made it battle royale
[1:26:02] PSYCOMMUnist: basically you can steal stuff at high risk of dying so the thrill is how greedy you can get without losing everything w/pvp
[1:26:05] okamistuff: pve is like plants vs zombies
[1:26:08] okamistuff: lol
[1:26:08] ArthurWar: We did talk about Duskbloods and that had PvE but it's not out

[1:26:19] Kaynin_Shadowwalker: Yapyap is PVE

[1:26:27] ArthurWar: It's PvPvE
[1:26:30] lexycon94: idk if you're a gamer if you didn't know what watsonian meant
[1:26:36] kryvexi: extraction shooter is high risk high reward and often pvpve game with both player enemies and ai enemies, you have to leave because if you die you lose all your loot and everything you brought into the "raid"
[1:26:43] InsaneLoke: duskbloods? the next souls game? its PVE
[1:26:53] yojamjam: kinda crazy that botw even ruined fromsoft
[1:26:58] Burr11: ashton51Tehe
[1:27:00] Qrockpot: a soulsgame without pvp?
[1:27:01] Red__2: every game is PvP when your fighting yourself to get good ashton51Despair
[1:27:03] timinator193: Helldivers 2 is PvE Ashton
[1:27:05] Senoquese: erhm ashton pvp is like pong
[1:27:11] Burr11: well because you kept naming PvP games and calling them PvE
[1:27:11] TheAsterite: Isn't duskbloods another extraction game
[1:27:12] InsaneLoke: wait why do you hate PVE, i thought you liked souls games. all souls games are 95% PVE
[1:27:14] spikebomb5: @InsaneLoke idk if theres enemies but the description is explicity 8 players and a match ends when 1 is left
[1:27:16] Qrockpot: oh so its a pvpve
[1:27:18] rikkaonline: mario is pve
[1:27:18] ArthurWar: Yeah, it has both
[1:27:23] PSYCOMMUnist: Dark Souls ruined Fromsoft nepuRoblox
[1:27:32] kryvexi: yeah with a pvp mode
[1:27:32] Burr11: sure i suppose
[1:27:33] lexycon94: pvp is like when to men go to the same toilet and they make a v shape with their streams
[1:27:33] Senoquese: i mean yes
[1:27:34] Qrockpot: yes raiding is pve
[1:27:34] yojamjam: mmo is a great pve example
[1:27:35] y2kkmac: yeah I guess
[1:27:47] Burr11: FF14 does have a pvp mode (it sucks ass though)
[1:27:47] y2kkmac: but really, raiding is PvP where the combat is static drama
[1:27:49] ReyJaggy: raid pve
[1:27:51] InsaneLoke: i liked the "mario is PVE" comment cause thats true
[1:27:55] timinator193: @PSYCOMMUnist Yeah, go back to King's Field games
[1:27:59] okamistuff: deadlock midboss be like
[1:28:10] kryvexi: the ffxiv pvp mode sucks but the cosmetics you get from it can be sooooo good.
[1:28:13] rikkaonline: yes
[1:28:14] PSYCOMMUnist: @timinator193 And PS1-PS2 Armored Core yes
[1:28:14] Senoquese: i think ppl use the term pve more when the gameplay revolves around the killing constant enemies
[1:28:15] InsaneLoke: it just means ur fighting bots/ environmetn
[1:28:16] InsaneLoke: yes
[1:28:17] ArthurWar: I'm assuming Duskbloods will end up more on the PvP side rather than PvE by virtue of what players will probably do lol
[1:28:17] Donkler57: yes
[1:28:18] kryvexi: yeah
[1:28:18] Qrockpot: Yes
[1:28:22] Burr11: WoW is the only mmo that really got pvp decent i think
[1:28:24] timinator193: @PSYCOMMUnist Fair!
[1:28:28] kryvexi: so like, destiny 2 LMAO
[1:28:31] Senoquese: yeah thats a more specific genre of pve
[1:28:36] InsaneLoke: okay yeah, you dont like warcraft/ destiny sort of thing
[1:28:37] Qrockpot: so you don't like raid boss gameplay, or hoard shooters
[1:28:41] ReyJaggy: i think nightreing would be raid type pve too
[1:28:45] kryvexi: damn :(
[1:28:47] TheAsterite: Extraction shooters arent like raids
[1:28:52] Qrockpot: do you only like boss fight PVEs?
[1:28:54] InsaneLoke: yeah
[1:28:56] InsaneLoke: thats exactly it
[1:28:59] JTBun: they are not the same
[1:29:04] kryvexi: NOOOO cod zombies the goat D:
[1:29:05] PSYCOMMUnist: I can't stand how spongy enemies are in hoard shooters, the point of guns is that they kill people
[1:29:10] timinator193: What about first person dungeon crawler?
[1:29:12] y2kkmac: I'd describe extraction shooters more like survival games than anything else
[1:29:12] Senoquese: for the most part theyre BASICALLY the same, just combat arms is really worse
[1:29:13] ReyJaggy: you played shadow of the colossus right?
[1:29:15] eb0ss1: i still dont know what extraction shooters are. is it like those junk collector friendslop games?
[1:29:24] Burr11: she just hates everyone and wants to kill them, not work together with them
[1:29:24] eb0ss1: because the junk collector friendslop is peak
[1:29:34] okamistuff: Ashton did you ever do the cod zombies easter eggs?
[1:29:35] Senoquese: you hate david v goliath
[1:29:42] Qrockpot: oh... she would hate monster hunter my comfort game...
[1:29:43] eb0ss1: shadow of colossus or whatever
[1:29:51] Sultansekte: david vs john
[1:30:06] Qrockpot: Goliath vs the 50 caliber sling
[1:30:10] Donkler57: Ashton's stream chat is PvE
[1:30:16] y2kkmac: @eb0ss1, ehhh somewhat. but you have other players also trying to kill you as well as the computer enemies. there's a bit of choose your own adventure going on too, where sometimes you just have gear and you want to go in looking for PvP rather than going in looking for loot
[1:30:24] eb0ss1: @Donkler57 whaddya say we make this co-op ;)
[1:30:25] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:30:36] Senoquese: i think combat arms soured you on horde shooters because i also really hate those kinda games where you dont really do anything but kill for as long as you can, unlike l4d2 where theres so many objectives going on
[1:30:39] timinator193: Where's her health bar?
[1:30:47] lexycon94: ashton's really good at targeting attacks at specific chatters to mess up our formation
[1:30:48] y2kkmac: I play healer, how do I heal chat?
[1:31:00] nomzoogles: WHAT PSO2 MENTION
[1:31:01] Burr11: i have played PSO2
[1:31:01] eb0ss1: @y2kkmac naruhodo
[1:31:06] redactedenheim: never even heard of it
[1:31:07] Donkler57: How do we kill the raid boss
[1:31:09] Qrockpot: no health bar, Ashton's first stage is a DPS check and the stream timer is the countdown
[1:31:11] timinator193: Seno! We need her health bar coded!!
[1:31:15] PSYCOMMUnist: I love PSO2, I hate New Genesis fuck stupid Genshin Impact for killing my franchise
[1:31:16] Burr11: lol yeah they are
[1:31:20] BFlatTV: ur always fighting baddies in that game
[1:31:39] Burr11: new genesis is like genshin wannabe
[1:31:43] Senoquese: awesome skeletor sound
[1:31:43] PSYCOMMUnist: New Genesis is straight up a Genshin clone and came out right at the height of its popularity
[1:31:49] kryvexi: that was a good villain laugh can you do it again
[1:31:55] PSYCOMMUnist: yeah there is
[1:31:58] PSYCOMMUnist: that's the whole game
[1:32:07] Qrockpot: exactly that
[1:32:08] kryvexi: ty

[1:32:09] PSYCOMMUnist: and it's COMPLETELY empty
[1:32:21] InsaneLoke: ugaly

[1:34:12] Qrockpot: does EvE mean soemthing besides enemy vs enemy....

[1:34:53] rikkaonline: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:34:58] Senoquese: @Burr11 its so funny that snowy is such a fundamental part of her childhood but im the one thats memorized the game because of how often i have to remind her what its called

[2:39:51] Senoquese: i still dont like the artstyle but my slander was unjustified this is kinda charming
[2:39:53] timinator193: @Qrockpot ashton51Omegalul
[2:40:15] timinator193: @Qrockpot Names, families, graves, the whole deal right?

[2:41:43] metaconstruct: is there a name for this genre of game
[2:41:50] metaconstruct: (do NOT say shovelware)
[2:42:03] Qrockpot: yeah a pikminlike
[2:42:07] y2kkmac: I think it's technically an RTS
[2:42:07] fatcacha: rts

[2:42:20] fatcacha: baby starcraft
[2:42:50] fatcacha: it had multiple games yet s
[2:42:59] SaiaiChan: it's not really abandonware either
[2:43:03] SaiaiChan: because it's on steam
[2:43:09] Senoquese: this is definitely shovelware because as fun as this looks, this would be sold for $5 at the unwanted games bin
[2:43:09] kryvexi: went out with a fizzle and not with a bang
[2:43:10] rikkaonline: there are even credits for people making this music, i dont think this is shovelware, its a legit game
[2:43:19] HmmHrmHarumph: I think its just good and you can't comprehend that
[2:43:20] rikkaonline: and marvelous is a legit studio
[2:43:27] fatcacha: @Senoquese this if its in the bargain bin its shovelware
[2:43:52] ArthurWar: I never saw this game in the bargain bin to be fair lol
[2:44:05] shindigs: @Senoquese yes but also someone will reupload this to youtube as "frutigier aero playlist" and net more ad revenue than the devs made
[2:44:13] Senoquese: @shindigs LMFAOO
[2:44:20] Burr11: shovelware is more about the development of the game being cynical.. this seems to have heart.. just because it wasn't well received or highly valued doesn't mean it's shovelware
[2:44:38] fatcacha: i call this shovelware with heart
[2:44:48] Senoquese: its a really tough word to define
[2:44:49] Senoquese: agree
[2:44:50] HmmHrmHarumph: its AA
[2:44:54] SaiaiChan: it's called a Videogame, maam
[2:44:55] shindigs: heartslop
[2:45:00] metaconstruct: lmao this studio made a point and click horror game on the ps2 with capcom, thats sick???
[2:45:09] rikkaonline: but what other than the classical music actually makes this seem cheap?
[2:45:19] SaiaiChan: It's basically an indie game
[2:45:27] yojamjam: these are really involved visuals for the time
[2:45:32] timinator193: more slop terms... please more slop terms
[2:45:34] diegojgl93: tragicware
[2:45:43] Senoquese: i feel this was kinda the generic artstyle for kiddy wii games

[2:45:50] Burr11: that could be a good term
[2:45:56] SaiaiChan: nah
[2:45:58] kryvexi: making a new game dev studio called slopsoft
[2:45:59] SaiaiChan: this is Chulip

[2:48:36] demon_dandy: Evil fucking cow.. ashton51Despair
[2:48:42] rikkaonline: the reviews on steam are rough, but it seems to be that port specifically
[2:49:00] SaiaiChan: yes
[2:49:18] SaiaiChan: the steam port is... I've heard at some point they fixed it up, but around launch
[2:49:20] demon_dandy: LOL

[2:49:32] HmmHrmHarumph: that's awesome I'm glad that's possible
[2:49:43] metaconstruct: ya im guessing the chance of being able to cause ACE in this is like 99%
[2:49:48] TheAsterite: Maybe someone will start a gamecube/wii translation layer like Proton for pc
[2:50:15] y2kkmac: hopping architectures is hard
[2:50:17] metaconstruct: asterite, dolphin technically already works like that
[2:50:17] yojamjam: xseed moment

[2:54:34] hooplahound: I LOVED MYSIMS
[2:54:35] rikkaonline: but was it sold in the bargain bin on release, or just to clear stock?
[2:54:35] TheAsterite: It's bargain bin, not shovelware
[2:54:38] Hamblasto: Shovelware is more poorly programmed and unplayable. This is more a forgettable game. Cult classic at Best
[2:54:43] demon_dandy: Sayin that i do wonder what the line for shovelware is cause i played what would be considered naruto shovelware
[2:54:44] fatcacha: NO WAYYYYY sims 2 was the greatest
[2:54:46] ArthurWar: Can't anything can end up in the bin if it stays on the shelves long enough
[2:54:46] hooplahound: i got mysims agents for christmas maybe one of the best days of my life
[2:54:48] SaiaiChan: yeah it's a cult classic
[2:54:56] rikkaonline: shovelware is more about a rushed dev cycle to get it out quick imo
