[0:46:44] Senoquese: yeah just have to tweak the settings more
[0:46:50] shindigs: what did you do with the audio
[0:47:00] BweadTag: Microphone placement can also take time to get used to, you might just be getting more pop from the direction of your breath
[0:47:03] yojamjam: i think it's a bit too compressed. muted trainkun is huge tho
[0:47:03] shindigs: no i think it sounds good
[0:47:11] RedFordFTW: nice audio
[0:47:21] rikkaonline: tbh idk you sounded so good i never thought about quality previously

[0:53:53] flickmannss: sorry im afraid to gamba
[0:53:54] JTBun: I think it sound good, but compressed maybe I'm no pro, but I like to think i'm a bit of a audiophile, and it does sound better but it does sound different and compressed for sure
