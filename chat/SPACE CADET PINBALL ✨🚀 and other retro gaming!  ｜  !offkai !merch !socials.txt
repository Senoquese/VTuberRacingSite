[2:07:21] InsaneLoke: oomfie choomfie?
[2:07:22] SphericalNA: it moves the ball slightly if it looks like its going to go straight down the center
[2:07:30] Burr11: time to find out if ashi is a pinball wizard
[2:07:39] SphericalNA: oh dont worry about counting the points. The missions matter more
[2:07:41] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[2:07:42] TheAsterite: the points don't really matter, you want to send the ball towards the flashing arrows
[2:07:48] Burr11: F
[2:07:51] HDoomGuy: oh yeah it didn't have music in the one that was on Windows XP - it was probably something to do with the MIDI not working or somethin weird
[2:07:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You know if you hit the paddles it swaps the lights so you can fill those top 3 lights ashi
