[0:58:58] kyle__senpai: It's in assembly which is super hard to understand especially for a machine as complex as the N64
[0:59:00] rikkaonline: the code is just the physics and how things work, stuff like polygons and levels arent "code"
[0:59:03] Kitkattack: you cannot "read the code" until you break the source cod
[0:59:05] Returner7: the code is not open source! it's theoretically possible if you could see the actual source code!!!
[0:59:10] chinwillach: Speedrun strats are sometimes found by pure accident. My favorite is the strat for the bonus boss from Dark Souls 1's DLC
[0:59:13] Senoquese: youd kinda need to read most of the code to understand what one snippet does, some people are that dedicated tho

[1:01:07] Kitkattack: the multi dimesional thing is when your speed is so great you leap across the level 4x and the game still thinks you touch the ground
[1:01:09] Senoquese: the code was leaked and there was already a 100% code recreation by the community anyways
[1:01:09] JTBun: people still find stuff here and there, but yeah pretty much perfect for now
[1:01:38] kyle__senpai: @senoquese like they recreated it in C or something?

[1:03:21] chinwillach: Yea he was but he woulda been in the original if things weren't such a struggle. Miyamoto never directed another game after 64 cuz of how strenuous it was for him.
