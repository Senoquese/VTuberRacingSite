[0:56:44] JTBun: you can turn off RTs

[0:57:00] JTBun: also yeah CSM
[0:57:06] T33bags: i had notifs on for bao but she used to retweet like 50 arts which is sick but yeah
[0:57:06] kawaiicrew4ever: csm manga left on another cliffhanger this week grahhhh
[0:57:10] demon_dandy: she really did chain on my mans till I saw clover54Cry
[0:57:13] JTBun: The CSM Anime and Manga are insanely close to each other. They barley changed anything, dialogue and everything. They did re move a scene or two in the anime, but it wasn't super important. They also added stuff in the anime that wasn't in the manga, but it's mostly very minor and like 1 scene for Aki
[0:57:21] american_cookie_1: Chainsaw? man? Yes, I have held both.
[0:57:41] Bentosity: Unrelated. But my bird won’t stop cuddling me and it’s melting my heart how cute she is 🥰
[0:57:45] cosumik: can you hold me @american_cookie_1
[0:58:10] american_cookie_1: @cosumik yes
[0:58:19] beat_shobon: banger song
[0:58:19] cosumik: WAOW! Is held
[0:58:22] breakerj912: I have a question
[0:58:22] demon_dandy: @jtbman i think content wise it is pretty 1 to 1 but its style and direction which I think is where i have thoughts ( I STILL ITS CRAZY GOOD)
[0:58:28] breakerj912: Have you played Gundam Evolution?
[0:58:29] Bentosity: She’s very quiet, she only beeps when she’s cuddling and getting scratches. Or when she needs food
[0:58:34] cosumik: squids39Strong
[0:58:36] beat_shobon: been listening to the pinocchiop and deco27 collab song a bunch lately...
[0:58:46] JTBun: @demon_dandy oh yeah, stylistically, it's a bit different
[0:58:54] Ikerislas: @american_cookie_1  @cosumik  🏳️‍🌈?
[0:58:58] demon_dandy: LMAO ashton51Tehe
[0:59:02] Bentosity: LMAO
[0:59:22] HarrisonFjord: chainsaw mainsaw
[0:59:29] JTBun: I do think Makima is scarier in the anime compared to the manga
[0:59:31] kawaiicrew4ever: fire punch adaptation when
[0:59:49] demon_dandy: @kawaiicrew4ever bruhhhhhhhh ashton51Tehe
[0:59:53] Ikerislas: ManChainsaw how about that
[1:00:10] barfchan: ashton51Spin
[1:00:11] TheAsterite: the anime is a good adaptation
[1:00:30] demon_dandy: I prefer the manga, i still think the anime is amazing but the style and direction I have opinions on
[1:00:32] beat_shobon: anime is a lot more... cinematic, I feel
[1:00:40] HarrisonFjord: it's very safe in a lot of the direction choices it makes imo
[1:00:47] Bentosity: Cheer100 I’ve enjoyed just hanging out and vibing. Don’t be too upset at yourself about going off topic. <3
[1:00:52] JTBun: I love both the manga and anime
[1:01:01] beat_shobon: its more emotional in the calm moments, but less raw?? messy? in the action scenes
[1:01:05] JTBun: even if they are a tad bit different style wise
[1:01:10] beat_shobon: "choose your own poison" with the anime and manga
[1:01:39] demon_dandy: @beat_shobon yeah i think the director really loved the tender moments over the gritty parts
[1:02:03] justcerebro: fujimoto is just insane at visual storytelling, the anime can't hope to match it
[1:02:48] cosumik: The cinnamontography...
[1:03:06] kawaiicrew4ever: mappa moment
[1:03:15] MikeFiro: ok frens it is late and im sleepy tunama6Sleep tunama6Sleep tunama6Sleep
[1:03:25] demon_dandy: sleep well firo ashton51Tehe

[1:03:32] JTBun: @MikeFiro night night ashton51Love
[1:03:48] demon_dandy: i could spit opinions for hours on CSM anime tbh ashton51Tehe
[1:03:56] JTBun: @american_cookie_1 lmao in the first ep Denji is kinda
[1:03:58] demon_dandy: but its still amazing
[1:04:43] JTBun: I don't mind the differences
[1:04:50] kawaiicrew4ever: pogged off when i learned ai fairouz voiced power ashton51Kneel
[1:05:00] demon_dandy: the 3d was really well done ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:05:14] beat_shobon: Without going into manga spoilers and assuming the anime will have a second season, the moments that feel more emotional with Power feel way stronger in the manga because of how goofy she is and looks in the first parts but that's just my opinion
[1:05:24] JTBun: I think the acting added a lot for some of the scenes and parts of the anime
[1:05:34] kawaiicrew4ever: YEA
[1:05:48] cosumik: cosumiCry
[1:05:57] demon_dandy: I heard it was mixed but worth the final stretch, part 6
[1:08:05] cosumik: mumaS
[1:08:06] rikkaonline: its only loading the new layout sometimes for me
[1:08:17] TheAsterite: i feel like 2023 won't be able to compete with 2022 lol
[1:08:21] TheAsterite: for anime
[1:08:24] ajvark: i dont like the new look that much, but it's nice having the table of contents on the side
[1:08:25] JTBun: IMO, I love how they portrayed Makima in the anime compared to the manga. I think she comes off as more scary and threatening in the anime because of the acting and style of the anime
[1:08:32] HarrisonFjord: this has to be the last few days I feel like wikipedia looked normal earlier this week
[1:08:57] ajvark: it's so you can scroll down but still have access to the table of contents
[1:09:24] ajvark: i still havent watched the anime but i still keep up with the manga
[1:09:33] ajvark: (CSM)
[1:09:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Hi ashton and pitcrew
[1:10:01] mushi_buns: 'A corpse is talking...' reading that moment made me sweat
[1:10:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: is this song making chinchilla noises at the begining??
[1:10:14] demon_dandy: i think a big gripe I had was how  the Devils got a lil shafted
[1:10:18] american_cookie_1: Go for it
[1:10:29] kawaiicrew4ever: ahhhh yeah
[1:10:31] Ikerislas: Takes on the absolutely heartbreaking masterpiece edgerunners is?
[1:10:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Heh
[1:10:41] ajvark: that's just how vocaloids be
[1:10:51] demon_dandy: like the bat devil and the future devil looked a lot less spooky
[1:11:19] ajvark: YOU DID IT!
[1:11:25] kawaiicrew4ever: i didnt imagine the future devil to be that goofy LMAO
[1:11:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Chilla echolocation
[1:11:33] ajvark: @kawaiicrew4ever i did
[1:11:38] JTBun: @kawaiicrew4ever I did lmao
[1:11:46] kawaiicrew4ever: but yeah fuji’s way of portraying characters is way more menacing
[1:11:55] metaconstruct: i really should watch edgerunners ..
[1:12:02] ajvark: what if there was a Stummy Ache Devil?
[1:12:30] JTBun: Aki is also amazing in the anime, some of the stuff that happens to him hits much harder when animated IMO
[1:12:52] demon_dandy: stummy ache gorl clover54Pain
[1:12:59] cosumik: mumaPride
[1:13:07] rikkaonline: woah
[1:13:08] mushi_buns: ashton51Steer
[1:13:09] kawaiicrew4ever: basado
[1:13:12] JTBun: never watched Spy X Family
[1:13:15] metaconstruct: ashton51Tensai
[1:13:17] demon_dandy: oof but i half feel ya
[1:13:20] JTBun: never really cared to
[1:13:21] Ikerislas: basado
[1:13:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Im sorry but that song is chinchilla squeaks
[1:13:26] kawaiicrew4ever: kinda fell off for me
[1:13:32] demon_dandy: same kawaii
[1:13:40] cosumik: too saccharine?
[1:14:01] mushi_buns: imo Spy x Family reminds me of Black Butler, they have the same humor I think
[1:14:11] rikkaonline: did you see hinamatsuri? i think it had a similar feeling
[1:14:15] kawaiicrew4ever: i feel that
[1:14:20] ajvark: speaking of comedy, i've been watching/reading Saiki K because the girl I'm dating said I needed to finish it before April
[1:14:32] beat_shobon: I think I got a little baited into thinking there would be an actual kind of dramatic spy story in the middle of the funny family moments when I started watching the anime ahaha
[1:14:32] JTBun: fair
[1:14:36] beat_shobon: so I understand what you mean
[1:14:40] JTBun: that is actually fair
[1:14:44] demon_dandy: it did seem more dramatic ashton51Tehe
[1:14:44] cosumik: Omggg ashton have you seen Acca 13?! cosumiNyoom
[1:14:57] Ikerislas: But hey, Anya is cute
[1:14:58] cosumik: the political intrigue in acca is so juicyy
[1:15:08] HarrisonFjord: ACCA 13 nails the vibe that spy x family should have had
[1:15:21] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Spy X Family is a slice of life anime. I get why its so overly sweet. I think they wrote it from the point of view of anya who clearly isnt conscious about politics.
[1:15:37] cosumik: Acca 13 is one of my fav anime of all time and its so underrated r3myvtCry
[1:15:48] JTBun: there is a reason why I love Gundam so much, is because of the political drama... ITS SO JUICY
[1:15:54] beat_shobon: the anime goes hard with that Yor intro so it feels the potential is there ahaha
[1:15:55] mushi_buns: I do agree wish it would get more dramatic
[1:15:57] beat_shobon: I mean Loid intro
[1:16:05] demon_dandy: the tennis bit is where i tuned out
[1:16:20] ajvark: @AshtonMarten you've seen fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, right?
[1:16:30] ajvark: that's my fave "political intrigue" animanga
[1:16:46] JTBun: FMA:B is great
[1:16:52] demon_dandy: well the manga, i didnt watch the anime ashton51Tehe
[1:17:01] ajvark: @JTBman honestly safe choice for Shonen GOAT
[1:17:13] ajvark: also a lot more digestible than jump stuff
[1:17:20] JTBun: it was one of the first animes I watched lmao
[1:17:23] Ikerislas: spitting cancelable takes huh
[1:17:27] Katryoshka: Did anyone watch the new Reincarnated as a Slime: Scarlet Bond movie?
[1:17:28] cosumik: GO OFF ASH marchx1Clappy
[1:17:30] demon_dandy: im glad spy family is popular at least over other shows LMAO
[1:17:31] kawaiicrew4ever: it all goes back to netflix ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer

[1:18:58] HashiriyaR32: I don't think I've watched any anime since late 2020.
[1:18:59] Basalt_Squirrel: a n i m e
[1:19:00] Ikerislas: Isn't the SxF point to be fully slice of life?
[1:19:06] peachiiipon: peachi52Hiiiee
[1:19:18] HashiriyaR32: Also, I'm back in Toronto as of yesterday.
[1:19:22] Ikerislas: bruh
[1:19:24] ajvark: @AshtonMarten following up from earlier, you mentioned political intrigue, you saw Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, right?
[1:19:26] HashiriyaR32: *back home in Toronto
[1:19:47] Basalt_Squirrel: have you seen madoka magicaa
[1:19:50] JTBun: i haven't watched the original
[1:19:51] demon_dandy: @ajvark i watched FMAB for the first time like two years ago, it is SO GOOD
[1:20:02] Basalt_Squirrel: hecc yeah
[1:20:04] mushi_buns: FR
[1:20:15] ajvark: fair, i know a few others who like the original anime better than the manga/brotherhood
[1:20:15] mushi_buns: early 20 was diffrent
[1:20:18] cosumik: Oh facts
[1:20:23] JTBun: the original FMA opening goes hard lmao
[1:20:31] Trent7004: Hello ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:20:36] demon_dandy: LMAO i feel that
[1:20:39] Basalt_Squirrel: madoka is my favorite anime
[1:20:45] ajvark: I think the coloring of the original FMA anime is a little muddy, but that's an industry thing from the digital transition
[1:20:48] cosumik: ashton51Tehe
[1:20:48] HashiriyaR32: @JTBman Yep
[1:21:12] HashiriyaR32: I only saw the Madoka movies (both the 2 recaps and the continuation movie)
[1:21:23] ajvark: full metal panic is like the key example of that
[1:21:23] JTBun: Gundam is my go to political drama show series lmao
[1:21:29] ajvark: season 1, not the kyo ani stuff
[1:21:32] HashiriyaR32: I actually watched the continuation movie during its North American theatre run (winter 2013)
[1:21:46] cosumik: i dont expect you to have, but have u watched Space brothers? kinda unrelated to all of this but another underrated fave of mine cosumiPet
[1:21:54] demon_dandy: its like the jojo ovas having cool character actions compared to david pro doing jojo shot for shot
[1:21:55] Ikerislas: oh yeah I'm premiering my new earphones with your stream so this is nice ashton51Love
[1:22:04] r3mylupin: Promare in theatre

[1:22:24] cosumik: i went to france to see promare in theaters LOL
[1:22:25] mushi_buns: i saw promare like 10 times ;o;
[1:22:35] demon_dandy: NICE cosu ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:22:38] HarrisonFjord: I saw the Macross Frontier movies in theaters and god they were so much more insane in a theater setting
[1:22:51] ajvark: RIP Billy Kametz
[1:23:05] cosumik: YA IT DIDNT SHOW ANYWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE
[1:23:07] ajvark: i dont watch dubs usually but he did a great job as Galo
[1:23:11] cosumik: Until much later
[1:23:12] Basalt_Squirrel: may i share a hot anime take of mine
[1:23:43] Basalt_Squirrel: i hate death note, its really boring
[1:23:45] ajvark: i didn't mean to sour the mood, my bad
[1:23:45] demon_dandy: LMAO we aint makin it to winter clover54Pain
[1:23:47] cosumik: Watched it in japanese with french subs (i do not speak french SHDHSHD)
[1:23:53] Basalt_Squirrel: d tier anime
[1:23:59] JTBun: @demon_dandy lmao
[1:24:01] Ikerislas: heating up the room with all of this takes
[1:24:15] rikkaonline: d tier take lol
[1:24:21] demon_dandy: different strokes different folks ashton51Tehe
[1:24:27] HarrisonFjord: death note is pure kino
[1:24:27] cosumik: ashton51Tehe
[1:24:30] ajvark: @basalt_squirrel have you watched Columbo or American Psycho?
[1:24:30] Basalt_Squirrel: lmao fair enough
[1:24:47] cosumik: COLUMBO SOSKFIKAJFKS
[1:24:48] rikkaonline: the second half was definitely less good
[1:24:49] JTBun: ayyyy so how about blue lock Kappa
[1:25:02] demon_dandy: i remember watchin with my cousin and it got to the feet washing scene clover54Pain
[1:25:12] ajvark: I remember reading that the DN manga drags in the middle because the author wanted it to be 108 chapters
[1:25:39] rikkaonline: just according to keikaku was one of the top anime moments
[1:25:45] Basalt_Squirrel: i came to it from fairy tail, so it was way to uneventful for me, mightve made a big difference
[1:25:53] demon_dandy: I do have a bit of a soft spot for melo ashton51Tehe
[1:26:12] ajvark: Obata was the artist, not the writer
[1:26:23] demon_dandy: arent they a duo
[1:26:36] ajvark: yeah
[1:26:57] demon_dandy: they did bakuman which is very pog imo ashton51Baby
[1:27:17] ajvark: hikaru no go wasn't the same writer
[1:27:19] Kitkattack: death note is bleghh
[1:27:20] justcerebro: I'm kinda bad at watching anime, I missed out on a lot of stuff that was big back then out of pure laziness
[1:27:21] FellyVT: Hey Ash!
[1:27:25] ajvark: unless you're talking about from the art perspective
[1:27:31] mushi_buns: the only thing I know of Bakuman was the '
[1:27:33] mushi_buns: oop
[1:27:46] mushi_buns: 'women cant draw manga' bit
[1:27:46] Basalt_Squirrel: im a huge magical girl anime fan, so death note is far off my radar too.  actually putting thought into it, death note just really isnt my style lol
[1:28:06] justcerebro: I make up for it by watching shitty obscure anime now
[1:28:22] demon_dandy: @2am_buns bakuman is pog but it is very evident they are not very good at writing women ashton51Tehe
[1:28:27] rikkaonline: given the different content, it was crazy how they made bakuman entertaining the same way that death note was
[1:28:41] FellyVT: And that was 13 years ago.
[1:28:47] Trent7004: Tbh I’ve only ever watched ONE anime series and that’s it
[1:28:52] Ikerislas: almost one and a half hours of stream now, time flieeees
[1:28:58] cosumik: @justcerebro i love shitty obscure shit pls giv recs
[1:29:04] Basalt_Squirrel: w13Notes
[1:29:09] Basalt_Squirrel: im down
[1:29:22] Kitkattack: I just can't enjoy the whole angle of Death Note just making light some demented hero
[1:29:33] Basalt_Squirrel: i watched highschool of the dead so i can survive anything
[1:29:40] Kitkattack: It's just so demented and disturbing
[1:29:51] rikkaonline: its supposed to be - they didnt want people to like light
[1:29:53] demon_dandy: yeah but lights laugh is iconic ashton51Baby
[1:29:57] FellyVT: No lie, I was aware of anime at the time like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, and Kenshin were goin on in Japan.
[1:30:07] JTBun: I've heard blue lock is great
[1:30:24] ajvark: i hope the new Akira anime comes out this decade; I see the volumes on sale in local stores but they're all flipped :(
[1:30:26] FellyVT: I knowwwww
[1:30:32] Kitkattack: no I'll play violent games and stuff but stuff like the game "Manhunt" goes to far, jsut makes you feel like a serial killer
[1:30:34] kawaiicrew4ever: ashton51Baby
[1:30:36] Zerorush: I haven’t kept up with anime in so long. I need like, k-on season 2 to bring me back

[1:31:55] Zerorush: I’m an old enough weeb to remember the world before Dragonball exploded in the west
[1:32:11] ajvark: jotaro
[1:32:17] FellyVT: I think the most recent show I finished was the 2nd season of Yuru Camp (Laid Back Camp)

[1:33:45] Zerorush: I remember watching DBZ on bootleg VHS tapes before it got an official dub haha
[1:33:51] mushi_buns: love yuru camp!!!! have to watch the movie soon
[1:33:52] HarrisonFjord: yuru camp convinced all my indoorsy friends to go camping in college
[1:33:57] Zerorush: My older cousin would import them
[1:33:57] FellyVT: Its a Spice of Life show at its core and I adore it.
[1:33:58] ajvark: i think i annoyed several people into watching Jojo back in high school
[1:33:58] Kitkattack: I'm all about camping but Yuru Camp isn't the slice o' life for me
[1:34:01] T33bags: there werent very many latino kids in your school if there werent many that liked dbz
[1:34:17] FellyVT: Also I enjoyed camping as a kid and want to do it again someday.
[1:34:20] demon_dandy: once i watch yuru camp movie... its all over clover54Pien
[1:34:21] Ikerislas: Wait no way i fucking love this song I LUV IT

[1:36:09] demon_dandy: bocchi was sooo bingeable
[1:36:10] Ikerislas: We "talking" about anime more like getting side tracked and giving HOT takes, so get comfortable with the wheel ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[1:36:12] Zerorush: An important question Ash. What season of pretty cure is your favorite
[1:36:19] Trent7004: THX HAM, BYE
[1:36:20] rikinyanko: bocchi is so good im really enjoying it!

[1:36:27] demon_dandy: have a good one ham ashton51Tehe
[1:36:44] Trent7004: That’s my 3rd time being subbed Pog
[1:36:52] demon_dandy: I READ bocchi so I didnt expect this from the anime at alllll
[1:37:16] Ikerislas: Dis song so gud
[1:37:24] Zerorush: Heartcatch is a good answer. A lot of peoples favorite
[1:37:32] JTBun: Bocchi is such a unique adaptation
[1:37:49] kawaiicrew4ever: yea it's nice that bocchi has substance beyond the band stuff
[1:37:50] Zerorush: I’m fond of Smile pretty cure and Princess ashton51Tensai
[1:38:19] mushi_buns: oh boy I watched Supercub and it was way to much a bore
[1:38:21] demon_dandy: all the bocchi characters could be mc if they wanted
[1:39:01] JulianoUchoa: We discussing animes?
[1:39:04] JulianoUchoa: What animes?
[1:39:07] rikinyanko: !lurk i will be chilling here but i gotta eat a burrito lol!!! ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:39:07] StreamElements: RikiNyanko is a sneaky squeaky lurky lil mouse!
[1:39:21] demon_dandy: have a good meal riki ashton51Tehe
[1:39:21] Zerorush: Anime peaked at Nichijou
[1:39:31] Ikerislas: I know nothing about bochi, i just kinda have the vage idea it's about an anxious gae cute musical girl and her friends? i only guess from the fan art lmao
[1:39:31] T33bags: honestly thought it was eichii before i saw a clip because of the fanart lmaoooo
[1:39:33] rikinyanko: @demon_dandy ty!! <3
[1:39:53] JTBun: @Ikerislas yeah, but's really amazing and unny
[1:39:55] JTBun: *funny
[1:39:55] demon_dandy: @zerorush this might be true ashton51Tensai
[1:40:02] Trent7004: Have a good one Riki <3 <3
[1:40:11] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:40:20] american_cookie_1: Holy shit fly fishing
[1:40:21] Trent7004: lmao
[1:40:22] demon_dandy: it was like easy catch or something
[1:40:28] T33bags: also bocci the rock is honestly insane in animation because they animated the characters actually playing their part (for the most part) the animation is spot on
[1:40:28] american_cookie_1: I wanna go fishing now
[1:40:33] kawaiicrew4ever: i'm starting to understand why i couldn't get into DIY
[1:40:46] kawaiicrew4ever: (the anime)
[1:40:55] HarrisonFjord: I feel like a lot of those shows distill into "TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT [HOBBY]" and I feel like bocchi sidesteps that
[1:41:08] Kitkattack: I found it interesting because I learned a lot, used to bait and tackle so it was cool to see other methods
[1:41:10] Ikerislas: nice, but is it Yuri romance too? idk
[1:41:21] erodozer: "diary of our days at the breakwater" was similar, cute girls but focused on being educational to get you into something
[1:41:27] kawaiicrew4ever: yuru camp looks so comfy so i rlly wish i could get into it
[1:41:34] JTBun: @Ikerislas not really
[1:41:40] JTBun: it's slice of life
[1:41:40] JulianoUchoa: What anime you talking about?
[1:41:59] Ikerislas: ah, got it, got it
[1:42:00] T33bags: also bocci the rock is honestly insane in animation because they animated the characters actually playing their part (for the most part) the animation is spot on
[1:42:04] demon_dandy: i think it helps that music is more universal
[1:42:10] Zerorush: Bakuon kind of had the reverse issue. They didn’t go into the biking hobby like enough I feel? At least for me
[1:42:34] Kitkattack: Slow Loop is the show btw
[1:43:18] Ikerislas: Oh, when do you think you would be doing another racing game stream?
[1:43:36] Ikerislas: noice
[1:43:40] Kitkattack: there's a part of me that get's pissed where they'll put cute girls in anything just for appeal
[1:43:51] beat_shobon: I was surprised on the focus on music that Bocchi has, not even K-ON goes into it that deep (it goes more into friendship and stuff) and there's a lot of small details in the songs and visuals that clearly come from people who love music and bands
[1:43:56] beat_shobon: I enjoyed that a lot
[1:43:58] Trent7004: Did I hear Outrun? HELL YEAH
[1:44:03] Zerorush: You know an awful show that tried to do the cute girls trope? Rolling Girls, legit hate that show lol
[1:44:08] HarrisonFjord: also rather than explain music concepts or techniques like the slide guitar thing Bocchi just shows them and let people pick up on them as they do
[1:44:08] Ikerislas: b-but, they're cuteEEeEE@kitkattack
[1:44:24] Zerorush: Well, rolling girls tried to stuff so many cliches into one show. It’s SO bad
[1:44:36] cosumik: @harrisonfjord i like ur username btw
[1:44:36] kawaiicrew4ever: bocchi's dad best character
[1:44:41] T33bags: they go to a coed school
[1:44:47] Trent7004: I’m a massive fan or Outrun
[1:44:48] HarrisonFjord: @cosumik hell yeah
[1:44:51] Trent7004: *of
[1:44:53] Kitkattack: I say, brain rotted, watching ikamusume
[1:45:05] kawaiicrew4ever: girls?? I WANNA SEE MEN ‼️
[1:45:22] cosumik: Maybe im getting ahead of us but did u watch romantic killer
[1:45:23] demon_dandy: there was the cool dude at the other music den
[1:45:23] TheAsterite: bocchi's dad suffers from hentai male protag syndrome lol
[1:45:26] Returner7: oh dang I was a fan of Yuru Camp
[1:45:33] Zerorush: Rolling girls had an amazing first TWO episodes but it’s legit a trap
[1:45:39] HarrisonFjord: rolling girls has a blue hearts cover soundtrack so it's automatically goated
[1:45:42] Zerorush: The rest of it such garbage haha
[1:45:49] demon_dandy: i still like rolling girls ashton51Tensai
[1:45:51] cosumik: BLUE HEARTS
[1:45:54] cosumik: cosumiHype
[1:46:19] Ikerislas: ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[1:46:24] cosumik: noo its a band!
[1:46:24] HarrisonFjord: nah rolling girls covered a lot of blue hearts songs!
[1:46:27] Returner7: did I miss the Nagatoro discussion??? I'm following season 2!!!
[1:46:30] demon_dandy: nah rolling girls had a bunch of blue hearts songs
[1:46:39] cosumik: But yeah tbh watch romantic killer, it really surprised me
[1:46:39] Ikerislas: I misread that as blue 🔵🔵🔵....
[1:46:42] Zerorush: My favorite anime is Toradora. Judge me pit crew ashton51Bork
[1:46:56] T33bags: bocci has kana boon posters in her closet
[1:46:57] JulianoUchoa: I dont watch good anime in a while
[1:47:28] cosumik: i havent watched anime at all in a while until i started watching stuff w Saku on discord celierPeek
[1:47:36] Returner7: too much music theory?
[1:47:53] Kitkattack: The last anime I was really crazy about was in 2020 when Eizouken came out
[1:48:01] JTBun: it also has unique jokes in it, like some of the ways they change up the animation or art style for certain jokes is amazing
[1:48:15] cosumik: yee
[1:48:22] Kitkattack: just hardcore anime directing and design it's sooooooooooo gud ashton51baby
[1:48:26] Kitkattack: ashton51Baby
[1:48:27] demon_dandy: yeah its crazy thats a 4koma LMAO
[1:48:30] Zerorush: When’s someone gonna make K-on but with Vtubing as the hobby
[1:48:46] FellyVT: Azumanga Daioh
[1:48:49] beat_shobon: The mix of characters who are very experienced (Bocchi, Ryo) and others who aren't in their same level on the hobby (Kita, Nijika) is good. There's something about how people who are really into music and those who are at least very slightly interested can enjoy it.
[1:48:54] demon_dandy: K-on and lucky star too
[1:49:09] Trent7004: Surprise there hasn’t been a vtuber anime
[1:49:22] Ikerislas: Idk, can't relate, genuinely some of my fav animes are nagatoro, uzaki and dress up darling so I'm just people talking about things i know nothing about ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:49:29] Returner7: YO there's one premiering soon!!  https://twitter.com/siokazunoko/status/1616014024097030145?s=21&t=Ci8rVXA_QWiZD-akdtxApA
[1:49:37] demon_dandy: back into the vtuber pit ashton51Tehe
[1:49:42] Trent7004: Oh lol
[1:49:50] Zerorush: WE STILL DONT HAVE A YOTSUBA ANIME ADAPTATION AND IT MAKES ME UPSET. Mentioning Azumanga triggered me lol
[1:50:06] beat_shobon: There's still that Kizuna Ai anime starting soon, I think?
[1:50:11] rikkaonline: azuma has said he doesnt want a yotsuba anime
[1:50:17] Returner7: that vtuber anime sounds like a LN adaptation though idk how good it'll be LOL
[1:50:23] Zerorush: Isn’t Yotsuba still going?
[1:50:23] rikkaonline: it still gets a new chapter every few months
[1:50:36] demon_dandy: I feel like theres so many stylized funny cute anime nowdays though tbh
[1:51:10] cosumik: anime these days.... artssoDed
[1:51:13] rikkaonline: it is an LN adaptation
[1:51:22] mushi_buns: wats yotsuba even about?
[1:51:26] Returner7: dude idk that's like the worst thing to happen to anime imo, crappy multi sentence long titles LOL
[1:51:35] cosumik: frfr
[1:51:38] mushi_buns: its the little greeen haired girl right?? ;o;
[1:51:38] rikkaonline: just go read it, its the best
[1:51:42] Zerorush: Whatever happened to the Hololive anime? Did the drama concerning someone who was involved with it kill it?
[1:51:47] demon_dandy: i love the op for urusei yatsura ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:51:51] Zerorush: I don’t remember the details
[1:51:56] mushi_buns: okay okay its on the list ashton51Steer
[1:52:15] demon_dandy: but it has less charm than the og since its so hyperactive
[1:52:28] T33bags: terrible ashton take
[1:52:28] Returner7: yeah that's right they had a pretty famous Mangaka working on the hololive thing... then drama ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[1:52:32] Kitkattack: I read like half of UY in middle school
[1:52:33] JTBun: @Zerorush Holo Alternative is still a thing. Think they just don't talk about it much
[1:52:35] cosumik: mumaS
[1:52:39] Zerorush: Ah
[1:52:52] cosumik: Go off queen
[1:52:58] Returner7: I thought ppl liked new Cutey Honey ?_?
[1:53:15] Returner7: lol yes
[1:53:16] kawaiicrew4ever: yea i was gonna say lol
[1:53:20] Kitkattack: I mean that's just how anime used to look, lots of close ups and reaction shots
[1:53:22] HarrisonFjord: new cutie honey was like last year?
[1:53:25] Zerorush: Just watch the live action cutie honey movie
[1:53:30] Kitkattack: simple so that they can re-use cels
[1:53:36] mushi_buns: I have been reading Goodnight Punpun, its made me cry like 3 times already
[1:53:43] kawaiicrew4ever: honeyyyy flash
[1:53:48] demon_dandy: fuufu ijou was actually pretty nice ashton51Tehe

[1:54:09] Returner7: Re: Cutie Honey 2004 YIKES, I'm old mom0kiWhy
[1:54:21] HarrisonFjord: oh I was thinking of cutie honey universe whoops
[1:54:26] american_cookie_1: No sex? Sad
[1:54:38] demon_dandy: LMAO it is stupidddd concept but they have a nice dynamic and it is INTEREATING TO LOOK AT
[1:54:50] Zerorush: Isn’t it kind of weird Crypton has never jumped on a Miku anime? Or at least like an OVA or a one off movie or something
[1:54:58] mushi_buns: @Kitkattack punpuns mom is to much like my mom its unreal, meny tears ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer

[2:01:28] Zerorush: U15 is a CG spin-off focusing on just the little kid idols
[2:01:29] mushi_buns: I was just thinking about this lmao
[2:01:36] BudderZilla: aw man, Demo emotes would be excellent for this
[2:01:41] mushi_buns: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[2:01:44] demon_dandy: i heard that show SUCKED

[2:03:07] Ikerislas: ?
[2:03:07] demon_dandy: here i stand with my ninja clan clover54Pain
[2:03:18] Returner7: hang on doesn't isn't this the plot of that old comedy movie White Ninja?
[2:03:26] mushi_buns: sounds like every anime ever
[2:03:44] Ikerislas: wich anime has had the best animation for u?
[2:04:00] Returner7: *sorry it's Beverly Hills Ninja I'm thinking of mom0kiSweats
[2:04:18] Zerorush: This just reminded me of that uhh, weird ninja girl anime from last year
[2:04:33] Returner7: lmao
[2:04:33] kawaiicrew4ever: lmaoo
[2:04:33] JTBun: lmao
[2:04:39] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:05:10] FellyVT: It reminds me of The Slayers. They sorta follow the LIght Novels, but the seasons kinda went their own way. It worked given how the show dynamic worked.
[2:05:13] Returner7: what about Trinity7 LOL!!!
[2:05:29] FellyVT: Like the content
[2:05:34] Zerorush: WAIT, doesn’t the boy smell meme come from that same weird ninja girl anime
[2:05:40] Malictory: Got back from making dinner, which anime are we on:3?
[2:05:50] FellyVT: Sorry Ash, I got on a tangent XD
[2:05:59] demon_dandy: lmaooooo fma oc ashton51Pog
[2:06:19] FellyVT: But people still liked that ending
[2:06:45] JTBun: Soul Eater's anime ending is horrible lmao
[2:06:49] demon_dandy: i didnt like the fma oc admittedly ashton51Tehe
[2:06:54] rikkaonline: vaguely
[2:06:55] demon_dandy: BRUH
[2:06:57] kawaiicrew4ever: oh god
[2:06:57] Zerorush: Original FMA was fine, but it is hard to go back to now
[2:06:58] demon_dandy: HOLY
[2:07:05] demon_dandy: KUMA MIKO
[2:07:24] mushi_buns: I always think of that fanmade visualnovel when talkin about fma
[2:07:33] Kitkattack: Soul Eater has style but I think the plot doesn't pull it's weight
[2:07:56] american_cookie_1: A talking bear?
[2:08:02] demon_dandy: it was very like weirdge ending ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[2:08:08] american_cookie_1: This sounds like Appalachia life
[2:08:38] JTBun: lmao

[2:08:52] ArdenYves: save face at all costs CoolCat

[2:09:22] Returner7: bgm?
[2:09:42] FellyVT: I'm just hoping One Piece ends with people satisfied.
[2:09:42] rikkaonline: yeah no one should ever read past vol 4 of usagi
[2:09:53] Returner7: np I'm happy w/ just your voice LOL
[2:09:58] demon_dandy: Usagi drop was extra fucked up cause the grown up portion was actually not bad until they did the incest
[2:10:05] Zerorush: Ash if your racetrack life was a slice of life show which character would you be? And who would be your three other costars? ashton51Tensai

[2:42:47] Returner7: yeah hang on, when did kakegurui suddenly pop off?!
[2:42:50] kawaiicrew4ever: saiki kuso lmao
[2:42:52] FellyVT: Some anime don't catch fire until much later.
[2:42:53] ajvark: no the shorts were compiled into episodes, and then netflix got some episodes based on the stuff that wasn't anime
[2:43:00] FellyVT: Cowboy Bebop wasn't originally popular in Japan.
[2:43:10] ajvark: that's why I double dip with the anime and manga
[2:43:28] ajvark: IU'
[2:43:47] ajvark: Remember when the kakegurui author got caught plagirizing?
[2:43:55] demon_dandy: frrrr??
[2:44:02] ajvark: "Cheat Slayer"
[2:44:19] Returner7: yeah I caught kakegurui while it was airing, and don't remember it popping of as much as it is now LOL
[2:44:25] T33bags: looks like the consensus is that ashton is somewhere between cringe and based
[2:44:28] Returner7: LMAO stalemate
[2:44:36] ajvark: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Slayer#Controversy_and_cancellation this was by the kake author; cancelled after ONE (1) chapter
[2:44:36] JTBun: let's just say you are 50% cringe
[2:44:45] demon_dandy: she is both cringe and not cringe, sasuga ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel
[2:44:49] HarrisonFjord: didn't gohands plagiarize a TON before they went under
[2:45:04] Zerorush: I think if we started talking about BL she’d go full cringe
[2:45:13] horribleham: kakegurui is eeh. Don't HATE it.
[2:45:14] SpookingInte: that 1 chapter was translated actually

[2:45:51] demon_dandy: i liked the concept behind the kakegurui characters but it never goes beyond skin deep with its ideas
[2:46:37] ajvark: i think it's still on crunchyroll
[2:46:47] american_cookie_1: Eating shit?
[2:47:03] ajvark: future diary is hype when you're watching it but when you sit down and think about it it all falls apart
[2:47:13] ajvark: code geass kinda the same way tbh

[2:49:47] FellyVT: CLAMP's artstyle is stamped on that show. That's normal.
[2:49:52] FellyVT: Yeah
[2:50:01] american_cookie_1: Something about anime

[2:52:52] T33bags: to be fair you have to have a high iq to understand chobits to most viewers the jokes will fly over their heads

[2:56:19] SpookingInte: death of the author (killed for being wrong)
[2:56:20] T33bags: @SilentShadow952 no problem

[2:58:26] Returner7: that said Engage is shaping to be a fanservice-y fire emblem like the mobile game and Fates, can't wait but I'm not expecting Three Houses again!

[2:59:10] horribleham: @Returner7 As long as it isn't like Fates lol
[2:59:12] Returner7: Three Houses was amazingly good story wise for a Fire Emblem title
[2:59:26] SilentShadow952: three houses was fun, but man i got tired of seeing the characters popping up constantly in the gacha game
[2:59:33] horribleham: yeah! I'm glad they brought back politics
[2:59:39] T33bags: higher stats means low standards dont believe her
[2:59:49] american_cookie_1: Outstanding, I have a stat of 1(one)
[2:59:53] T33bags: she probably watched a year of low tier yaoi
[2:59:57] Returner7: the oldest ones do, but post GBA era they were getting a bit generic story wise
[3:00:07] Returner7: !duel @AshtonMarten mom0kiHehe
[3:00:26] kawaiicrew4ever: the ultimate test lmao
[3:00:27] Returner7: aw crap I surrender
[3:01:05] Returner7: what even is that?
[3:01:06] ajvark: i heard bungo stray dogs was the riverdale of anime?
[3:01:17] demon_dandy: bruh i think about getting into bungo but i cant be fucked
[3:01:33] JTBun: ace attorney music??
[3:01:46] ajvark: @AshtonMarten what's the most "riverdale-core" anime you've seen? (multi seasons, writers seem to make it up as they go per episode, you can't look away)
[3:01:52] Returner7: Nier is faithful to the game, but the game does very unique things in game that can't really be replicated outside the medium
[3:02:20] ajvark: Oh wait maybe it wasn't bungo, I think it was tokyo revengers I heard was the riverdale of anime
[3:02:41] Returner7: @ajvark OG Bleach manga was 100% this
[3:02:51] demon_dandy: mayoiga sucks I love it ashton51Tehe
[3:03:13] demon_dandy: TRUE
[3:03:14] ajvark: @ajvark Kubo: "writers block. new OC dropping soon."
[3:03:22] demon_dandy: TRUE ON BOTH TAKES
[3:03:36] demon_dandy: that another op fucking slaps
[3:03:38] T33bags: ashton youre making it up as you go (literally you are a streamer and i have never watched bungo stray dogs)
[3:03:46] Returner7: yeah exactly, I think it'll be a few more episodes before it does something unique
[3:03:51] JTBun: dude the Persona 5 animation made me so sad, it just ends halfway through the fucking story
[3:03:55] demon_dandy: the og p4 anime adaptation is very funny ashton51Tehe
[3:04:17] demon_dandy: i actually really dug it
[3:04:38] ajvark: i dont remember it that way
[3:04:44] metaconstruct: ya LOL
[3:04:45] demon_dandy: the p3 anime movies are actually pretty pog imo
[3:04:48] ajvark: but idk, tumblr might be like that
[3:05:18] T33bags: discarded opinion (never played or watched danganropa)

[3:06:02] kawaiicrew4ever: nagito komaeda's a silly guy
[3:06:07] ajvark: you should play Killer7 or No More Heroes if you like Danganronpa; Kokada spent his whole career trying to be Suda51
[3:06:08] SpookingInte: Nagito is always first.....
[3:06:10] Returner7: maybe Danganropa had an amazing anime dub? a lot of my dub only friends say a lot of good things about the p4 dub

[3:06:51] Returner7: ah Killer7 my name sake!!!! ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[3:06:52] demon_dandy: well the p4 anime was SoL focused so it lent well to the comedy
[3:06:53] ajvark: and that's no more heroes
[3:06:54] kawaiicrew4ever: uhhhh

[3:08:40] Ikerislas: The "Iker" in my name is because that's my name
[3:08:57] T33bags: they call it tea bagging because you are tea bagging someone
[3:09:06] demon_dandy: tomo chan anime seems to be okay
[3:09:14] ajvark: what's the point of anime now if we're not gonna get Dorohedoro season 2 or a faithful adaptation of Akira?
[3:09:24] ajvark: besides CSM I guess
[3:09:24] demon_dandy: i do respect sally voicing both sub and dub carol ashton51Pog

[3:10:12] demon_dandy: carol might make me watch more tomo
[3:10:13] ShimadaTiger: 3rd is the last
[3:10:15] SpookingInte: no the manga is over
[3:10:21] demon_dandy: nah 3rd is final ashton51Tehe
[3:10:26] ajvark: trying to convince the girl I'm dating to watch Mob by showing her the TROVE of Saiki and Mob crossover fanart
[3:10:36] ajvark: perhaps once I finish Saiki I will have leverage
[3:10:39] ShimadaTiger: I followed tomo chan since the first few chapters shimaCry so happy it got animated
[3:11:09] ShimadaTiger: Yeah it's just good, but I like it for what it is
[3:11:20] kawaiicrew4ever: kaguya adaptation went so hard
[3:11:34] Ikerislas: What happens when someone redeems the "vroom vroom"?
[3:11:40] metaconstruct: try it out
[3:11:44] kawaiicrew4ever: last romcom that went beyond expectations was dress up darling
[3:11:53] T33bags: i like when the romcom is more com than rom but the rom is still strong
[3:11:54] barfchan: ashton51Spin

[3:12:29] kawaiicrew4ever: yea i hate how ppl get pressed over the fanservice
[3:12:33] Ikerislas: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[3:12:35] TheAsterite: subtle? haha
[3:12:37] kawaiicrew4ever: distracts from how damn well they adapted it
[3:12:42] metaconstruct: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe

[3:13:10] JTBun: people stoopid
[3:13:15] kawaiicrew4ever: @demon_dandy frfr
[3:14:03] Ikerislas: I think 30% of the stream so far has not been about anime
[3:14:11] demon_dandy: I read kaguya from early on and i remember marketing it to my nonromcom friends as like " this is like a psychological romcom where they are TWISTED ashton51Tensai "
[3:14:16] kawaiicrew4ever: trueing
[3:14:23] kawaiicrew4ever: @demon_dandy lmfao
[3:14:26] american_cookie_1: @ikerislas it’s closer to 45%
[3:14:29] JTBun: it's much better than something like Fire Force where the fan service did NOTHING for the show at all and made it worse
[3:14:51] demon_dandy: fire force fan service was so weird
[3:15:00] horribleham: I was reading the manga for dress up darling and what I really loved is how respectful it was of people's hobbies and interests.
[3:15:02] kawaiicrew4ever: yea it put me off
[3:15:08] ajvark: have you ever watched anything of Lupin III?
[3:15:12] SpookingInte: the fan service rant in the manga was peak copiun by the author
[3:15:17] demon_dandy: I actually kinda like fire force but its so misfit
[3:15:23] T33bags: i think the weird part comes from dudes salivating over a 16 year old character but thats the weird guys problem at that point
[3:15:35] american_cookie_1: ashton51Love <—cute chinchilla
[3:15:38] demon_dandy: bruhhhhhh yeah clover54Pain
[3:15:49] JTBun: @demon_dandy I like Fire Force also, it's just kinda weird at times and could be so much better It has such a cool concept
[3:16:06] T33bags: oh yeah dress up darling last episode was so insane compared to the same scene in the manga
[3:16:08] horribleham: yeah, there was some weird stuff in the manga. Author put in a lecture from a character that was clearly just the author speaking.
[3:16:26] kawaiicrew4ever: the erection animation went CRAZY
[3:16:32] demon_dandy: @jtbman theres a lot of raw bits in fire force but also a lot of whack parts ashton51Tehe but thats part of its pull to me (hard to defend tho)
[3:16:44] ajvark: @AshtonMarten have you ever watched anything of Lupin III? I feel like you could become obsessed with the whole cast in general
[3:16:46] JTBun: yeah
