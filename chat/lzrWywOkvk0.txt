[1:00:05] a_o_h11: Like you opened Pandora's box
[1:00:08] ThrowRacket: oh I have a guy who does that on discord to me
[1:00:21] a_o_h11: Like you just was expecting a basic hello and you got a college thesis
[1:00:23] EbiBoon: Miss Ashton, one of the chillas frew up gweh
[1:00:26] DavidPortnov: I just ghost and/or block in that case.
[1:00:29] timinator193: You don't want to start a conversation you don't want to commit to
[1:00:29] Envivii: boundaries are important
[1:00:39] Octolirious: Ah, when a onetime chat unexpectedly becomes more talking than you thought
[1:00:57] outrunthewind: If you message someone from ages ago, they may get the wrong idea about it, plus they'll want to catch up on the last however long
[1:00:58] Pudddd: i get that lol
[1:01:03] a_o_h11: Like the conversation goes: Sup and you get Hello.rkrkrkrrjekrrirfjtnekerjrjrkrkrkrrk, for the next 2 Weeks
[1:01:08] timinator193: Don't hurt peoples feelings thats all ashton51Love ashton51Love

[1:01:16] a_o_h11: Conversation avoidant?
[1:01:18] ticklemeastolfo: i feel similarly
[1:01:30] DavidPortnov: I'm always the one who reaches out.
[1:01:40] a_o_h11: If you want answer: do you get anxiety from speaking?
[1:01:50] a_o_h11: TOO MANY THINGS IN SPEED RATS BRAIN
[1:01:53] outrunthewind: I haven't talked to high school people in like 20+ years, I'm not sure I can face opening that door
[1:02:00] Senoquese: i get it i dmd happy birthday to what i assumed was a chill ex and i immediately regretted it since she started dming me every day like " Flirt heyyy Flirt you free " way
[1:02:19] demon_dandy: Fuuuuuck seno ICANT
[1:02:20] Kitkattack: wiiiiild
[1:02:20] a_o_h11: It is: slowly but it is
[1:02:31] eb0ss1: at least you arent being fake
[1:02:31] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[1:02:43] a_o_h11: Like you were hoping they'd respond back with the same energy
[1:03:12] Senoquese: LOLL yeahh
[1:03:13] a_o_h11: Hi you respond with the energy or a 3 or 4 and they give back a 9 or 10 in intensity
[1:03:17] timinator193: It's so you don't disappoint someone that you can't continue to talk to
[1:03:25] outrunthewind: Your social style seems similar to mine lol
[1:03:26] InsaneLoke: i think that's just normal
[1:03:41] timinator193: or want to, to be fair
[1:03:50] EbiBoon: We need PTFs, Platonic Texting Friends, where you just send memes to each other
[1:03:51] timinator193: That's totally normal
[1:03:52] Envivii: lol
[1:03:53] Senoquese: LOL
[1:03:54] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:03:55] murderdeathki1l: lol
[1:04:02] ticklemeastolfo: i never NEVER initiate
[1:04:12] demon_dandy: in different area codes Classic like luda said
[1:04:24] outrunthewind: That's what the Ashton Marten discord is for
[1:04:34] Envivii: i think it's best to be direct and set boundaries of how comfortable I am of communicating with someone
[1:04:35] InsaneLoke: you are a bit cold but that's part of your appeal
[1:04:39] murderdeathki1l: i initiate a lot but people are afraid to approach me for some reason
[1:04:40] ticklemeastolfo: i'm a little exaggerational there there are people i definitely feel comfortable with a handful of people
[1:04:50] ticklemeastolfo: just firing off a dm or whatever
[1:04:55] ticklemeastolfo: but for most people, naw
[1:05:01] murderdeathki1l: maybe because im 6'4
[1:05:09] timinator193: That's what I was doing just spamming the discord thanksgiving day lol
[1:05:30] Jasuchin: No room to plug in anything else to the social battery
[1:05:36] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:05:51] Kitkattack: that's nasty work right there @Blaisevtch
[1:05:54] DavidPortnov: I absolutely get that. I can't talk to even my closest friends for more than a couple of hours.
[1:06:04] outrunthewind: Honestly one of the things I have the hardest time understanding is how exactly truly social people actually manage to socialize as much as they do
[1:06:05] murderdeathki1l: wdym?
[1:06:07] InsaneLoke: girl dont discount yourself
[1:06:19] eb0ss1: im p desperate, thats why im here! /j
[1:06:31] demon_dandy: Its different with text and discord tbf
[1:06:35] InsaneLoke: if people go to you, its not cus they are desperate, its cus they like you
[1:06:42] eb0ss1: yep!
[1:06:44] murderdeathki1l: yes
[1:06:47] timinator193: I think desperate is the wrong word, regarding BOTH parties
[1:06:47] Jasuchin: A few yeah
[1:06:52] Senoquese: yeahh
[1:06:54] ArthurWar: Yeah, a couple of times
[1:07:04] murderdeathki1l: i just break their heart a little
[1:07:05] Kitkattack: not in a while, but yeah
[1:07:09] demon_dandy: Shes talking about ME ashton51Nightmare
[1:07:12] ThrowRacket: just like me fr
[1:07:16] DavidPortnov: Yes. Absolutely. It's not even that you don't like them. It's just that it doesn't work.
[1:07:17] murderdeathki1l: social grace is a waste of time
[1:07:29] InsaneLoke: @demon_dandy sorry ur finding out this way ashton51Despair
[1:07:35] Senoquese: she is a yaoi (freaky) girl and im a yaoi (wholesome) boy 😔 not meant to be
[1:07:42] murderdeathki1l: i dont feel bad if they cant take a hint
[1:07:48] timinator193: Don't be a fake friend Ashton
[1:07:59] ArthurWar: Sometimes there's just zero chemistry and that's how it goes
[1:08:08] Kitkattack: I feel like being straight forward and honest prevents a lot of this awkward back and forth
[1:08:11] Senoquese: i dont think its being a fake friend unless you promise to be more than the energy you give
[1:08:22] murderdeathki1l: sometimes people just want to use you
[1:08:24] ahzree: lmaoo LADDIIIIIES
[1:08:25] DavidPortnov: @senoquese Exactly!
[1:08:29] brucewagneto: LMAOO
[1:08:35] demon_dandy: @insaneloke ashton51Despair when you become the next chat topic
[1:08:37] timinator193: If people are healthy, they can recognize that
[1:08:49] InsaneLoke: i think friends is just as serious as dating
[1:09:11] buruhas: No way a tier below friendzoned ashton51Pathetic
[1:09:21] DavidPortnov: @insaneloke Actually yeah.
[1:09:21] JTBun: idk how to talk to people
[1:09:23] Senoquese: i find it extremely hard to turn away people id rather just give that little energy
[1:09:32] demon_dandy: I just feel different about it on text form
[1:09:34] timinator193: @buruhas it's called being a chatter lol
[1:09:34] The_Great_Moof: i had to end some long-ish time friendships this year cuz some dudes got kinda weird

[1:11:30] DavidPortnov: Definitely not.
[1:11:40] Senoquese: its definitely not out of people not liking you tho
[1:11:42] timinator193: I think we're getting alot of that this generation
[1:11:43] aureliangates: naur thats totally fine, i have like one single best friend and hes my roommate !
[1:11:54] Kitkattack: best friend is like a childish thing where you have to single someone out
[1:11:57] DavidPortnov: I can count the amount of friends I have on one hand.
[1:11:59] The_Great_Moof: my bff is in long-term rehab. it's been a bit lonely, we like to talk for hours about movies & stuff.
[1:12:05] dashofdakka: I didn't make a lot of close friends until my mid-20s. You never know. ashton51Smile
[1:12:11] murderdeathki1l: that sucks
[1:12:22] Senoquese: LOL
[1:12:24] murderdeathki1l: LOLL

[1:12:40] ticklemeastolfo: woah woah woah
[1:12:41] aureliangates: ashton51Dumpy
[1:12:44] ticklemeastolfo: sorry i'm a best friend whore
[1:12:48] Senoquese: you have so many of vtuber friends constantly spewing love for you on their streams, im sure its not about no one liking you
[1:12:48] Kitkattack: All of my friends are best friends.
[1:12:49] The_Great_Moof: kind lol
[1:12:56] The_Great_Moof: i did lose like 50lbs this year tho, so that's nice
[1:12:57] InsaneLoke: dont laugh!
[1:13:00] murderdeathki1l: thats what a whore would say
[1:13:02] ticklemeastolfo: (i have one basically but a small group of three that kinda stay in that categorization)
[1:13:03] aureliangates: if everyones a best friend no one is....
[1:13:07] Senoquese: LOL
[1:13:09] Kitkattack: om
[1:13:16] demon_dandy: Best friend is weird cause i got friends i socialise with more regularly but my best friend is a childhood friend and we mostly just meet up when we can
[1:13:19] pythontech: All my friends are heathens
[1:13:28] Envivii: i used to think all my friends were my best friends but i def don't now
[1:13:48] DavidPortnov: I hate ranking people. It's why I don't like oshi/kamioshi discourse.
[1:13:50] Kitkattack: the more you think about the hierarchy of you pals it kind of breaks down idk
[1:14:12] Senoquese: that office bit where michael says he wants 1000 children so he can have 1000 best friends that cant leave him
[1:14:25] timinator193: Well make room for them if you can or want to, you know best
[1:14:26] ticklemeastolfo: i like when you can just be close friends or homies but don't have to like...manage their emotions all the time
[1:14:31] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:14:36] ticklemeastolfo: i'm good to support someone but we don't always have the time or energy
[1:14:45] DavidPortnov: Same actually. The friend I consider my "best friend" is one I don't talk to much. But when we hang out, it's like there was never any distance.
[1:14:46] aureliangates: LOOOL
[1:14:51] InsaneLoke: you ARE evil
[1:15:00] Kitkattack: oh no, she used personality A with friend group B ashton51Nightmare
[1:15:11] buruhas: a little co-op stimming time
[1:15:34] DavidPortnov: All of my friends except for one are ones I've known since elementary school.
[1:15:35] Senoquese: yeah it doesnt have to be a bad thing ashton51Love
[1:15:36] murderdeathki1l: its very noraml
[1:15:37] timinator193: That's something special you have to be lucky to have
[1:15:37] murderdeathki1l: normal
[1:15:45] murderdeathki1l: exactly tim
[1:15:47] Kitkattack: online people don't have friends ash
[1:15:48] InsaneLoke: "im glad you people arent complete loners"
[1:16:00] timinator193: It's a touchy subject
[1:16:00] murderdeathki1l: a lot of people cant handle people who actually can mask off
[1:16:08] InsaneLoke: you are kinda lone wolf, you are very independent
[1:16:10] eb0ss1: awww i'll be your bestie ash
[1:16:21] DavidPortnov: Checks out.
[1:16:25] aureliangates: well you dont really have to dedicate all your time to them, when i moved in here my roomie and i like barely talked to each other cause we've been friends for so long it was SO NICE we're both autistic so we just dont have to interact most of the time
[1:16:33] timinator193: Well we hope you find one ashton51Love
[1:16:34] demon_dandy: Do you have a best friend too" ashton51Woo ts
[1:16:54] demon_dandy: Like the toybox song

[1:17:16] JTBun: idk who

[1:17:32] Kitkattack: poor ytb bro got really burned ashton51Kneel
[1:17:32] InsaneLoke: i think ur good lone wolf, you got 10,000 people to trauma dump to
[1:17:43] Romblymo: We had the question in jackbox recently and I don't really think I have best friends, I got ride or dies and homies essentially
[1:17:43] timinator193: You don't have to but its always nice to feel that way
[1:17:45] murderdeathki1l: so true
[1:17:46] buruhas: I imagine your theoretical best friend would want similar boundaries to the ones you want, it'd be a good idea
[1:17:48] Senoquese: you can have friends any way you want as long as theyre your friends, whether theyre the "best" or not, as long as theyre there for you
[1:17:51] JTBun: not odd
[1:17:55] murderdeathki1l: if you cant connect whats even the point
[1:17:56] mareeples: Agreed, I don't think there's one prescribed path.
[1:18:00] demon_dandy: All my friends in my puter ashton51Squish
[1:18:01] The_Great_Moof: vtuber fancords are pretty chill & full of nice ppl imo. a lil weird, but u can usually find someone who matches your weirdness.
[1:18:03] outrunthewind: Some people definitely take advantage of people they call "friends." I have a bit of a similar situation too. I need to find a time to bring it up
[1:18:05] Senoquese: shout out to my bestie for constantly listening to my 24/7 ashton talk even if hes absolutely not into vtubers
[1:18:10] Romblymo: I don't think I could point at the lads and rank them
[1:18:17] spikebomb5: Hi ashton, how was ur Thanksgiving? kloeBite

[1:18:46] timinator193: @Romblymo very nice ashton51Nodders
[1:18:47] InsaneLoke: all my friends are my best friends cus we gotta fit into a comp team
[1:18:54] Kitkattack: the lads are all equal at the round table
[1:19:14] outrunthewind: I do like online friends, but I want to find some friends that want to go on hikes with me. I do hope they'd also share my nerdy interests so we can talk about stuff though
[1:19:15] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552

[3:33:31] aureliangates: hiii
[3:33:38] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Everyone really wanted to do water effects this era of games
[3:33:45] timinator193: You did
[3:33:46] Ornifexis: but why is it important for people to use the fujoshi tag?
[3:33:51] bonatide: I was just about to call you out as balloon boy
[3:34:02] demon_dandy: Oh trueeeee
[3:34:12] SoundBorg_wav: It's soon pretty though
[3:34:18] TheAsterite: Modern computers cant comprehend GameCube water
[3:34:44] SoundBorg_wav: Yeah, young me was definitely raging during parts of this game LUL
[3:35:02] Red__2: we just dont know how to do it anympre
[3:35:02] Envivii: there are some impressive effects on the dreamcast that modern emulators don't do well
[3:35:08] GManx0: Gaming lacks soul
[3:35:09] Romblymo: I mean we can do 2d animation like before, you just gotta build a big camera rig for it
[3:35:09] redactedenheim: well back in the day they used paint on cell
[3:35:10] The_Great_Moof: we also lost the tools to make movies in proper black & while
[3:35:10] Qrockpot: is it lost art??
[3:35:14] demon_dandy: They cant do fake fog as good anymore
[3:35:18] Senoquese: thats actually true this sunshine water was written in a REALLY specific way and i needed to enable some specific features to get it looking accurate
[3:35:29] chewyrock_en: the fog effects for Persona 4 Golden is not the same because of the PS2 specific hardware iirc
[3:35:35] demon_dandy: No in games ashton51Tehe
[3:35:44] Ornifexis: my father is a game dev, I showed him Sunshine water and asked him what it would take to make it today, he said "we can't .... we don't know how anymore"
[3:36:00] whatsinsidethebarrel: Optimization, truly a lost art
[3:36:09] SoundBorg_wav: You should see how they did the static effects in Metroid Prime. It's not a texture, because a static texture would be way too big, so they're literally showing you the games code instead musicmommyZoom musicmommyZoom
[3:36:09] timinator193: Fog has been looking pretty wonky this last update ashton51Omegalul
[3:36:16] TheAsterite: @Ornifexis beuchiLaugh
[3:36:31] GManx0: Seems pretty stylized to me
[3:36:32] Senoquese: the sunshine water depends on the distance at which the game can render objects, and since modern emulators can have way larger resolution and textures, dolphin needs a patch to specifically change the way water renders
[3:36:34] SoundBorg_wav: This is probably my favourite game water
[3:36:44] Senoquese: so it is actually complicated
[3:36:56] bonatide: She got a glimpse of what its like watching her
[3:37:01] Envivii: what's ur favorite movie? mine is... da movie!
[3:37:02] The_Great_Moof: honestly a lot of old games really hold up well. makes modern graphics feel kind of a waste sometimes.
[3:37:12] applecadough: Do u stream on xmas day
