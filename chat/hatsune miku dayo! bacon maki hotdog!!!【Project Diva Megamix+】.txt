[3:04:34] RheaAitken: i can see that ye
[3:04:37] SigilSnoot: I think that's accurate.
[3:04:40] Xerpocalypse: Super cool that the hardware literally contains the PSP main CPU as a co-processor so it can emulate PSP games perfectly

[3:08:16] Xerpocalypse: megamix models are the 2d shadered ones I think
[3:08:17] erodozer: you can change the shaders in megamix to dreamy threatre shaders in the menu
[3:08:35] Xerpocalypse: nope, they're just shadered
[3:08:42] Xerpocalypse: they proved that on Switch
[3:08:53] ArdenYves: nerdge
[3:09:00] Xerpocalypse: oh yeah; models are the same between FT and Megamix
[3:09:16] Xerpocalypse: someone modded a Switch to use the non-shadered version
[3:09:50] BlakeTheNerd: The expo 2021 ones were good, but the Sega made ones are still GOAT
[3:10:02] Xerpocalypse: i wish I could set O to confirm on this version
[3:10:07] demon_dandy: OHHHH CLASSIC
[3:10:08] erodozer: LETS GOOO
[3:10:13] beat_shobon: CLASSIC
[3:10:23] Xerpocalypse: I like the older Miku Expo ones, but the live AR for the 2021 expo models is really cool
[3:10:23] BlakeTheNerd: Really hope the expos go back to irl concerts cuz I miss those Sega models irl rawber2PANIK
[3:10:27] demon_dandy: WHAT THE HELL I DIDNT KNOW

[3:11:54] Xerpocalypse: @erodozer ironic that performance got better on Switch when they used the non-shadered versions
[3:12:17] Xerpocalypse: you can change that
[3:12:22] beat_shobon: So true, I need to release that original from the set ahaha.. soon.
[3:12:25] Xerpocalypse: it's in the sound options i think(?)
[3:13:04] BlakeTheNerd: You can actually change the vocals in the settings. So you can still hear them sing on missed notes if you wanted to
[3:13:08] wraithhawit: LUL then I'd be really disappointed in the attention span of the second person
[3:13:10] ArdenYves: ratatouille but rhythm game

[3:15:06] BlakeTheNerd: You mean the intro?
[3:15:08] Xerpocalypse: I think that specific PV is prerendered
[3:15:10] beat_shobon: vocaloid making people teary eyed is one of my favorite feelings
[3:15:14] Xerpocalypse: the intro vid one
[3:15:23] beat_shobon: its such a goal to achieve for a producer and video makers i believe

[3:21:36] beat_shobon: tuning definitely stands out from producer to producer and its really cool
[3:21:52] erodozer: this is making me want to break out my ddr pad and start exercising to vocaloid again, I love these tunes so much
[3:21:59] beat_shobon: now that you mention niconico i find it so wild that i found her in 2008 and i thought it was like an AI or something... didn't know I'd be so into Miku years later ahaha
[3:22:22] Xerpocalypse: I've thought about getting one of the 3rd party arcade-esque controllers for this game
[3:22:32] Xerpocalypse: they're really expensive and loud though
[3:22:36] beat_shobon: the latest games have a whole tab of vocaloid music
