[0:34:43] F1nalStarman: They are still at it. I saw NSP in concert last year.
[0:34:46] Navy_Mongoose: Richter
[0:34:48] pogotross: oh she doesn't know
[0:34:52] EmkaZRC: Richter my boy
[0:34:56] Navy_Mongoose: because they were huge on NES and SNES
[0:35:03] Navy_Mongoose: Yes (no)

[0:35:41] Romblymo: its Konami
[0:35:41] DavidPortnov: It was Konami.
[0:35:43] ArthurWar: It was Konami that made it
[0:35:43] Seere_CH: No
[0:35:44] PSYCOMMUnist: It's made by Konami.
[0:35:46] JaAmfan: bruh
[0:35:46] F1nalStarman: Konami
[0:35:47] EmkaZRC: No by Konami
[0:35:48] Navy_Mongoose: made by Konami, but mainly on Nintendos
[0:35:53] PSYCOMMUnist: But the vast majority is on Nintendo consoles.
[0:35:58] fatcacha: grrr konami
[0:36:00] GManx0: Castlevania is Nintendo the same way MGS is PLaystation
[0:36:01] pogotross: Yeah the pachinko company peepoSad
[0:36:09] Navy_Mongoose: Richter the best
[0:36:15] yojamjam: psycho mantis calls it out if you have a sotn save file

[0:37:12] Navy_Mongoose: who is like Simon's Great Great Grandfather
[0:37:12] ReyJaggy: I think for yoshitaka amano you are thinkig of vampire hunter D, he did art for the novels
[0:37:13] DavidPortnov: I've only seen the first season of the show so far.
[0:37:14] EmkaZRC: Trevor is the first anime. But Richter is in the second anime
[0:37:15] redactedenheim: magical trevor belmont?
[0:37:17] JaAmfan: there is no castlevania anime wwparaBoohoohoooo
[0:37:21] JTBun: the show is amazing
[0:37:29] GManx0: Waren Ellis is something else sometimes. Both good and bad
[0:37:35] Seere_CH: alucard
[0:37:36] ArthurWar: Alucard
[0:37:37] fatcacha: i stopped at s2
[0:37:38] Navy_Mongoose: that's Alucard
[0:37:40] EmkaZRC: Alucrad
[0:37:41] DavidPortnov: It has a certain vibe to it that I wasn't initially open to, but may be able to appreciate now.
[0:37:42] Navy_Mongoose: Dracula backwards
[0:37:42] Senoquese: ar ar ar OhMyDog
[0:37:46] EmkaZRC: Alucard*
[0:37:47] yojamjam: ARCULAD
[0:37:50] Navy_Mongoose: he's also in CV 3
[0:37:50] GManx0: Herculad
[0:37:52] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[0:37:53] fatcacha: hahahahaha
[0:37:54] Romblymo: reverse dracula
[0:38:01] Zerunus: alucard is from symphony of the night
[0:38:08] JTBun: kinda
[0:38:10] timinator193: ...
[0:38:19] hideki_iii: A LA Carte?
[0:38:25] JaAmfan: I've found that your enjoyment of the animated series is inversely correlated to your enjoyment of the actual games
[0:38:30] Romblymo: Do you mean Richtor from Nocturne
[0:38:41] buruhas: Trevor is like... Simon's granddad?
[0:38:46] Senoquese: LOL
[0:38:50] pogotross: when you play SOTN maybe :)
[0:38:52] yojamjam: the show picks up
[0:38:53] GManx0: I hear Season 1 was rough
[0:38:54] JTBun: the first season is not the best, but its also a short pilot, the season after are amazing
[0:38:55] fatcacha: it can be a chore to watch but can be rewarding
[0:38:56] Rex_Ivan9: The original Castlevania show is great for the first two seasons, absolutely
[0:39:02] fatcacha: s2 was great
[0:39:04] Navy_Mongoose: 1st season is the best though
[0:39:05] Navy_Mongoose: wtf
[0:39:06] Seere_CH: i liked s2 a Lot
[0:39:10] PSYCOMMUnist: Symphony of the Night is the best of your life type game imo.. It's a true masterpiece. OoT level.
[0:39:12] DavidPortnov: It's got a certain vibe. Supposed to be kind of a sendup of old OVAs.
[0:39:13] JTBun: the first season is so short
[0:39:18] JaAmfan: just watch vampire hunter D
[0:39:22] yojamjam: you got through most of the slog
[0:39:24] JTBun: first season is like 5 eps
[0:39:25] timinator193: im so sorry, there is no yaoi ashton
[0:39:27] Romblymo: it was made knowing there would be more seasons so the 1st one really is a world build sorta thing
[0:39:30] EmkaZRC: 1st season is just 4 episodes I think?
[0:39:37] DavidPortnov: @EmkaZRC Yeah.
[0:39:42] fatcacha: there is yaoi…
[0:39:44] JTBun: season 2 onward is amazing tho
[0:39:57] Rex_Ivan9: Season 2 is definitely worth it
[0:39:58] redactedenheim: "implied yaoi"
[0:40:02] pogotross: "yaoi" is the plural of "male character"
[0:40:02] fatcacha: there is yuri too
[0:40:10] JaAmfan: bravern save us please save us bravern
[0:40:16] GManx0: Yaoi Slopper
[0:40:17] Seere_CH: Yes there is theyre doing nefarious things to alucard on my tl
[0:40:21] EmkaZRC: When there is canon yaoi you lose interest lol
[0:40:23] Senoquese: dont you have a dog bed
[0:40:47] fatcacha: tag tier list
[0:40:52] redactedenheim: so she has all the doujins
[0:41:03] GManx0: She HATES Main Couples so much
[0:41:13] pogotross: Dracula x The Whip
[0:41:16] ticklemeastolfo: castlevania 3
[0:41:17] PSYCOMMUnist: SoTN
[0:41:18] GManx0: PS1
[0:41:18] Navy_Mongoose: in 3
[0:41:19] DavidPortnov: Symphony of the Night
[0:41:19] ticklemeastolfo: and sotn
[0:41:20] fatcacha: 3
[0:41:23] pogotross: 3 but no one plays that
[0:41:25] redactedenheim: Al The Crad
[0:41:27] GolfTermBirdie: ashton! <3
[0:41:27] ticklemeastolfo: sotn as the main main character
[0:41:30] Seere_CH: symphony is alucards game but castlevania 3 is his first appearance
[0:41:32] yojamjam: it's okay we're skipping 2
[0:41:37] DavidPortnov: Everyone loves Alucard.
[0:41:41] buruhas: Arculad is Alucard's little companion in Symphony of the Night
[0:41:43] Navy_Mongoose: you should play SotN as your next big one if you want a full Alucard experience
[0:41:46] ticklemeastolfo: dhampir
[0:41:48] GManx0: And?
[0:41:50] pogotross: yeah he's a like an anti hero
[0:41:51] GolfTermBirdie: wonder why he's doing that
[0:41:51] fatcacha: sotn is soooo good its timeless
[0:41:52] Calmo_Ho: Calmo_Ho subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! HELLO ASHTON MARTEN!!!
[0:41:52] ticklemeastolfo: sotn explains his deal
[0:42:04] Romblymo: she's vampire racist
[0:42:05] EmkaZRC: Alucard first appears in Castlevania 3 but he looks nothing like he does in Symphony of the Night which is is iconic look
[0:42:08] timinator193: why is it vam PIRE ashton? ashton51Thinky
[0:42:13] ticklemeastolfo: why indeed
[0:42:14] pogotross: 2 is dogshit
[0:42:14] Zerunus: I think the best games in the series are symphony of the night and aria of sorrow
[0:42:16] GolfTermBirdie: its just not a very good game
[0:42:17] ticklemeastolfo: ashton51Smile
[0:42:19] DavidPortnov: 2 is tough.=
[0:42:20] Navy_Mongoose: because 2 is like SotN if it sucked
[0:42:22] GolfTermBirdie: AVGN made a video about it
[0:42:25] PSYCOMMUnist: 2 is like Zelda 2 it's not a real Castlevania game
[0:42:29] Seere_CH: i liked 2 a lot
[0:42:29] GolfTermBirdie: if its in the AVGN library then its not good
[0:42:30] DavidPortnov: People do like 2.
[0:42:38] ticklemeastolfo: yeah 2 is very interesting because you can see the dna of what it turned into with SotN and the later games
[0:42:38] GManx0: She should try it anyway
[0:42:40] Fallen92x: There's a patch for 2 that makes it better I hear
[0:42:40] pogotross: you have to download fan translations and even then it's bad om
[0:42:45] fatcacha: 2 is like xenosaga 2 it sucks
[0:42:45] timinator193: LMAO
[0:42:45] ticklemeastolfo: but it's not executed super great
[0:42:46] Senoquese: LOLLLL
[0:42:47] res_ipsa_: I love 2 personally, but probably use a walkthrough
[0:42:47] Romblymo: 2 is like really not good, lotta cryptic shit
[0:42:50] timinator193: SAME THOUGHT LMAO
[0:42:50] chewyrock_en: 2 2
[0:42:53] GolfTermBirdie: people like mario sunshine too
[0:42:56] EmkaZRC: There were a lot of weird 2 in the NES
[0:43:00] JaAmfan: classic action platformer
[0:43:01] JTBun: yes
[0:43:07] pogotross: Ashton have you never watched Angry Video Game Nerd
[0:43:13] JTBun: yes
[0:43:18] yojamjam: 3 is like 1
[0:43:19] Seere_CH: castlevania 2 is good when you dont got ppl in your ear saying it sucks
[0:43:20] Zerunus: this one feels more like an arcade platformer I think?
[0:43:20] JTBun: no
[0:43:21] JaAmfan: item based progression
[0:43:21] Navy_Mongoose: 3 is platformer again
[0:43:23] GManx0: Backtracking
[0:43:24] chewyrock_en: backtracking
[0:43:25] yojamjam: sotn is the first metroidlike
[0:43:25] GolfTermBirdie: well its a very bad RPG + platformer
[0:43:30] Romblymo: its a vania, but not a metroidvania
[0:43:33] GolfTermBirdie: this is a vania
[0:43:36] pogotross: 2 is kind of a metroidvania
[0:43:38] Senoquese: ashton51Nodders
[0:43:39] res_ipsa_: Metroidvania didn't start until SotN
[0:43:40] ticklemeastolfo: in castlevania 1 no
[0:43:40] DavidPortnov: Yes.
[0:43:40] GolfTermBirdie: you actually do backtrack in 2
[0:43:43] GolfTermBirdie: but not in 1
[0:43:44] redactedenheim: A Veinia is smaller than an Arteria
[0:43:46] timinator193: That's a staple for metroidvana
[0:43:47] EmkaZRC: No Vania starts with Symphony
[0:43:47] ticklemeastolfo: it's more arcade game sorta level split
[0:43:47] StreamElements: Donated $50 or more to my recent Winter Break Donothon? You get a reward! Send your info to me using this form to receive it: https://forms.gle/R34K5BNtcyVtGyQEA
[0:43:59] pogotross: Super Metroid and SotN dropped around the same time so they call the genre Metroidvania
[0:43:59] ticklemeastolfo: full linear line of progress
[0:44:01] Octolirious: I thought Venia games key feature is backtracking?
[0:44:03] timinator193: yea
[0:44:03] DavidPortnov: I'm not much of a search-action person myself.
[0:44:05] Fallen92x: No, it is a vania it'
[0:44:07] EmkaZRC: It's like Metroid
[0:44:09] Zerunus: sotn and aria of sorrow are really good vanias
[0:44:11] Romblymo: It means the map opens up as you get powerups
[0:44:12] Fallen92x: it isn't a metroid
[0:44:12] ticklemeastolfo: it's not
[0:44:14] ArthurWar: It's not like Tooie backtracking
[0:44:15] JTBun: its not
[0:44:16] Navy_Mongoose: 2 is the first Metroidvania and its bad
[0:44:16] DavidPortnov: You're not wrong.
[0:44:20] ticklemeastolfo: progress is typically very linear
[0:44:22] chewyrock_en: you get to branch off and find optional upgrades
[0:44:23] pogotross: it was awesome back when we only had linear games
[0:44:23] Superfroakie82: its like fun backtracking
[0:44:24] Seere_CH: its fun trust
[0:44:24] timinator193: Evidently its done well
[0:44:26] JTBun: if done right its fun
[0:44:26] ticklemeastolfo: and the maps aren't huge
[0:44:27] GolfTermBirdie: well its more of  the idea of "exploring" the entire world map for you to move as you like, but also forcing you to go back to places to unlock new areas
[0:44:28] DavidPortnov: But people do like them.
[0:44:32] Romblymo: like you go back and you have a different power so now you do thing
[0:44:32] Navy_Mongoose: basically Metroidvania just means its like Metroid
[0:44:35] yojamjam: it's like a zelda where you revisit locales with new abilities
[0:44:40] F1nalStarman: It's not. It makes the world feel lived in and allows it to "evolve" over the course of the game. Backtracking when done well is good.
[0:44:44] Navy_Mongoose: and DARK SOULS
[0:44:52] PSYCOMMUnist: In 2 you move like .00001 miles an hour and the combat sucks and it's IMPOSSIBLE without a guide
[0:44:55] Fallen92x: you never played a metroid?
[0:44:57] ArthurWar: It's backtracking that is more centered around you getting new stuff and tools to let you advance even further in those areas
[0:44:59] pogotross: Zelda 2 is a metroidvania
[0:45:05] chewyrock_en: hollow knight is a really good metroidvania
[0:45:19] ticklemeastolfo: kind of in a really weird way if you get a little crazy with it
[0:45:21] JaAmfan: ori?
[0:45:21] Navy_Mongoose: you're played Dark Souls games, which are Metroidvanias imo
[0:45:22] Romblymo: she only knows metroid from the starbomb song
[0:45:24] timinator193: Kirby
[0:45:25] GolfTermBirdie: finnish...
[0:45:26] MelvinSoupreme: my summer car
[0:45:28] F1nalStarman: Dark Souls games are essentially 3D Metroidvanias
[0:45:28] chewyrock_en: Ori?
[0:45:31] Zerunus: with metroid games I highly reccomend super metroid and metroid fusion
[0:45:37] PSYCOMMUnist: Hollow Knight is a masterpiece. You will get SO invested in the characters and shipping in it Ashton.
[0:45:40] Navy_Mongoose: Rabi Ribi?
[0:45:42] olandgren: Gris?
[0:45:53] Superfroakie82: u should play super metroid its kinda good
[0:45:56] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[0:45:57] EmkaZRC: Yes
[0:46:00] MelvinSoupreme: oh yea
[0:46:01] F1nalStarman: yes
[0:46:04] Senoquese: it is
[0:46:07] JaAmfan: @Zerunus super is a 10/10 and probably the best entry to the genre
[0:46:09] GolfTermBirdie: oh yeah it is
[0:46:11] Senoquese: LOLLL
[0:46:21] Romblymo: its just a sick platformer
[0:46:21] ticklemeastolfo: super metroid is def the best metroidvania format
[0:46:22] Navy_Mongoose: Dark Sols/Bloodborne are metroidvanias
[0:46:29] InsaneLoke: sans
[0:46:32] chewyrock_en: theres a touhou metroidvania where you play as Sakuya
[0:46:34] ticklemeastolfo: i think castlevania does enough different to kinda separate itself as more rpg adjacent
[0:46:38] timinator193: @JaAmfan Super Metroid, my beloved
[0:46:39] pogotross: Well this game is like SotN without the metroid
[0:46:42] ticklemeastolfo: which i also love
[0:46:46] InsaneLoke: whet your PC
[0:46:50] DrkNoodles15: O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills,
[0:46:56] ticklemeastolfo: but these early games are very arcade kind of difficult but short format
[0:47:00] F1nalStarman: SOTN > Super Metroid sorry not sorry
[0:47:06] timinator193: Not the money tiktok thing?
[0:47:07] JTBun: what
[0:47:15] Navy_Mongoose: Castlevania is more like Super Mario Bros, but with a health bar and more powerups
[0:47:18] InsaneLoke: i know it
[0:47:19] ticklemeastolfo: hit that shit ashton
[0:47:21] chewyrock_en: from mario wonder
[0:47:22] Superfroakie82: valid
[0:47:22] ticklemeastolfo: it's a bop
[0:47:23] redactedenheim: oh god
[0:47:30] hideki_iii: Once you hear the soundtrack from this game it WILL get stuck in your head
[0:47:41] chewyrock_en: switch 2 version coming out soon

[0:48:24] DavidPortnov: Wonder is great

[0:48:30] ArthurWar: I loved Wonder, very refreshing 2D Mario

[0:48:53] timinator193: Focus M
[0:48:54] res_ipsa_: reddit flower

[0:53:23] PSYCOMMUnist: When you're swearing in an hour or two you'll understand.
[0:53:41] Captain_Doomsday: Medusas are probably THE most annoying. Everything else is some kind of managable or one-time horror.
[0:53:47] Navy_Mongoose: entire series has great music
[0:53:59] GManx0: She hates plataformers. My GOAT is Washed
[0:54:01] pogotross: oh it fuuuuuuuucks
[0:54:03] GolfTermBirdie: its good
[0:54:06] DavidPortnov: It's a banger.
[0:54:07] Navy_Mongoose: and Mario Bros?
[0:54:07] MageShady: The soundtrack keeps you going tbh
[0:54:07] Romblymo: Konami does sorta do amazing music
[0:54:08] Reflow_max: Yesss
[0:54:12] ticklemeastolfo: this game originates a looooot of tracks
[0:54:16] yojamjam: castlevania one of few nes games that can hang with mm2's ost
[0:54:17] ticklemeastolfo: that get remixed for literally the entire series
[0:54:18] DavidPortnov: Correct.
[0:54:18] Navy_Mongoose: you playued Mario Bros
[0:54:19] chewyrock_en: thats accurate
[0:54:21] Captain_Doomsday: I'll rip the bandaid off now; Bloody Tears debuted in Castlevania 2.
[0:54:23] JaAmfan: wily stage 1?
[0:54:28] Captain_Doomsday: So the BEST track isn't in 1
[0:54:31] demon_dandy: Yeah youre absolutely gonna recognize these songs i think
[0:54:34] Captain_Doomsday: But there are other good ones
[0:54:35] chewyrock_en: okkesenman
[0:54:36] Navy_Mongoose: Crash Man strage?
[0:54:43] JaAmfan: thats the memed track that okkusenman is based on
[0:54:45] Captain_Doomsday: Rondo of Blood
[0:54:46] ticklemeastolfo: rondo of blood
[0:54:48] pogotross: if you don't recognize them now you'll recognize them later
[0:54:52] Navy_Mongoose: Rondo Of Blood/Dracula X
[0:54:54] res_ipsa_: Richter is in Rondo and SotN
[0:54:56] fatcacha: ashton51Alien ashton51Alien ashton51Alien
[0:54:57] ticklemeastolfo: only game where he's the main playable character
[0:54:58] rebelearthsky: Castlevania gets a lot of love.
[0:54:59] ataraxiablue: Richter is Rondo of Blood
[0:54:59] buruhas: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[0:54:59] chewyrock_en: ultraman 7
[0:55:01] MFPUMA: that's the yaranaika song
[0:55:02] EmkaZRC: Why would he be a smash bros only character Ashton pls
[0:55:03] GManx0: Brentalfloss is stuck in my head forever
[0:55:09] G_Panda_Lesser: He's also in symphony of the night
[0:55:10] Zumoggu: Okkusenman!
[0:55:10] F1nalStarman: @GManx0 +2
[0:55:15] Navy_Mongoose: you mean Air Man Gataosenai?
[0:55:19] hideki_iii: Castlevania music will get stuck in your head
[0:55:26] Captain_Doomsday: The ending of Rondo is also the very opening of Symphony of the Night, so technically Richter's there too.
[0:55:34] chewyrock_en: Hyadain did a rockman parody song back in the nico nico days
[0:55:34] Captain_Doomsday: Team Nekokan is great. It's original!
[0:55:37] Senoquese: ashton51Dansen ashton51Dansen
[0:55:38] MageShady: Shes probably busy cleaning her bed LUL
[0:55:40] Navy_Mongoose: it's an oriignal song, but it's about Air Man
[0:55:45] Captain_Doomsday: Can't Defeat Airman isn't a remix or cover.
[0:55:52] DavidPortnov: I love Rondo!
[0:55:53] EmkaZRC: No it's not 2
[0:55:55] EmkaZRC: No
[0:55:57] ticklemeastolfo: Rondo isn't 2
[0:55:57] ArthurWar: Rondo is not 2, 2 is another Simon adventure
[0:56:00] pogotross: no SOTN is like castlevania 8 or something
[0:56:01] yojamjam: sotn is not 3 it's way later
[0:56:01] Navy_Mongoose: no, Sotn is liek... 7
[0:56:04] fatcacha: rondo isnt 2
[0:56:04] res_ipsa_: Rondo is the 5th game I think
[0:56:06] ticklemeastolfo: it's kind of its own thing that was on the pc engine first
[0:56:06] EmkaZRC: Castlevania 3 is Castlevania 3
[0:56:09] JaAmfan: 1 and 2 are on the nes SOTN is the ps1
[0:56:10] Captain_Doomsday: No, SotN is...yeah, it's not numbered, but it was on PS1.
[0:56:11] ticklemeastolfo: and got ported to a bunch of things later
[0:56:17] buruhas: the order is like... 1 2 3 4 rondo symphony?
[0:56:23] G_Panda_Lesser: Simon's Quest is castlevania 2
[0:56:24] fatcacha: its spans generations
[0:56:26] rebelearthsky: The Netflix original series Uncle From Another World references Castlevania.
[0:56:28] Navy_Mongoose: Alucard takes a 100 year nap after 3, and comes back in SotN
[0:56:32] F1nalStarman: The Annihilation of Monsteropolis by the Megas is another great Air Man song
[0:56:32] JaAmfan: castlevania iv came before sotn
[0:56:43] Senoquese: LOL
[0:56:45] Navy_Mongoose: there's a lot of Jojo's comparisons in this series btw
[0:56:46] demon_dandy: It was one of the wily stages i feel
[0:56:48] MageShady: bet
[0:56:48] JaAmfan: wily fortress 1 and 2 are the same song
[0:56:54] Captain_Doomsday: I just have the early games collection on epic, but that has 1-4 and the 2 game boy games.
[0:56:59] fatcacha: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[0:57:00] GolfTermBirdie: yeah
[0:57:02] Captain_Doomsday: So I know Rondo and Symphony must be after those
[0:57:07] Navy_Mongoose: Wily Fortress 1 from MM2
[0:57:10] protostache: Crash Man's theme might be the one you're thinking of, the parody is called Crash! Let's Do it!
[0:57:20] Navy_Mongoose: unless you're thinking of different games and songs
[0:57:22] Captain_Doomsday: What song are we looking for?
[0:57:31] F1nalStarman: Wily Fortress 2 is the super famous one
[0:57:36] JaAmfan: the intro song?
[0:57:36] Captain_Doomsday: Okusanman?
[0:57:42] GolfTermBirdie: not okkusenman right
[0:57:45] Navy_Mongoose: try Wily Boss 1 from MM3?
[0:58:02] MageShady: Idk mega man but I know peak when I hear it
[0:58:06] GolfTermBirdie: NO I KNOW i meant like the tune...
[0:58:08] Captain_Doomsday: Okay, so an explicit track from MM2
[0:58:12] Captain_Doomsday: NOT a cover based on it
[0:58:17] Captain_Doomsday: Bubbleman theme?
[0:58:24] protostache: Oh my bad I missed that part mintcLmfao
[0:58:26] GolfTermBirdie: is it woodman?
[0:58:44] JaAmfan: there is a hayadain parody song of bubbleman
[0:58:45] GolfTermBirdie: love woodman's
[0:58:52] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:59:01] GolfTermBirdie: whoaa
[0:59:08] rebelearthsky: Should have done your retro reps.
[0:59:11] F1nalStarman: There was an OC Remix of Bubble Man I used to listen to alot iirc
[0:59:19] GolfTermBirdie: badass
[0:59:19] Captain_Doomsday: I know there is that Duane and Brando cover of the whole MM2 OST
[0:59:20] JaAmfan: nice
[0:59:23] azziewatermelon: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[0:59:26] Senoquese: this one used to be a kinda popular meme
[0:59:28] Superfroakie82: woodman of course has a parody cover its just from a different meme culture
[0:59:30] Senoquese: >:]
[0:59:36] F1nalStarman: @Captain_Doomsday +2
[0:59:42] MageShady: rattik2Dance rattik2Dance rattik2Dance
[0:59:56] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:00:08] GolfTermBirdie: this was super popular in chile and some latin american countries for some reason
[1:00:15] Navy_Mongoose: listen to the Duane and Brand0 rap
[1:00:32] Captain_Doomsday: Unironically, the Duane and Brando thing will take you through every track so it's valid
[1:00:32] MageShady: Oh thighs were out
[1:00:33] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy
[1:00:34] ChunkBeefthrust: there was raw thigh
[1:00:35] redactedenheim: raw thigh?

[1:00:55] space_toilet_master: hi ash khubieArrive
[1:01:02] MageShady: we had thigh sashimi tonight
[1:01:20] Captain_Doomsday: Maybe it was another Megaman track?
[1:01:25] Senoquese: LOL
[1:01:29] GolfTermBirdie: YEAA
[1:01:30] Captain_Doomsday: OR, it could be from the Power Fighters so it's a different version?
[1:01:36] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi ashton51Bocchi
[1:02:02] Navy_Mongoose: you should play MM3 just for the soundtrack
[1:02:06] JaAmfan: mega man 2 on gameboy has one of the worst OSTs of all time especially needle man
[1:02:07] GolfTermBirdie: not flash man right? which ones have we gone through
[1:02:08] protostache: meatsWOOYEAH
[1:02:14] F1nalStarman: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[1:02:19] Captain_Doomsday: Does Metal Man have a weakness or is he just a chump?
[1:02:34] Navy_Mongoose: @Captain_Doomsday he's apparently weak to Quick Boomerang
[1:02:36] Senoquese: LOLLL
[1:02:40] GolfTermBirdie: the quick man rap
[1:02:54] JaAmfan: metal man's is his own power lol
[1:02:56] Captain_Doomsday: @Navy_Mongoose Weird. Most had some logical connection back then.
[1:03:00] rebelearthsky: Old game design.
[1:03:00] Navy_Mongoose: Metal Man's also weak to Metal Blade, so, himself
[1:03:03] chewyrock_en: have you played the battle network games
[1:03:03] ticklemeastolfo: it depends on the game
[1:03:13] ticklemeastolfo: it gets more logical later but there's still plenty where it's like...what
[1:03:15] pogotross: most of them make sense....
[1:03:19] Captain_Doomsday: @Navy_Mongoose I guess you find that out in the boss rush?
[1:03:26] GolfTermBirdie: whoaaa the title theme for MM2 is peak wth...
[1:03:38] MageShady: using "doesnt have a parody song" as a metric is crazy btw
[1:03:40] GManx0: She dont know ball
[1:03:40] F1nalStarman: You just kinda memorize the weaknesses from trial and error tbh
[1:03:43] bonatide: Hello ashton.
[1:03:45] GolfTermBirdie: that DOES make sense though
[1:03:46] demon_dandy: Oh yeah theres a fun mgs1 easter egg with castlevania
[1:03:47] Captain_Doomsday: It's pretty funny that Metal Man is such a wimp most players start with him but his weapon is the most consistently powerful.
[1:03:52] bonatide: Hi pitcrew ashton51Heyyy
[1:04:02] rebelearthsky: If you want to play a really weird retro game try Ecco the dolphin. The logic behind some stuff was confusing.
[1:04:03] Navy_Mongoose: it's a MGS quote
[1:04:05] GManx0: MGS
[1:04:08] GolfTermBirdie: no no its Metal Gear
[1:04:09] JaAmfan: in megaman 1 fire man is weak to ice man's weapon
[1:04:16] Captain_Doomsday: Isn't Quick Boomerang the Bubble weakness? Like it's sharp so it pops them?
[1:04:17] bonatide: Yt chat fumbling a bit again...
[1:04:19] Navy_Mongoose: if you have a save file of SotN when playing MGS, Psycho Mantis will point it out
[1:04:20] ticklemeastolfo: mgs1 has a easter egg
[1:04:21] GolfTermBirdie: psycho mantis reads your saved games
[1:04:22] ArthurWar: Psycho Mantis reads your memory card and recognizes Castlevania
[1:04:28] redactedenheim: metal geat? spongebob? same thing
[1:04:32] ticklemeastolfo: if you have castlevania sotn save data on your memory card
[1:04:33] demon_dandy: Nono in mgs1 psycho mantis can read your memory card and if it has castlevania on it he'll say that
[1:04:34] pogotross: bubble man's weakness is having his bubbles popped
[1:04:35] MageShady: Oh its Psycho Mantis!
[1:04:38] ticklemeastolfo: psycho mantis will read it
[1:04:38] Captain_Doomsday: Spongebob gear...
[1:04:43] Navy_Mongoose: she played the PC version
[1:04:45] ticklemeastolfo: and have a line about it
[1:04:50] Navy_Mongoose: so no Castlemania quotes
[1:04:53] ArthurWar: It might have said "your memory is completely clean" for you maybe
[1:04:55] JaAmfan: you can customize your virtual memory card in the collection on PC
[1:04:59] pogotross: psycho mantis on PC should read your tax documents
[1:04:59] GolfTermBirdie: he just reads your current kill count on PC
[1:05:02] ticklemeastolfo: oh my god
[1:05:07] rebelearthsky: The wii was fun.
[1:05:11] redactedenheim: fake retro confirmed
[1:05:11] Senoquese: why dont you remember every single quote on the game are you even a real fan lol
[1:05:13] Navy_Mongoose: in the GC version of MGS, he says SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE!
[1:05:18] Captain_Doomsday: You are a very METHODICAL man. The kind who kicks his tires before leaving the truck.
[1:05:18] demon_dandy: You cam actually have a fake memory card to emulate that on the hd collections its kinda neat
[1:05:27] demon_dandy: Its like a setting
[1:05:41] pogotross: classic egirl with no womb game boy
[1:05:45] MageShady: Growing up is realizing you can play retro games whenever you want

[1:43:29] Navy_Mongoose: they couldnt make consoles work
[1:43:42] PSYCOMMUnist: SEGA owns Atlus
[1:43:42] Navy_Mongoose: I think it was 87?
[1:43:46] hideki_iii: Can't wait to hear this iconic soundtrack
[1:43:51] Navy_Mongoose: about the same time iirc
[1:44:02] pogotross: if we had pepelaugh this is where we would pepelaugh
[1:44:03] PSYCOMMUnist: Yeah SEGA bought Atlus and Sammy
[1:44:34] rebelearthsky: Supposedly the dreamcast killed Sega. The Dreamcast was notorious for being easy to pirate so supposedly story goes that one person would buy a game, and then everyone had a copy.
[1:44:37] Navy_Mongoose: ooh Castlevania was 86, a year before Mega Man 1
[1:44:41] EmkaZRC: Yes. Castlevania is '86 and Megaman 2 is '88

[1:45:35] ArthurWar: Don't think so
[1:45:43] Shulovestacos: They hadn't invented sound yet
[1:45:49] F1nalStarman: You kids complaining about Retroarch when it's way easier to use than anything that existed 15 years ago ashton51Omegalul
[1:45:51] PSYCOMMUnist: @AshtonMarten I recommend the menu called Ozone it's at the bottom of the user interface menu
[1:45:57] pogotross: the sound is 2d
[1:46:11] JaAmfan: @F1nalStarman standalone emulators for 8 bit consoles were way simpler than retroarch tbh
[1:46:26] Senoquese: no wayy i completely disagree yeah
[1:46:31] demon_dandy: ashton51Wibble

[1:46:51] pogotross: @F1nalStarman Nah, every other nes emulator was just "file->open file"
[1:47:01] HmmHrmHarumph: @F1nalStarman I use standalone emulators over Retroarch most of the time. Its so much easier
[1:47:15] demon_dandy: Is it on the switch classics collection?
[1:47:26] Senoquese: even zsnes that forced its own interface on you was so much easier to use

[4:44:54] DavidPortnov: @AlexDD00 This
[4:44:57] cho__aniki: those fireballs do too much damage
[4:44:58] timinator193: @pogotross She does just stand there...
[4:45:25] fatcacha: kill the macaco first
[4:45:27] DavidPortnov: This is what devs wanted. Soulcrushing, but addictive.
[4:45:36] GManx0: So locked in
[4:45:43] timinator193: No dodge run
[4:45:46] GManx0: Take a bite
[4:45:50] F1nalStarman: the monke
[4:46:05] JTBun: you dont gotta continue
[4:46:13] JTBun: you seem to not be having fun
[4:46:23] pogotross: I'm telling you right now it only gets harder
[4:46:35] TheAsterite: castlevania wasn't about fun, it was about perseverance
[4:47:00] timinator193: Avoid
[4:47:04] timinator193: damage
[4:47:05] pogotross: don't touch the boss, use your whip's length
[4:47:16] pogotross: yes you can
[4:47:26] HmmHrmHarumph: he comes to get you. you don't have to go to him
[4:47:41] timinator193: Can she destroy the projectiles?
[4:47:42] y2kkmac: in the wise words of DEVO, when a problem comes along, you must whip it
[4:47:48] pogotross: ashton it's only going to get worse
[4:47:58] pogotross: like legit this isn't the hardest stage or the hardest boss
[4:47:59] JTBun: not a bad sport lmao
[4:48:02] demon_dandy: Youre fine ashton ashton51Tehe
[4:48:11] JTBun: this is for you ashton
[4:48:11] Senoquese: thats not true and why would that even matter
[4:48:12] GManx0: You might be too harsh on yourself when tired
[4:48:12] JTBun: not us
[4:48:17] JTBun: if you dont have fun then dont
[4:48:23] demon_dandy: You got the full castlevania experience
[4:48:25] timinator193: Ashton...
[4:48:27] Senoquese: please just stop playing if youre not having fun
[4:48:35] deafmutelaughing: most people who played this got to around this part then gave up and returned it
[4:48:35] GManx0: Ashton, It is fine
[4:48:42] AlexDD00: I think people just want you to have fun, all that other stuff is not important
[4:48:43] HmmHrmHarumph: @pogotross this is the hardest boss tbh. Stage 5 boss is easier with the items given to you on the same stage
[4:48:43] pogotross: Stare it's not fun if you're actually sad
[4:49:10] deafmutelaughing: oh come on
[4:49:16] y2kkmac: you're absolutely NOT a bad sport if you stop playing castlevania

[4:49:44] DavidPortnov: Totally fine.
[4:49:46] JTBun: this game is hard
[4:49:50] F1nalStarman: You got farther than expected tbh
[4:49:54] JTBun: its fine
[4:49:56] timinator193: Save state!
[4:50:00] JTBun: no one will care
[4:50:00] Senoquese: youre the streamer, if you dont wanna play it nobodys making you play it
[4:50:04] pogotross: @F1nalStarman I thought she'd maybe beat the second boss tbh
[4:50:06] bonatide: Her white whale...
[4:50:07] demon_dandy: I mean you dont gotta if you not feeling it

[4:50:53] F1nalStarman: You skip directly to Castlevania 4, Rondo of Blood, or even Symphony of the Night and I seriously doubt anyone would mind.
[4:51:08] TheAsterite: castlevania 4 isn't easy either
[4:51:14] TheAsterite: just skip to sotn ashton51Tehe
[4:51:26] pogotross: wait don't skip to sotn play Super Metroid first
[4:51:30] funnyplanet1: rondo of blood is nice
[4:51:39] timinator193: @pogotross co-signed
[4:52:04] dynamozx05: may I give ya a tip?
[4:52:05] Iz_zl: just put a save state here berylcPat
[4:52:13] HmmHrmHarumph: throw the water! ashton51Baby
[4:52:18] HmmHrmHarumph: oh
[4:52:19] TheAsterite: i'd be happy with castlevania 1 until it gets conquered pahichStronk
[4:52:19] timinator193: Dont just stand there
[4:52:31] timinator193: jump around
[4:52:35] demon_dandy: could save state now ashton51Heyyy
[4:52:39] deafmutelaughing: honestly metroid 1 is easier than this
[4:52:51] pogotross: You can do anything you set your mind to :)
[4:52:53] timinator193: @demon_dandy ashton51Heyyy

[4:53:47] pogotross: @timinator193 she's anti save state, there's no point
[4:53:47] timinator193: ashton51Pathetic
[4:53:49] GManx0: Why does Frank have a monkey
[4:53:53] F1nalStarman: The nihilism is creeping in
[4:53:58] JTBun: you are just going to hate playing it more lmao
[4:53:59] TheAsterite: would you like the secret recipe?
[4:54:14] fatcacha: let her cook her gaming instincts will kick in let her do her thing
[4:54:17] pogotross: to grind against the boss, figure out the pattern, and then go back and beat it legit
[4:54:32] timinator193: You don't need meta, just mental fortitude
[4:54:45] demon_dandy: I think at this point just let her play it out
[4:54:45] GManx0: You could just play the Pixel Bloodstain
[4:55:02] timinator193: Good luck Oshi ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[4:55:11] demon_dandy: The fucking monkey...
[4:55:19] F1nalStarman: Each hit from the monke does so much damage
[4:55:23] springhearty: EA SPORTS. It's in the pain.
[4:55:27] flickmannss: hope you're having fun ashton ashton51Baby

[4:55:57] demon_dandy: Sooo this or ssx tricky again nemimi2Pien
[4:56:01] dangladdy: I'd say castlevania 1 is fair enough to not need a save state. you have no continues forcing you back to the beginning like other sadistic games
[4:56:37] GManx0: You could just fight Dracula on Smash Ultimate and call it a day
[4:56:55] Fennerdude: i believe
[4:57:15] WumblyGrumbly: it's ok ash this game is from the before times
[4:57:37] TheAsterite: kids had nintendo power for hints
[4:57:53] dynamozx05: Ight, if I recall correctly easier said than done, but if you can keep the holy water, you can attack Frankenstein approaching him frontally right from the get-go (you can start to attack him before the monkey detachs from him) and bomb him with the holy water, he'll go down way easier
[4:58:12] pogotross: move forward so that you're right foot is over the ledge, it should keep the bat from spawning
[4:58:15] speedy_acorn: There's 2 chickens
[4:58:44] dangladdy: hang in there, ashton. you got this

[5:14:22] JTBun: most NES games are frustrating lmao
[5:14:34] dynamozx05: yea, most of the strategies with the bosses here is just finding the correct sub-weapon and blasting them with that
[5:14:41] Senoquese: why does that matter
[5:14:42] timinator193: Oh brother
[5:14:44] JTBun: who cares
[5:14:49] TheAsterite: on legitimate hardware you'd have game genie
[5:14:53] TheAsterite: ashton51Nerd
[5:14:55] pogotross: if you were playing on real hardware you'd feel bad about buying it and beating it in a night
[5:14:58] PSYCOMMUnist: You're only gonna' live once Ashton it's better to get through more games than repeat infinitely.
[5:15:08] JTBun: its that are you go insane

[5:16:59] JTBun: NES games were from a time where they took a lot of inspo from arcade games, aka... they are so fucking bullshit. So save stating is 10000% okay
[5:17:03] speedy_acorn: Suffering part 2 is here
[5:17:27] timinator193: Hard game tbh

[5:21:39] TheAsterite: holy water is op for certain enemies
[5:21:41] PSYCOMMUnist: It's good for bossing not the levels.
[5:21:48] PSYCOMMUnist: It devastates Dracula.
[5:21:50] timinator193: And it's funny ashton51Hehe

[5:22:03] bonatide: The piss baby is the point
[5:22:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we literally played this game with a game genie/gameshark ashton we cheated harder than save states back then
[5:22:11] HmmHrmHarumph: you literally are doing good though. You haven't even played for 4 hours
[5:22:16] GManx0: You took like an hour to get there. Most games dont get to that point
[5:22:17] timinator193: @yojamjam Here it comes
[5:22:38] Senoquese: i think peoples answer to that is what shows if theyre one of the ragebaiters helping the rage or not ashton51Tehe
[5:22:45] fatcacha: you’re a grower
[5:22:55] dynamozx05: Holy Water is OP against the correct bosses

[5:27:03] demon_dandy: ashton51Heyyy
[5:27:03] yojamjam: this is a really impressive first session with cv1
[5:27:15] buruhas: I'm sure the bosses are a breeze in that game too
[5:27:15] DavidPortnov: I think it's trolling.
[5:27:16] pogotross: why do you think they didn't port it to the US?
[5:27:19] fatcacha: lmaoo
[5:27:21] aureliangates: yes you're getting trolled

[5:27:38] yojamjam: also symphony of the night is nothing like this
[5:27:40] JTBun: itll make you cry tho
[5:27:42] bonatide: All games are ez for a gamer like you
[5:27:53] pogotross: one guy? nah, all guy'd
[5:27:55] fatcacha: the story of mother 3 is better than deltarune to me
[5:27:55] deafmutelaughing: I just like the idea of sans in old games
[5:27:58] JTBun: no
[5:28:01] Senoquese: kinda
[5:28:02] Envivii: nah
[5:28:03] DavidPortnov: We could.
[5:28:16] demon_dandy: You gotta eat too
[5:28:16] DavidPortnov: Didn't know that was on the table.
[5:28:23] Senoquese: @demon_dandy this
[5:28:25] y2kkmac: fwiw SotN is nothing like this
[5:28:25] timinator193: go eat
[5:28:31] timinator193: WALL CHICKEN
[5:28:42] F1nalStarman: NO, we keep telling you this
[5:28:42] pogotross: It's like this but with equipment and level ups
[5:28:51] DavidPortnov: Well, you could grind in SOTN.
[5:28:52] pogotross: and way more modern and fair
[5:28:52] Patware: castlevania 1 is easily the worst and most fucked up of the entire franchise
[5:28:53] yojamjam: there's still subweapons and hearts but you have rpg health
[5:28:53] F1nalStarman: Metroidvanias are not like this
[5:28:54] PSYCOMMUnist: SoTN has the same enemies but you'll be way more equipped to beat their ass
[5:28:55] y2kkmac: "metroidvania" refers to Igavanias
[5:28:56] timinator193: ashton51Omegalul
[5:29:01] HmmHrmHarumph: @Patware killing you
[5:29:02] timinator193: yawn ashton51Omegalul
[5:29:05] demon_dandy: That boss is also insane and you beat it
[5:29:05] fatcacha: sotn is at least fair
[5:29:09] Senoquese: you wanted to watch a movie because the stream was early and you still wanna watch it after stream was later? ashton51Tehe
[5:29:12] TheAsterite: sotn has exploration
[5:29:15] TheAsterite: and backtracking
[5:29:25] PSYCOMMUnist: SoTN has backtracking, RPG elements, exploration, it's not a linear platformer at all
[5:29:30] F1nalStarman: Dark Souls and Team Fortress are both 3D. Are those the same game?
[5:29:38] PSYCOMMUnist: Correct
[5:29:42] willquinn_: 3 is maybe the best, but also torturous
[5:29:43] pogotross: I SWEAR TO GOD IF ANY OF YOU SPOIL THE BIG THING WITH SOTN I WILL BE SO MAD
[5:29:44] CommodoreGigglez: Castlevania 1 is a great time because it’s annoying difficult.
[5:29:46] fatcacha: that’s how kids used to play
[5:29:46] yojamjam: character progression through gear and exp, so hard bits can be beaten with stats
[5:29:56] EmkaZRC: @Patware Nonsense. Castlevania 1 is great
[5:29:57] timinator193: Okay ashton51Love
