[0:44:11] lunkloaf: Oh yeah.  I saw the video.
[0:44:20] papayadance: wow that's nuts
[0:44:24] demon_dandy: Yeah cause some people were completely immune and it really messed things up

[0:45:20] demon_dandy: I always heard people with red hair were like extremely likely to resist anaesthesia ashton51Tehe
[0:45:27] MetroIceberg: Another stupid thing.... Some people have redundant pain receptors in their teeth, so Novocain and other anesthetics sometimes don't work...
[0:45:46] jack_sp2: Congrats on the successful appendix yeeting btw
[0:45:55] c_v_catullus16: Triaged?
[0:46:02] daniel_casalotta: Bets advice when getting wisdom teeth pulled is to keep the medicine they give you for tooth pain. It works great as headache medicine (trust me, I‚Äôve done it before).
[0:46:07] demon_dandy: LOL
[0:47:00] Democyde: yup, sepsis.
[0:47:00] ChewyChio: sepsis yeah it goes in your bloodstream
