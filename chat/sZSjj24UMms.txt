[4:56:21] demon_dandy: conker is uh.. the last person you raided into playing it was not having a good time
[4:56:30] DavidPortnov: Conker I don't think holds up quite as well.
[4:56:30] yojamjam: rare only made one good 3d platformer and you've played it
[4:56:32] TheAsterite: crash is a linear platformer, conker is an open world platformer like banjo
[4:56:33] pogotross: yes please
[4:56:39] Senoquese: @yojamjam this ashton51ICANT
[4:56:40] JTBun: conker is only a cult classic because its classic
[4:56:41] rikkaonline: play country please
[4:56:45] Ragatags: Crash first Conkers second. I think you would enjoy Conker more after Crash
[4:56:46] DavidPortnov: @yojamjam Banjo Tooie. Exactly.
[4:56:48] JTBun: *crass
[4:56:53] JTBun: not classic
[4:56:56] ArthurWar: DK64's still the game with the most collectibles ever in a video game
[4:56:58] demon_dandy: Dkc is hard but its good i promiseeeee its so awesome
[4:56:58] pogotross: no you don't why do you lie

[4:57:52] Senoquese: now imagine a whole game of "what the fuck do we do" ashton51ICANT thats both dk64 and conker
[4:57:59] ArthurWar: I don't think Conker is really close to one or the other, it's one big interconnected world but not anywhere near the scale of Tooie
[4:58:28] Ragatags: @Senoquese conker does it so batshit insane that its good imo
[4:58:30] GManx0: She just hates Peak SMH
