[1:10:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: idk why people keep saying its not
[1:10:07] RedSunOvahParadise: Rosenberg aint around

[1:10:19] SoundBorg_wav: Yeah, because they were all Barney LUL
[1:10:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: shoulda played it and yet here we go
[1:10:30] demon_dandy: @mrp0p1nfr3sh apparently it clashes with some story
[1:10:30] Bellophon: All the Gearbox Half-life expansions just cover different characters during the same timeframe.
[1:10:33] lanturn1: Barney sounds the same too, just less crunchy
[1:10:35] Lord_Zelix: 20ish years
[1:10:40] BrushfireGlow: some fans remade half-life 1 in this engine and extended/improved the Xen portion of the game in a version called Black Mesa: WELL worth the playthrough
[1:10:46] SoundBorg_wav: Also that's Dr. Bubby, not Dr. Coomer LUL
[1:10:51] Burr11: yeah its a time skip because you were put in stasis after HL1
[1:10:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @demon_dandy i mean idk im not gonna spoiler
[1:10:53] RedSunOvahParadise: i prefer the original over black mesa

[1:11:03] JTBun: it stutters during loading, it's fine
[1:11:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Are you rendering in OPENGL? or DirectX?
[1:11:17] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh its not that
[1:11:24] JTBun: @mrp0p1nfr3sh it's just hwo source works
[1:11:24] demon_dandy: Thr game just stutters during loading, its always done that ashton51Tehe
[1:11:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: renndogShrug
[1:11:34] SoundBorg_wav: Well yeah, because every security guard was Barney LUL

[1:47:07] Kitkattack: it's been alright for the most part until now
[1:47:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it might be best on a different day?
[1:47:14] Senoquese: its been consistently stuttering sadly
[1:47:16] demon_dandy: I think another day when its better...
[1:47:18] JTBun: yeah the frames get pretty bad

[1:47:22] Baked_Snake: it gets bad
[1:47:22] Burr11: its okay ashton51Love
[1:47:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its not your fault
[1:47:26] newdlebomb: It cuts in and out but its not too bad
[1:47:27] SoundBorg_wav: Maybe drop the resolution or framerate??
[1:47:27] Burr11: i'm glad you're loving it!!
[1:47:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: im just here for you.
[1:47:30] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten you do what you can Ash, its not your fault.
[1:47:32] Senoquese: yeah its nothing to do with you of course, its just the internet unfortunately
[1:47:34] Kitkattack: it's nice that you were having fun though
[1:47:35] newdlebomb: I have been mostly listening in ngl
[1:47:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you can try dropping your bitrate?
[1:47:43] InsaneLoke: im enjoying it but im sure it would be better when ur internet decides to let you stream
[1:47:44] kawaiicrew4ever: it happens
[1:47:45] demon_dandy: Im glad youre enjoying it though ashton51Wibble
[1:47:48] Kitkattack: ashton51Love patiently awaiting the next HL2 strea
[1:47:48] DatBoiVLC: @soundborg_vt she's having bandwidth issues with her ISP, there's nothing she can do on her end
[1:47:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: maybe its bitrate related?
[1:47:50] Desaron: it's a perfect game. Play it again after you've rebooted your router!
[1:47:52] SoundBorg_wav: I've already played it, so I don't care, just as long as you have fin
[1:47:52] pingufrend: Hearing you have fun made up for it !
[1:47:57] SoundBorg_wav: *fun
[1:47:59] Senoquese: yeah im really glad youve been liking the game
[1:48:02] BearerOfPeas: @pingufrend agreed
[1:48:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: It sucks that there was 0 stuttering during the pre talk
[1:48:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its weather related i think?
[1:48:27] Burr11: sorry ashi, i can tell you love this game though which is fantastic ashton51Baby

[1:48:38] ApocalypseSC: i dont think you need to restart
[1:48:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: starting from here is fine
[1:48:42] newdlebomb: you don't need to star over
[1:48:46] newdlebomb: its okee
[1:48:46] DatBoiVLC: Without a tracert it's impossible to tell where the packets are actually dropping ashton51Tehe
[1:48:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: MAYBE the pretalk is cursed
[1:48:52] SoundBorg_wav: Nah, you don't need to start over
[1:48:52] Rayterni: No need to start over
[1:48:52] demon_dandy: I mean maybe just to have the connection to the syart
[1:48:54] DeltaMech105: it’s okay
[1:48:57] T33bags: you dont have to start over! it was good to get some progress in it !
[1:48:58] Kitkattack: it's the same but spicy
[1:48:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: maybe we should skip pretalk next time lmao
[1:49:04] Burr11: i dont think oyu have to start over
[1:49:08] DeltaMech105: all right then I’m gonna head to bed soon so goodbye everybody.
[1:49:09] ApocalypseSC: f6
[1:49:12] DatBoiVLC: @kitkattack ashton51Omegalul
[1:49:16] Senoquese: i think having lots of stuff moving on screen like the game is pushing your upload speed past the throttling limit from your isp?? idk im delulu
[1:49:19] demon_dandy: If you do it from the start you have a clean first vod
[1:49:19] DeltaMech105: Goodbye Ashton.

[1:49:51] Burr11: true i guess it depends how clean you want the whole playthru to be
[1:49:53] SurfaceTenshi: blue shift?
[1:49:58] DatBoiVLC: If you reboot your modem and it's having the same issues there's literally nothing you can do, it's up to the ISP ashton51Baby thanks for doing your best today!!! I am still having fun

[1:50:30] InsaneLoke: blue shift wont spoil for anyrthing its not canon
[1:50:31] Senoquese: blue shift is an expansion to 1 where you play as barney but its not canon
[1:50:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: omfg yall its CANON
[1:50:36] Rayterni: It looks like a buffer thing
[1:50:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yall out here saying its non canon and yall keep saying bad ending
[1:50:48] DatBoiVLC: Electrical conductivity can be damaged, especially with old cable
[1:50:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yall just fuckin around.
[1:50:54] DatBoiVLC: *by cold weather
[1:50:56] demon_dandy: No wayyyyy ashton51Wah
[1:51:00] Burr11: lmao internet too trash for mahjong
[1:51:02] Rayterni: oh cool! *.*
[1:51:03] rikkaonline: if the weather is doing anything, its making more people stay home and use the Internet
[1:51:09] Blazemage2001: dialup ashton

[1:51:20] newdlebomb: momshton Momton
[1:51:20] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:51:27] rikkaonline: the way you described it before, the apt complex probably doesnt have enough capacity
[1:51:40] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Pien ashton51Pien ashton51Pien ashton51Pien
[1:51:46] Kitkattack: idk rikka this didn't correspond with peak hours quite like that
[1:51:48] Blazemage2001: i like the glasses tho
[1:52:05] DatBoiVLC: Because of the cold snap I've actually had to replace a few cables that have finally given out on outdoor lines in my area @ashtonmarten
[1:52:11] Baked_Snake: Raid their building with a crowbar
[1:52:13] demon_dandy: Aw hell naw here come ashton and her choppy ahh mangan
[1:52:15] newdlebomb: just prerecord the stream and play that ashton51Smile
[1:52:16] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its internet related cuz that shit happens every cold snap
[1:52:20] DatBoiVLC: So hopefully it's one line they can resolve quickly
[1:52:25] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten you did well today. I am happy you shared with us today despite the problems I appreciate it.
[1:52:29] BNMotive: bnmotiHi
[1:52:34] mrp0p1nfr3sh: as someone in the industry i see it yearly.
[1:52:35] rikkaonline: fiber is probablyall or nothing
[1:52:36] Senoquese: its 100% your isp just fucking up, last time it did this there wasnt any reason behind it either
[1:52:37] Kitkattack: once again outdoor lines to get frozen over and fall
[1:52:56] DatBoiVLC: @rikkaonline the last mile is usually coaxial too
[1:53:09] demon_dandy: ashton out of gigglebits... ashton51Wibble
[1:53:15] LapDanceDietrich: Fell asleep oop ashton51Tehe
[1:53:16] StreamElements: Feel the softness of the cuddliest animal on Earth! Get your Ashton Marten dakimakura today and bury yourself in the softest... fur of any VTuber! https://cuddlyoctopus.com/product/ashton-marten/
[1:53:23] rikkaonline: very depends, i have fiber to my kitchen
[1:53:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: WE should fundraise and get ashton a backup 5G router for these kind of situations
[1:53:34] Senoquese: idk it feels too much of a coincidence to be a new issue behaving the same way
[1:53:36] demon_dandy: ashton51Bork ashton51Bork ashton51Bork
[1:53:39] rikkaonline: her complex has ethernet, not coax
[1:53:44] Burr11: ashton51Bork
[1:53:46] Blazemage2001: ackshully
[1:53:46] DatBoiVLC: Lmao do you have unlimited data?
[1:53:52] demon_dandy: Its worth it to just ask them ashton51Wah
[1:53:58] Rayterni: I have fiber, it's really all or nothing. It looks like a buffer thing. Could it be just Twitch?
[1:54:01] Navy_Mongoose: that's not how that works -_-
[1:54:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I mean maybe we turn off stream avatar for the time being?
[1:54:06] DatBoiVLC: I have to pay extra for unlimited here too
[1:54:07] demon_dandy: We dont see the yippee man in your head...
[1:54:07] ApocalypseSC: !jump
[1:54:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: since thats just added bits being taken up.
[1:54:13] Burr11: ugh i'm getting delulued into thinking the game is at fault because now it's not dropping lmao
[1:54:14] Senoquese: lets please not just throw random ideas around
[1:54:18] BearerOfPeas: wahay!
[1:54:23] Senoquese: its out of her control, thats it
[1:54:28] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten it might be happening because you have a third party router, they used to do that to me in Cox till I bought their crappy box
[1:54:36] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Dance
[1:54:39] BearerOfPeas: maybe steam is just butt
[1:54:41] Kitkattack: guys this is certainly an ISP issue, please do suggest other silly things
[1:54:43] rikkaonline: twitch plays fix all of streamers problems
[1:54:47] Blazemage2001: you should have told them ur a vtuber, ez discount
[1:54:48] Burr11: yeah lol
[1:54:53] Burr11: i'm sure too
[1:54:56] demon_dandy: LMAO anichart too intensive..
[1:54:59] Senoquese: this is an isp issue, please dont suggest random stuff, we had this discussion last time it happened and it was just completely random
[1:55:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Games use more bitrate
[1:55:05] Burr11: ok now it's dropping
[1:55:10] Kitkattack: like from day one here you had issues right Ash?
[1:55:11] Blazemage2001: lmao
[1:55:14] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its still stuttering so its internet yall
[1:55:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: just not a good day.
[1:55:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its weather
[1:55:30] demon_dandy: @senoquese are you sureee it wasnt anichart lagging her ICANT
[1:55:34] Senoquese: LMAO
[1:55:35] rikkaonline: that wont do anything
[1:55:38] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Dance it's aliens
[1:55:40] BearerOfPeas: not dropping for me
[1:55:40] JTBun: @mrp0p1nfr3sh you are literally wrong, OBS uses whatever bit rate you tell it to
[1:55:45] Burr11: nah its just your ISP
[1:55:50] flickmannss: hiii
[1:55:52] Egmanila: "Oh you're a vtuber?" *adds a cringe fee*
[1:55:56] ReyJaggy: you need to heat up some tea and place it above the router and that will strengthen the Ethernet speed
[1:56:01] BNMotive: can you lower your bitrate Ashton?
[1:56:06] BNMotive: that might help
[1:56:12] Desaron: You can try checking task manager to see if anything is spiking and causing excessive resource usage
[1:56:12] Senoquese: it wont
[1:56:15] ReyJaggy: ashton51Tehe
[1:56:15] DatBoiVLC: @reyjaggy this is true, my grandma does this before she facetimes me
[1:56:17] Kitkattack: gib router an esspresso ashton51Tehe
[1:56:17] demon_dandy: I meab no need to fight inn chat guys, let her solve it
[1:56:22] Navy_Mongoose: Ashton gonna have to record a Let's Play of HL2 for us
[1:56:31] Blazemage2001: probably not in that way lol
[1:56:35] ReyJaggy: and espresso above the modem makes it become genki
[1:56:35] StarBoyRoli: The cold is freezing the wifi particles
[1:56:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @JTBun I mean we know games affect bitrate cuz mariokart8 literally can cause frame drops but meh i dont care its just ISP
[1:56:40] flickmannss: just letting you know i had a 32 streak
[1:56:44] Burr11: the only way weather would affect it is if like, there was some wireless or satellite connection involved in bringing it to your building
[1:56:44] flickmannss: also what ahppened to game
[1:56:45] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh thats not how it works
[1:56:47] w_khan3_0: had to fight my ISP for an year to have my download/upload speed to be up to what i paid
[1:56:47] demon_dandy: @navy_mongoose 480p just like god intended...
[1:56:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Dump an espresso on the router *jk dont*
[1:57:02] Blazemage2001: the electrons are cold, let them in
[1:57:06] flickmannss: dang
[1:57:13] RedSunOvahParadise: enkyriStare
[1:57:13] Navy_Mongoose: @demon_dandy with Unregistered Hypercam 2
[1:57:16] JTBun: it's okayyyy
[1:57:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: THE WIFI is cold let them in
[1:57:20] Senoquese: its fine ashy
[1:57:24] DatBoiVLC: There's a difference between frame drops and bitrate compression dealing with too much motion, but they can seem like similar issues @mrp0p1nfr3sh
[1:57:25] JTBun: noooo
[1:57:26] Burr11: it wouldnt have made a different though because its still bad now..
[1:57:28] JTBun: not your fault
[1:57:31] flickmannss: it wasn't  on ur control
[1:57:32] ReyJaggy: wait i missed a stream
[1:57:36] ReyJaggy: my streak!!!
[1:57:37] Rayterni: don't feel sorry, it's out of ur control <3
[1:57:38] SoundBorg_wav: It's okay! Next time erosBunger
[1:57:38] JTBun: it was fine for SMRPG
[1:57:40] Kitkattack: it's evil ISP!!!!!!!!!
[1:57:41] ReyJaggy: ashton51Dentge
