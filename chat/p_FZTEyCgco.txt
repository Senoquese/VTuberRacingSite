[0:43:50] Romblymo: She had to say no though, if she said yes and told us it would be stares of judgement
[0:43:58] Qrockpot: they come from the "scammed by timeshares" generation
[0:44:02] outrunthewind: There's like a gazillion YT videos just about what a nightmare timeshares are

[0:53:30] Qrockpot: they turn it into a 2v1
[0:53:43] nomzoogles: gotta solo it
[0:53:50] Romblymo: It's like watching your partner slowly become evil
[0:53:58] InsaneLoke: no, you are the one wolf. it makes sense
[0:53:59] y2kkmac: I don't think I could ever go through that. I kinda went through something similar buying out a lease at a car dealership. they kept trying to sell it back as certified pre-owned and did every underhanded thing to try to trick me into it and I wanted to break something halfway through.
[0:54:03] demon_dandy: Honestly your pride is really powerful
[0:54:12] redactedenheim: I wonder what happens to the timeshare in divorce proceedings? It'd be like a hot potato and they'd be fighting NOT to end up with it
[0:54:21] MelvinSoupreme: lmfao
[0:54:24] timinator193: You gotta go in knowing they are evil
[0:54:24] outrunthewind: Women in boring marriages are easy to sell on the idea of travel or exotic new experiences

[0:54:56] MelvinSoupreme: do not buy a car right now
[0:54:58] Romblymo: You also had the secondary motivation that if you did get the timeshare we'd never let you live it down
[0:55:00] Qrockpot: ashton51Heyyy

[0:55:32] AyukiAkiba: im glad i watched ashton marten so i could learn to not get scammed by timeshare presentations ashton51Baby
[0:55:33] InsaneLoke: i believed in you the whole time
[0:55:38] Burr11: "I WON... by buying the timeshare"
[0:55:42] Burr11: makes no sense
[0:55:43] 0oGooseo0: sounds like cope on their part ngl
[0:55:43] bonatide: I still half doubt. Like if i showed up one day and you said you got a timeshare i wouldnt be surprised at all
[0:55:53] GManx0: My family trying to get a breakfast in a vacation by sitting through a presentation broke something inside me
[0:56:00] MelvinSoupreme: oh no my shitty dividends
[0:56:18] InsaneLoke: nop
[0:56:19] outrunthewind: No

[0:56:47] F1nalStarman: beribugBuhh beribugBuhh beribugBuhh
[0:56:48] GManx0: IT IS COPE
[0:56:56] Red__2: My parents friend had a timeshare for a boat, when it was explained to me as a kid it didn't make sense and it still kinda doesn't
[0:57:03] bonatide: There's a person whos the right situation for it
[0:57:04] Qrockpot: they got any timeshares in Japan?
[0:57:05] spikebomb5: they have money to burn+time to take off
[0:57:07] Romblymo: Everyone involved in pyramid schemes talk about how great they are
[0:57:07] pogotross: that's just because people don't want you to know the SECRET TIMESHARE TECH
[0:57:15] Burr11: i think in the moment it feels fine, it's the aftermath... also you have to like going to the same place over and over
[0:57:15] outrunthewind: They have to tell themselves it's wonderful otherwise they'll have to face the fact that they got screwed
[0:57:22] Red__2: I think its a generationally coded phenomenon
[0:57:29] demon_dandy: Its really really awkward when your relative come over for a "random" visit and the timeshare comes up
[0:57:30] bonatide: If youre in the right position to own one its nice
[0:57:37] Qrockpot: A point system sounds even MORE suspicious
[0:57:43] pogotross: make it a gacha and I'm in
[0:57:56] rikkaonline: that's the new system they came up with once people learned that regular timeshares suck
[0:57:58] Senoquese: thats scary
[0:58:03] jherchin12345: @pogotross 10pull your timeshares
[0:58:08] demon_dandy: It is essentially a pyramid scheme
[0:58:14] redactedenheim: or sell off the property in hawaii
[0:58:21] rikkaonline: its like airline miles, theres blackout dates and limited availability
[0:58:26] Qrockpot: same thing

[0:58:45] Qrockpot: yep
[0:58:52] outrunthewind: "It's easier to fool someone than to convince them that they've been fooled" This fact is used mercilessly in marketing and politics
[0:58:56] jherchin12345: huh that’s so weird
[0:59:04] AyukiAkiba: making it sound “normal” just sounds like coping from the buyers
[0:59:04] Qrockpot: wait... is disney vacation club a timeshare program...
[0:59:05] MelvinSoupreme: my parents' timeshare operates similarly. you can book in multiple locations but its not cheap
