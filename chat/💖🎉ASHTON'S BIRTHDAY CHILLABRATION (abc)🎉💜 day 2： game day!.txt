[0:39:18] ZoomZabbaBoi: when i leave town, i unplug everything
[0:39:28] HashiriyaR32: My win11 laptop developed a quirk in early 2022 where any sort of cold start (either via shutdown or restart) would result in my Forza Horizon 5 install deleting itself (requiring me fully re-DL the files if this ever happened).  This is why I put it to sleep every time and dread unscheduled updates (which force a restart)
[0:39:31] vtuberacingcorp: We've talked about setting up remote stuff, and I still think we should..
[0:39:37] Sea_Lord_Charles: software lets you access pc at home, use it for my job sometimes
[0:39:41] Playmer: It's not that hard...
[0:39:50] HashiriyaR32: and re-DLing the files required around 1.5-3 hours
[0:39:59] Playmer: I've walker her though a bunch of PC building stuff, she's good :)
[0:40:09] HashiriyaR32: also, it's ONLY that game
[0:40:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its windows 11
[0:40:24] MikeFiro: Computers are complicated :( yall are smart
[0:40:31] rikkaonline: it cant save files that are open, so the state of the files becomes unknown an unstable
[0:40:33] MikeFiro: mahouk3Love mahouk3Love mahouk3Love
[0:40:34] Kitkattack: the yaoi thing???
[0:40:35] demon_dandy: The yaoi thing LMAO
[0:40:36] Senoquese: because youre interrupting system operations, like when its grabbing/saving system files
[0:40:36] HashiriyaR32: I don't have this quirk on my new desktop
[0:40:40] HashiriyaR32: Thankfully
[0:40:41] Egmanila: Forza Horizon didn't want to be played lol
[0:40:46] Playmer: Y'all windows has been janky and weird forever, y'all are not new for saying 11 is janky
[0:40:58] beyowned: It's the difference between going to bed and getting knocked out, one's gonna do some damage lol
[0:41:00] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its because when you force shut down the memory is still holding the files. so sometimes itll dump the files into the temp motherboard memory that the bios is stored on.
[0:41:11] Sea_Lord_Charles: that computer hated its life
[0:41:32] Kitkattack: it's about ram and temp files
[0:41:40] supra_mike: the true forced shutdown just yeet the power out
[0:41:42] demon_dandy: ashton51Wibble
[0:41:44] yaykuit: LUL
[0:41:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i literally answered why lmao
[0:41:50] Matharu_: NOOOOOOOO
[0:41:50] Senoquese: its kinda like that but with system files instead of the cartridge
[0:41:51] Matharu_: mathar3Vanish
[0:41:51] rikkaonline: system files are being opened and modified while the pc runs; if you shut it off suddenly, it cant make sure pending changes all get saved, so files are mismatched
[0:41:52] demon_dandy: Oh nooooo
[0:41:59] Returner7: There's like some background memory management and registry stuff that goes on during a proper shut down lol
[0:42:00] demon_dandy: NOOOOOO
[0:42:06] Sea_Lord_Charles: accidental game corrupt lmao
[0:42:20] Playmer: What @mrp0p1nfr3sh described is an oversimplification, but yes, it's basically that.
[0:42:32] demon_dandy: I think everyones got a handheld corrupt story, usually with pokemon ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[0:42:36] Returner7: Nuclear option LMAO!!!!
[0:42:43] MikeFiro: :0
[0:42:52] Kitkattack: heehoo x86 funny
[0:43:00] Playmer: Okay let's be clear, it doesn't dump anything to the cmos where the bios is stored.
[0:43:04] supra_mike: this is why the "do not turn off or unplug the console while saving" messages exist
[0:43:06] Senoquese: i looove corrupt cartridges
[0:43:13] demon_dandy: Bruhhhhhh
[0:43:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You literally were playing the knockout game with your PC and just kept bodying it every time you choked it out to save your Tabs

[0:43:38] Returner7: Delete system32 mom0kiHehe mom0kiHehe mom0kiHehe

[1:34:34] PastaThief911: I played the actual cabinet one time and controlling is way easier
[1:34:59] demon_dandy: It could just be an interesting thing to check the difference ashton51Tehe

[1:35:27] LobotomyBunny: Yea I had the plug and play namcos way back when lol

[1:36:24] demon_dandy: Galaga is hella fun
[1:36:52] LobotomyBunny: I had the blue one with mrs. pacman and then...I wanna say I had a red or yellow one with differenct games on it? was so long ago tho
[1:36:53] LobotomyBunny: lol

[1:37:42] Kitkattack: there's the legendary spiderman D*** one
[1:37:45] Senoquese: theres so maaaany trashy plug and play consoles and i love them all
[1:37:52] skiedeagle: The arcade version is much different than the plugnplay version. Mainly because the arcade version use a 360 degree spinner for it's controls. Because of that it's a lot harder to emulate the controls with an actual racing wheel or any analog controller. The plugnplay version had to strip the joystick controls due to limitations
[1:37:58] demon_dandy: I had the spongebob nose plug n play lmaoooo
[1:38:00] BearerOfPeas: all star wars media is absurdly complicated
[1:38:08] PastaThief911: I had a cool marvel plug and play and it was pretty fun. The games still hold up today
[1:38:20] LobotomyBunny: The weird spongebob plug and play where the joystick was his nose :P
[1:38:25] Senoquese: theres a chinese plug and play that has bowling but it uses half life 2 characters for some reason
[1:38:34] Kitkattack: lmao the distraction
[1:38:48] demon_dandy: The spongebobg plug n play was so cool to have but the games were kinda ass iirc ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:38:50] PastaThief911: I forgot I had the spongebob one too

[1:40:13] BearerOfPeas: ?????
[1:40:15] LobotomyBunny: Wooooo!
[1:40:21] Kitkattack: that's our queen
[1:40:24] BearerOfPeas: i think it glitched out
[1:40:35] karasahin9696: u lose that only 0.08 sec XD
[1:40:52] demon_dandy: Damnnnn ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:41:42] skiedeagle: That's not the end actually, it's a glitch where it was supposed to hit the extended play, but it didn't count out so you didn't get that 50 seconds. You know you won if you hear the ending music play, in the arcade it's accompanied by an anime girl waving a flag. In the plugnplay version there is no such flag
[1:42:06] Sea_Lord_Charles: wonder if Ashton would try the Atari 2600 version ashton51Stare
[1:42:09] demon_dandy: Oooh interesting skiedeagle
[1:42:18] PastaThief911: @senoquese no that was official. It was half life 2 pin split bowling
[1:42:39] demon_dandy: Damn ashton got hoed boowomp ashton51Wibble
[1:42:48] Senoquese: nuhh it had breen as an old man called "daniel"
[1:42:51] Senoquese: cant be official
[1:43:08] JTBun: boowamp
[1:43:35] demon_dandy: If you got hoed it basically means you got cheated or scammed
[1:43:51] PastaThief911: It was a prequel to half life. It was before the apocalypse and had gmans dad
[1:43:56] BearerOfPeas: i've played this on a 7800, never got passed quali
[1:43:59] BearerOfPeas: past*
[1:44:23] FistOfTheNorthStarState: happy birthday
[1:44:43] skiedeagle: @demon_dandy I had my own luck of researching a whole lot of differences between the ports myself considering I know how the arcade version is supposed to look even if I never played the actual cabinet before. But I believe the namco museum versions are the best of what you can get if you want an actual more arcade like experience
[1:45:06] Senoquese: uh oh.. soon the gay porn screen is gonna show up on the plug n play as well
[1:45:34] Sea_Lord_Charles: Atari 7800 sounds like

[2:11:33] demon_dandy: There was a point in time right when mirage first got his ship event where he was gonna get really serious sad boy lore (which is still there) and be a main focus but they sidelined it
[2:11:50] skiedeagle: Figured it out, there are actually 2 different versions of the same port, I'm not quite sure why that is, but I think the version you're playing came first since the glitch never happened when I played it on my Pac-Man 12 in 1 plugnplay. So I can say the one you're playing is REV0 and the one I played is REV1, will post the video of what I'm talking about on the discord
[2:12:36] demon_dandy: Interesting ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai so shes being held back

[2:15:54] JTBun: yeah titanfall debs made apex because BRs were catching on
[2:15:54] skiedeagle: Just posted the vid I was talking about in general, when I played the last lap of both games back to back, I noticed when the passing score thing was ticking down, the timer still kept going after 0 on the world record video while on the one I sent on discord, the timer stops and plays the ending music like usual, really strange, but goes to show you can never be perfect, unless you are the namco museum ports of those games
[2:15:58] TachikomaKURO: Hey Ashie, how is the race going? ashton51Smile better not put you out of focus on the race!
[2:16:27] JTBun: @Senoquese yeah I believe so
