[0:58:18] Kitkattack: you should totally make like an unofficial group

[0:59:33] rikkaonline: only sort of formal
[0:59:36] su_ki_da: that's a relatable feeling though, indie vtubing seems so large but it's really just a bunch of smallish communities

[1:00:07] rikobutepic: you quit?
[1:00:12] Zurafruit: @JTBun ashton51Despair
[1:00:15] RycegoZ: Ashton on her broke girl arc

[1:00:32] jcall__: @JTBun FACTS!!!!
[1:00:35] rikkaonline: ashton51Blush
[1:00:48] Senoquese: yeah the subathon would actually make it worse LOL
[1:00:48] InsaneLoke: its almost Thursday in a few hour
[1:01:00] noodsdood69: Yeah, more Like Vershion or Clover+ would be optimal, IMO. group of like four Vtubers who collab together and create a little ecosystem :)
[1:01:01] rikobutepic: time to get a cod sponsorship then get a skin pack
[1:01:03] katsuragi_kakeruvt: wasnt it something weird like prime subs arent counted too? LOL
[1:01:06] T33bags: i think youre actually in unofficial groups in a lot of peoples minds like implicit associations but i think youre underestimating your relations with others LOL
[1:01:11] JTBun: gifts and primes dont count towards it either
[1:01:14] Senoquese: @T33bags thats true
[1:01:25] JTBun: @T33bags true
[1:01:36] rikobutepic: the fail girl Five....
[1:01:49] ReyJaggy: I love the fail girl group
[1:01:52] Burr11: yeah i feel like you have an unofficial buddy group
[1:02:04] rikobutepic: just make your own group together
[1:02:11] su_ki_da: i think it's also just a bunch of indie vtubers having chronic social anxiety that a lot of people are put off on interacting with people
[1:02:19] king_okaze_ch: Cheer100 Ashton, are you feeling okay?
[1:02:20] Kitkattack: unofficial is already what you have going on, don't have to have hardlines about collabs and stuff
[1:02:24] fys0n: Good morning Ash
[1:02:28] Navy_Mongoose: !jump
[1:02:34] rikkaonline: i think if you find the group, it will feel right when it happens
[1:02:35] tinysips: i think its easier when you're small for sure
[1:02:39] Burr11: i dont think you should make it serious or anything more trouble than its worth
[1:02:39] Navy_Mongoose: !sit
[1:02:40] rikkaonline: no hurry until then
[1:02:41] Senoquese: i dont wanna be like "if youre sad just be happy" but people really do like you way more than you think. you just gotta ease yourself into seeing that. i think you can do it
[1:02:41] RycegoZ: Having a falling out is better cause you can blame it on someone than feel guilt over something you couldn't control
[1:02:57] king_okaze_ch: Cheer100 Hey ashton, did you ever used to listen to Night Core growning up>
[1:02:59] rikkaonline: relatable
[1:03:02] su_ki_da: yeah, goals and the like have to be aligned, it's easier with corpos since they all have the same goals and backing, they can just focus on being friends
[1:03:15] king_okaze_ch: Favorite song?
[1:03:21] Senoquese: oh jesus
[1:03:28] king_okaze_ch: That was hot a minute
[1:03:32] JTBun: 🤓
[1:03:36] su_ki_da: i think some people also just put too much pressure on themselves for collabs, people don't know how to just have fun with people anymore amalia11Jam
[1:03:42] nullnug: its not even about collabs tho right? like just having closer streamer buds in general
[1:03:43] noodsdood69: Fear is the mind killer. Reach out to all of the interesting people you wanna collab with, and with a little bit of luck you'll form a little group of gorls. I believe in you, Ashton.
[1:03:44] slushpuppy84: do you like Saved By the Bell?
[1:03:56] king_okaze_ch: Woah Saved by the Bell is a throw back
[1:04:09] king_okaze_ch: What about Degrassi?
[1:04:15] T33bags: i think youre actually in unofficial groups in a lot of peoples minds like implicit associations but i think youre underestimating your relations with others LOL
[1:04:21] Navy_Mongoose: It's alright, cuz I'm saved by the bell
[1:04:22] Senoquese: @T33bags ^^^
[1:04:22] fys0n: Will Smith with a Wallstreet phone
[1:04:37] Kitkattack: @T33bags so true
[1:04:59] nullnug: jetsDetective i get it
[1:05:02] justchiken: ashton51Squish
[1:05:05] Burr11: awww ashton51Squish
[1:05:05] su_ki_da: aw ashton :(((
[1:05:07] ReyJaggy: When are you collabing with Dentaman?
[1:05:11] JTBun: you just gotta reach out, then that will happen
[1:05:12] Navy_Mongoose: you heard her boys, slide into her DMs
[1:05:14] king_okaze_ch: Cheer100 SHES JUST LIKE ME FR FR
[1:05:18] su_ki_da: that's a valid feeling to have, it's not whiny
[1:05:20] tinysips: its bc you're 2 cool
[1:05:27] slushpuppy84: VShojo seem fun and friendly
[1:05:30] InsaneLoke: ohhhh THAT dentman. i thought they meant Tyler1
[1:05:31] Burr11: they're probably like "ashton never messages me.. i wish she would ashton51Squish "
[1:05:31] the_ol_regular: koragiDrive
[1:05:35] Retoo542: woah chao garden music
[1:05:37] rikobutepic: its because you intimidate them honestly
[1:05:42] Senoquese: i think people like you way more than you think. you just gotta reach out, its nice to be "adopted" but sometimes you gotta take that first step yourself
[1:05:50] rikobutepic: you have too much girl power, like vtuber super saiyan
[1:05:58] noodsdood69: It's a pretty unique issue, where getting people to stick to you is hard because if you stick to them and they tear away, you lose a little piece of yourself.
[1:06:10] JTBun: I mean, that's why you should reach out more
[1:06:15] JTBun: if thats the case
[1:06:16] fys0n: You're overthinking
[1:06:23] su_ki_da: idk how true this is, outside looking in is always different, but the size diff (like popularity) shouldn't matter to people
[1:06:25] T33bags: i get that feeling but i think its also a lot more common than you think most people dont get reached out to often i think its way more weighted to people reaching out on their own accord
[1:06:30] katsuragi_kakeruvt: yea professional on the outside, then you go the discord LOL
[1:06:35] fys0n: It is fine
[1:06:35] rikobutepic: raviagToasty
[1:06:36] nullnug: true
[1:06:38] Burr11: i know that feel
[1:06:44] su_ki_da: it just depends from people to people it seems (business vs. hobby, fun vs. professional)
[1:06:46] rikkaonline: very relatable. thats why im extremely alone...
[1:06:51] Senoquese: youre very different i think
[1:06:53] ReyJaggy: Your yap skill lvl is just too high
[1:06:55] JTBun: oh I get that, and that doesn't need to be the case. If you get to someone well enough they would probably also reach out to you too
[1:07:01] king_okaze_ch: Cheer100 Ashton were you the type of person to do all the work on a group project? KEKW
[1:07:03] Wreckitron: Hello, folks. Hope everyone is doing well. fillyWaves
[1:07:04] ScarletRook: They feel the thousand yard Pokemon trainer stare and avoid contact
[1:07:11] noodsdood69: Listening to you scream about how much you hate Wonka permanently changed my perception of you LUL

[1:07:16] Burr11: ashton51Tehe

[1:07:16] Senoquese: you gotta reach out. you gotta take that first step. and then thats how people will want to reach out to you
[1:07:20] king_okaze_ch: GOTEM
[1:07:22] fys0n: Me too!
[1:07:27] JTBun: @Senoquese this
[1:07:34] T33bags: too scared to talk to your group members
[1:07:36] su_ki_da: people just imprint certain personalities when they can't interact with you directly
[1:07:39] Kitkattack: the Wonka movie fiyuLUL
[1:07:47] T33bags: @T33bags reading this like its a book

[1:08:21] Navy_Mongoose: I blame twitter for limiting context
[1:08:22] king_okaze_ch: "HOW DARE YOU DO THIS ONE THING THAT I JUST SO HAPPEN TO TAKE OFFENSE TO!"
[1:08:27] Senoquese: on twitter youre professional, on stream youre cute and a bit deranged but still think of what youre saying, on discord you just let it all out and oh god do you have stuff to say
[1:08:33] rikobutepic: what if you collab with venom snake
[1:08:34] su_ki_da: @theelfiestelf I REVERSED THE ROLES LMAO

[1:08:57] the_ol_regular: @kitkattack oh-

[1:09:15] Kitkattack: it wasn't great
[1:09:15] king_okaze_ch: Cheer100 Hey, Ash, would you say you're a cold sleeper? I saw that post of your bed set up and it looks way too cozy.

[1:10:41] Navy_Mongoose: I never thought I 'd say it, but I preferred the backstory in the Johnny Depp movie
[1:10:42] the_ol_regular: Cruella on the other hand
[1:10:55] Burr11: lol she's calling you a child
