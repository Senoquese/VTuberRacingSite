[0:23:18] demon_dandy: fun fact, ashton was the number mk8 streamer for a bit ashton51Tensai (the only one streaming mk8 wii u)
[0:23:27] SetsunaFuyuki: I haven't actually streamed Mario Kart 8 ever so that was my first time streaming it, and I had Matcha and one of our mods visiting from Canada join us, so it was 3vCPUs xD
[0:23:47] SetsunaFuyuki: Yeah
[0:23:49] demon_dandy: number 1! ashton51Tehe
[0:24:10] Based_Bug: I love that wallride
[0:24:32] SetsunaFuyuki: Is this a PlayStation1 era game cuz graphics got me assuming that way xD
[0:24:33] demon_dandy: thats cute tho you had mods visit from canada ashton51Pog
[0:24:44] PikelArt: omg
[0:24:53] SetsunaFuyuki: OH-- really?! Indie from '19? Interesting
[0:24:53] PikelArt: i love that it looks like a ps1 game
[0:25:10] SetsunaFuyuki: It gives me so much OG arcade/PS1/Sega Genesis vibes
[0:25:16] demon_dandy: whats that game? violence squad or something?
[0:25:25] spacechannel4: don't forget to finish packing Ashton ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Tehe

[0:26:54] SetsunaFuyuki: Yeah, KK is one of me and Matcha's friends
[0:26:58] Trent7004: Got a tournament today for forza, starting in bout an hour or so.
[0:27:23] demon_dandy: good luck trent ashton51Baby you got this
[0:27:29] Based_Bug: honestly yeah, it's crazy how small of a world the vtubing community can be
[0:27:32] SetsunaFuyuki: We technically knew each other thru shared interest in rhythm games LOL
[0:27:52] SetsunaFuyuki: But yeah, I found you thru both KK and Matcha since...well, chinchilla vtubers LOL
[0:28:03] honktowndeluxe: vroom vroom. Where are you flying??
[0:28:08] Trent7004: I’ve been on the nonstop grind yesterday that I only got like 2 hours of sleep, I slept through all my classes.
[0:28:12] BrieBits: The car in this game looks a bit too small for the world. Like the scale is off
[0:28:24] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai
[0:28:54] Based_Bug: gotta love the phrase "power meat"
[0:28:56] BrieBits: reminds me of san fransisco rush games
[0:28:57] Trent7004: The Turning in this game is insane.
[0:29:07] demon_dandy: i feel like this isnt japan ashton51Tensai might be the shmeat walls
[0:29:50] Based_Bug: these poor saps thought they could hide
[0:29:55] demon_dandy: ohhhh its EoE connected of course ashton51Tehe
[0:30:31] Based_Bug: attention all power lines, please leave
[0:31:24] SetsunaFuyuki: It does, imagine getting a custom arcade cabinet with this game's theming
[0:31:24] Based_Bug: did you ever play those arcade racing games? where the steering wheels were always super loose and laggy
[0:31:49] Returner7: reminds me of Nitronic Rush w/ extra meat mom0kiSweats
[0:32:01] Based_Bug: I think the only good arcade racer I played was the mario kart one
[0:32:12] demon_dandy: this is gonna sound out there but the car models remind me of the WWF derby game with wrestlers heads on em
[0:32:20] Zerorush: Waa I’m late
[0:32:22] SetsunaFuyuki: @Based_Bug I was more of a Maximum Tune type of person myself, but MK Arcade's not too bad
[0:32:26] spacechannel4: meruru you can racing games at Arcades, like the car seat stuff or bikes?
[0:32:33] SetsunaFuyuki: But Initial D players are of another breed
[0:32:49] Based_Bug: my dream is to play the f zero one, it continues to elude me
[0:33:01] spacechannel4: typing do you.. lol my autocorrect
[0:33:09] SetsunaFuyuki: Oh yeah, I agree, I've yet to see Initial D cabs get overused
[0:33:14] Trent7004: The tournament organizers are making us add Halloween liveries on our cars for the tournament.
[0:33:21] demon_dandy: it was called like WWF crash hour
[0:33:25] SetsunaFuyuki: I know for a fact Maximum Tune ones are definitely popular amongst Round1 frequents
[0:33:49] Zerorush: This game looks jank lol
[0:33:59] demon_dandy: i like wangan midnight cause the names fun to say megumi31Dance
[0:34:11] Returner7: funny, there's a lot of weebs where I live so the Initial D cabs are always half broken and missing shift levers mom0kiWhy
[0:34:12] SetsunaFuyuki: @demon_dandy Agreed
