[1:02:16] gamerfromnowhere92: Hello how is everyone
[1:02:28] JTBun: @Kitkattack combat is good in ZZ the fuck And the writing is actually fun
[1:02:32] Senoquese: you think the combat sucks? D: imo it's the most in depth they've done
[1:02:34] justcerebro: there's not enough going on with the combat for me, it got insanely repetitive insanely fast
[1:02:46] JaAmfan: @Navy_Mongoose i'm about finished with the battle network 1 remake on ds. its very good
[1:02:51] jodehummel: oh god
[1:02:57] Senoquese: oh that's just the hoyo gameplay loop, all gacha games of that genre are like that

[1:03:03] c_v_catullus16: The PArent Trap
[1:03:09] rikkaonline: rofl yeah
[1:03:09] JTBun: yeah the concord
[1:03:24] rikkaonline: it wasnt very practical
[1:03:24] campionrah: Concorde?
[1:03:28] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:03:28] c_v_catullus16: The only thing I know about ZZZ is Lycaon that all the vtubers are thirsting over.
[1:03:29] jodehummel: <3
[1:03:30] JTBun: it wasnt good
[1:03:34] rikkaonline: it was heading out before the crash
[1:03:44] Paperguide: im pretty sure it was loud too
[1:03:45] Kitkattack: @justcerebro hack n slash just with the same enemies and the same 3 moves
[1:03:48] JaAmfan: did you know they repainted the concord into pepsi colors and because the paint was so dark it overheated it
[1:03:56] Burr11: the concorde wasnt that safe
[1:03:57] JTBun: @Paperguide this is an issue too
[1:04:01] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we can go super sonic for funny reasons
[1:04:01] rikkaonline: even subsonic planes fly slower now than they did in the past - speed wastes A LOT of fuel
[1:04:03] atrooper1stw: haiiiiii
[1:04:23] rikkaonline: flying slower is way way cheaper
[1:04:26] JTBun: yeah there is a reason why we stick to slower air travel
[1:04:33] campionrah: Only 14 were ever made and they came to the end of their operational life before the crash.
[1:04:33] Noworksm: Yeah, nobody wanted sonic booms rocking their houses.
[1:04:41] JaAmfan: https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b9d472_f97975728129472bb1e6555a25e23fea~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_62,w_1366,h_770/fill/w_1200,h_676,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/b9d472_f97975728129472bb1e6555a25e23fea~mv2.jpg this is definitely in the running for the funniest aircraft ever

[1:07:36] JaAmfan: I'd imagine the maintenance required is 3x as much too
[1:07:48] DatBoiVLC: virgin tried to do it with planes that travel even higher in the atmosphere and they almost went bankrupt from it lmao
[1:08:00] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the russian version of the concorde only flew like 4 times and they stopped flying it.

[1:54:30] JaAmfan: or grind for weapon energy T.T
[1:54:52] demon_dandy: The momentum is how you beat the lasers part without flashman
[1:54:59] JaAmfan: 3 is my favorite megaman classic game but it has some really fucked platform detection

[4:58:56] JackJaguar_: everything else HEALS him
[4:58:57] InsaneLoke: well thats annoying
[4:59:05] Navy_Mongoose: (it makes sense I promise)
[4:59:08] Hamblasto: Try to not waste ammo
[4:59:12] Navy_Mongoose: also yeah, that's so stupid
[4:59:17] JackJaguar_: get ready to mash the fire button
