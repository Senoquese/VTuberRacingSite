[0:38:56] InsaneLoke: it works different
[0:39:12] phatscout: the mastiff always has and always will be the meemstiff
[0:39:15] phatscout: *memestiff
[0:39:45] JTBun: time travel

[0:39:50] fuzzysite: you gotta think 4-dimensionally
[0:40:26] JTBun: gotta thing with portals... wait, that's a different source game
[0:40:30] JTBun: *think
[0:42:11] demon_dandy: oh hope its all good
[0:42:15] JTBun: yeah, take care of that
[0:42:25] demon_dandy: take your time ashton51Love

[0:44:01] JTBun: LMAO
[0:44:05] maullarmaullar: bamboozled again....
[0:44:11] JTBun: glad it's not anything serious lmao
[0:44:13] demon_dandy: im glad it wasnt anythin srs tho ashton51Tensai
[0:44:18] InsaneLoke: idk how people buttdial with smartphones
[0:45:04] phatscout: my dad has done it a ton of times either and he has an iphone
[0:45:19] demon_dandy: tbh when i  shove my phone in my pocket without locking, buttons get hella pressed ashton51Tensai
[0:45:24] phatscout: actually when he switched from a 6 to a 13 mini the dials stopped
[0:46:16] phatscout: yeah you can do that in settings
[0:46:52] InsaneLoke: though its a bit weird and you have to unbind toggle crouch and bind hold to crouch instead of just switching it
[0:47:00] InsaneLoke: if i rember correctly
[0:47:05] demon_dandy: the funny soccer ball ashton51Pog
[0:48:12] InsaneLoke: movement shooting time :sunglasses:
[0:48:59] demon_dandy: if you kill them in the future, they die of embarrassment in the past ashton51Tensai
[0:49:14] phatscout: it's a style of game that's kinda fallen by the wayside and while it's easy to see why (there were a lot of pretty awful linear setpiece driven games during the early 2010s) you're deffo starting to see people get sick of 200+ long ubisandboxes where you climb towers to unlock parts of the map or whatever
[0:49:30] ArdenYves: geegaPaper
[0:49:45] demon_dandy: TPFufun
[0:50:18] demon_dandy: they still got british people in the future NotLikeThis
[0:50:22] phatscout: i've been thinking about that cuz GamingBrit's latest vid (the RE4 one) talks about this in relation to that game vs the prev REs
[0:50:50] phatscout: and RE4 was one of the first games that really made that kind of setpiece driven design a thing
[0:51:46] demon_dandy: almost made it ashton51Kneel
[0:52:20] phatscout: a lot of people describe this game as "Mario esque" due to how each level introduces a concept on a set of base mechanics and explores it throughout the level
[0:52:33] InsaneLoke: im all out of cheese! eeeek
[0:52:57] phatscout: but RE4 is also a pretty big touchpoint for that style of "this is how you structure an action game"
[0:53:03] ArdenYves: a lot of people describe this as a video game geegaOops
[0:53:07] phatscout: also this is mario esque cuz you're jumping on some platforms lol
[0:54:50] demon_dandy: sup mrvn ashton51Baby
[0:55:08] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai gotta do the thang
[0:55:11] InsaneLoke: parkour!~ parkour!~

[0:55:49] ArdenYves: the demon core geegaWoah
[0:55:58] JTBun: they big bad guys
[0:56:03] InsaneLoke: that looks like my   fridge
[0:56:10] InsaneLoke: fridge?
[0:56:20] JTBun: sadly yeah the only level
[0:56:23] phatscout: yeah it's just this level
[0:56:31] demon_dandy: lmaooooo just a lil bit of mass war crimes for the imc
[0:56:49] phatscout: pretty much level has it's own mechanic tho
[0:57:02] demon_dandy: imc*
[0:57:11] InsaneLoke: movie time
[0:57:33] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog
[0:58:20] InsaneLoke: lastimosa was bt's last dude i think
[0:58:22] InsaneLoke: wait
[0:58:24] InsaneLoke: hmmm
[0:58:34] demon_dandy: howd he end up dunked in da conkreet ashton51Tensai
[0:58:44] phatscout: lastimosa was bt's last dude yeah
[0:58:59] InsaneLoke: probably time traveled at the wrong point
[0:59:05] demon_dandy: i headcannon he got super power bombed by a robit
[0:59:05] maullarmaullar: endless consoomers
[0:59:07] phatscout: also this stuff does come up in apex in relation to a. uhh certain character
[0:59:08] ArdenYves: captain barbossa geegaNODDERS
[1:00:01] demon_dandy: the fun time travel or the itty bitty bit of warcrimes
[1:00:03] CINO_p: something about everyone being expendable or something
[1:00:05] InsaneLoke: none of the frontier people are connected directly to the apex peeps
[1:00:41] InsaneLoke: you are the frontier, fighting the IMC
[1:00:48] JTBun: ^
[1:00:56] demon_dandy: this place is imc
[1:00:57] phatscout: well you're the militia
[1:01:04] CINO_p: ah yes, lets look at the manuscripts ashton51Tensai
[1:01:14] InsaneLoke: you are the good guys yes
[1:01:28] JTBun: yes, you are good guys rebelling
[1:01:36] demon_dandy: would a good guy shoot this innocent robot twice ashton51Tensai
[1:01:46] InsaneLoke: IMC is a corp. trying to take control of the small communities living in the frontier
[1:02:03] demon_dandy: innocence grenade launcher ashton51Tensai
[1:02:07] JTBun: yes
[1:02:08] InsaneLoke: ur the star wasr rebellion
[1:02:09] phatscout: yeah this.. isn't that complicated
[1:02:39] phatscout: the militia in the broader universe are fleshed out to be a bit more grey than just "the goodie guys" but the IMC are much space fash industrialists
[1:02:49] phatscout: *are pretty much
[1:03:38] InsaneLoke: the IMC has full control basically of the main solar system (with like earth) so its made up of people just fighting to make a living not knowing they are doing bad thing
[1:04:01] CINO_p: bless üôè
[1:04:22] demon_dandy: its like gundam, but you ship the pilot with the mech
[1:04:42] JTBun: lmao yeah, like gundam
[1:04:48] JTBun: good example
[1:05:05] demon_dandy: ashton51Tensai
[1:05:17] InsaneLoke: the mastiff would be so much stromger if they just shot it sideways
[1:05:26] phatscout: this is basically a less fujo version gundam wing
[1:05:33] demon_dandy: lmaooo style switching
[1:05:34] JTBun: BT is a good boy and can fight on his own with cool AI
[1:06:01] demon_dandy: bt speeeeen ashton51Pog
[1:06:35] phatscout: this final fight actually has a pretty clever piece of design
[1:06:46] phatscout: in that you cant use your shield cuz that buttons remapped to time shifting
[1:06:56] InsaneLoke: the left side  room facing out
[1:07:01] phatscout: which seems like an oversight but really isn't
[1:07:16] phatscout: cuz you're supposed to just timeshift as a shield
[1:07:28] demon_dandy: ion lessgooo ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[1:07:30] InsaneLoke: lstar time
[1:07:45] phatscout: E
[1:07:47] JTBun: hold E
[1:08:08] InsaneLoke: bt can travel back, the time shifts are for healing/ taking better position
[1:08:14] InsaneLoke: i love data knife
[1:08:23] JTBun: the smart knife is so cool
[1:08:29] phatscout: it's funny that you hack with your knife but you just punch people to melee
[1:08:45] JTBun: q to laser
[1:09:02] InsaneLoke: yeah ion is weird, i used scorch and nothing else for my playthroughs
[1:09:08] phatscout: also I just realized they don't have firestars in apex
[1:09:22] JTBun: Scorch my beloved
[1:09:26] CINO_p: oi my eyes
[1:09:29] demon_dandy: CaitlynS
[1:09:55] maullarmaullar: such a cool set piece
[1:10:29] InsaneLoke: arc star hud effect
[1:10:29] demon_dandy: demon core moment
[1:10:35] InsaneLoke: cause its the ark
[1:10:37] InsaneLoke: lol
[1:10:58] maullarmaullar: NO
[1:11:19] JTBun: BT and Cooper saving the world
[1:11:27] demon_dandy: typhon ashton51Pog
[1:11:42] maullarmaullar: the fold weapon implies the existence of a call weapon and a raise weapon
[1:11:52] InsaneLoke: savin da farms
[1:12:09] JTBun: THIS LEVEL
[1:12:12] InsaneLoke: yeah they are little colonies
[1:12:24] InsaneLoke: little for an entire planete
[1:12:29] JTBun: this level is great
[1:12:35] InsaneLoke: he walks so big
[1:12:47] InsaneLoke: BT kabedon
[1:13:07] demon_dandy: ronin ashton51Tensai the blade
[1:13:10] InsaneLoke: sword time
[1:13:14] InsaneLoke: ash vs caustic
[1:13:34] JTBun: bunkers yeah
[1:13:41] demon_dandy: lmaoooo maybe only a bit
[1:13:55] phatscout: Kane is just caustic if he was a gamer
[1:14:14] mushi_buns: 40 tonüò≥
[1:14:31] phatscout: Kane isn't really much of a character tbh he's just a meme cuz he's acts like a toxic gamer
[1:14:40] phatscout: literally calling you a scrub
[1:14:54] InsaneLoke: yearp
[1:15:28] InsaneLoke: you must now be microwaved
[1:16:21] JTBun: yeah the deviced died in the Ark blast
[1:16:34] demon_dandy: hes helicoptering ashton51Baby
[1:16:37] InsaneLoke: i wish you could use other skills in the campaign. cloak is boring i wanna use zip
[1:17:30] demon_dandy: zipline ashton51Pog
[1:17:35] phatscout: grappling hook
[1:17:38] InsaneLoke: grapple! like pathfinder but longer and yiu get 2
[1:17:59] phatscout: path used to have 2 grapples around launch right?
[1:18:00] JTBun: yeah zip is inane in multiplayer
[1:18:18] demon_dandy: i dont think so scout, but it was wayyyy better
[1:18:30] PastaThief911: just got done watching megamind with my family Cheer1 Cheer1
[1:18:42] InsaneLoke: he got nerfed around season 5 or something then given multiple as a rebuff then taken away and given the cooldown per distance sytstem
[1:19:04] InsaneLoke: megamind bible>?????
[1:19:09] maullarmaullar: do i have to play mega man before i watch megamind
[1:19:12] PastaThief911: I love megamind. It's probably my top 5 movies of all time. I got it on dvd
[1:19:24] JTBun: private server are the only real way to play it now i believe
[1:19:32] PastaThief911: megamind is the prequel to megaman
[1:19:40] phatscout: I haven't played for a while but I was under the impression path's cooldown always worked the same as grapple in this
[1:19:56] phatscout: where it's not a fixed "x seconds" but based on how long you were grappling
[1:20:15] demon_dandy: it was like fixed 8 sec cooldown on launch
[1:20:21] InsaneLoke: the TD|2 grapple is so fun
[1:20:29] phatscout: ex if you only grappling for 2 seconds it's not the full cooldown
[1:20:41] InsaneLoke: multiplay is taken over by spiteful hackers but there is a fan made client that fixes the issue
[1:21:08] phatscout: in this I know you can "corner walls" in this with effectively zero cooldown penalty
[1:21:08] JTBun: softball is cool
[1:21:10] InsaneLoke: its called Northstar
[1:21:38] InsaneLoke: do not hurt!!
[1:21:46] JTBun: a lot of people that play TF2 now are insanely good at it
[1:21:53] demon_dandy: poor dude NotLikeThis
[1:21:58] JTBun: YOU MADE HIM SAD
[1:22:01] InsaneLoke: microwave time
[1:22:06] phatscout: this is a video on how nuts grapple tech is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cviVhtoAiME
[1:22:16] phatscout: i wanna say most of this still applies to pathfinder as well
[1:22:25] Knightwind97: dogo :v kawaii desu?
[1:22:41] demon_dandy: Lmaoooooo ashton51Heh
[1:22:47] JTBun: any green light you hit with the arc tool
