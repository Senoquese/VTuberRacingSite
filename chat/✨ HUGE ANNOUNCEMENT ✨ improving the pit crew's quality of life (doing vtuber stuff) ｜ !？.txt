[0:38:09] rikkaonline: why not both?
[0:38:10] Burr11: rather spend channel points...
[0:38:10] Kitkattack: definitely dollar
[0:38:16] Cannonaire: TTS is usually behind bits on channels.
[0:38:17] BlackOppsRage: get that bag but make tts longer?
[0:38:18] B_R3Dfoksu: Dollar
[0:38:18] InsaneLoke: a dollar would be more reasonable to prevent spam
[0:38:20] Returner7: huh? doesn't bits already trigger TTS?
[0:38:35] Senoquese: your channel points stuff ARE really expensive compared to others tbh but i prefer it this way
[0:38:36] DatBoiVLC: TTS should always be minimum of a dollar, it can be both but the channel points should be high ish for sure
[0:38:38] Burr11: longer cooldown imo
[0:38:40] T33bags: we need someone versed in game theory and economics to budget these cheese wheel redeems
[0:38:40] Burr11: and more points
[0:39:18] Senoquese: yeah streaming w a 3d model is a wild west
[0:39:19] Kitkattack: I agree with seno, I think your channel redeem economy is good if not on the expensive end
[0:39:35] Mocchiari: What would you even use to stream with a 3D model?
[0:39:41] Cannonaire: What's the announcement!? Something about a giant lizard?
[0:39:42] Egmanila: We can get biblically accurate Ashton!
[0:39:42] BlackOppsRage: rather on the expensive end than cheaply abused
[0:39:45] ReyJaggy: you know tits but have you heard of tetas? (twitch extra throwing armament system)
[0:39:56] Senoquese: theres like 5 different 3d apps and they all do different things
[0:40:03] T33bags: you need a timer on the glasses to turn off and the redeem cool down i know you were worried that people would think your model always has glasses but i dont think thats the case either
[0:40:06] DatBoiVLC: Heh... Congress
[0:40:06] BlackOppsRage: can we elect a board of corrupt board members to abuse people

[0:41:03] curation: Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!' That's just way too cute!
[0:41:05] kyle__senpai: Glasses costume?

[0:41:12] T33bags: you  need a timer on the glasses to turn off and the redeem cool down i know you were worried that people would think your model always has glasses but i dont think thats the case either
[0:41:22] Senoquese: the chilla and uguu voice need to be cheaper with how often you forget to do them LOL
[0:41:27] Burr11: uguu voice should be timer and not forgotten.. i got scammed ashton51Wah
[0:41:33] curation: yes its the fubuki copypasta lol
[0:41:42] Rotok_Eralil: You could make a glasses emote that is a shitty obviously not part of model paint version

[0:43:45] Rotok_Eralil: I miss google fiber in Kansas City (moved)
[0:43:47] Zerorush: it practically is a monopoly. all of the ISPs agree not to do business in certain regions to avoid competing with eachother
[0:43:50] T33bags: the standard is actually lower ashton LMAO
[0:44:04] Burr11: it's a monopoly because ISPs are like "we're not spending millions digging holes for all the lines if you dont give us a monopoly"
[0:44:07] DatBoiVLC: If Google fiber opens in a city it forces the entire market to compete with them for price, only time I've seen US prices be decent
[0:44:14] kyle__senpai: @zerorush a cartel, which is kind of worse
[0:44:26] Zerorush: yup
[0:44:28] InsaneLoke: i had a similar issue when i moved into my current place. they only had verizon and i had xfinity. i had them come and drill a hole through my wall and set up the building to have access to xfinity without asking my landlord lmao
[0:44:48] Navy_Mongoose: Newer infrastructure there, easier to work with
[0:44:55] Kitkattack: a lot of time they'll just lease the poles from other companies and smaller isps don't actually own any infrastructure

[3:44:54] Senoquese: hmm
[3:45:18] Senoquese: i dont think you can, its only tracking parameters
[3:45:30] Senoquese: afaik the idle only works if it doesnt detect you there, you cant just toggle it on
[3:45:51] Senoquese: youd have to do the breathing thing and just set really low values and high smoothing
[3:46:09] noodsdood69: wooooo smoothing
[3:46:15] Senoquese: yeah ashton51Tehe but its better than nothing i guess

[3:47:41] Senoquese: do auto breathing and auto blinking at once? itll be a little random

[3:52:51] DoingDennis: Ashton you are so gangster!
[3:52:55] Senoquese: your best shot might be enabling auto breathing and blinking, then turn smoothing all the way up

[3:53:16] Egmanila: LOL
[3:53:19] Rayterni: Bon Boss <3

[3:53:55] Egmanila: It's always fun waking up and seeing how late the last Ashton Twitter notification is
[3:54:10] Senoquese: auto blinking? it should randomize a bit
[3:54:16] Senoquese: since blinks are random

[3:58:28] noodsdood69: so like 2 and -3 for a total of 5
[3:58:47] Senoquese: oh but that means he'd sway to one side more
[3:58:55] noodsdood69: that is the problem, yes
[3:59:05] Senoquese: the twitch is the blink
[3:59:14] noodsdood69: softform acting weird from a hard turnaround?
[3:59:28] Senoquese: i guess the smoothing isnt high enough to counteract the blink motion
[3:59:32] Egmanila: Just make him sway a tiny bit more towards Ashton ashton51Squish ashton51Love
[3:59:43] Senoquese: yeah it doesnt work like that since the frequency will adjust with the max and min values
