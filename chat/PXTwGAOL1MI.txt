[3:11:11] InsaneLoke: it was good
[3:11:13] Navy_Mongoose: dw, it sucks
[3:11:15] InsaneLoke: golden wind
[3:11:28] demon_dandy: Notice how there was no tuesday this week? Strange huh?
[3:11:32] uro_no_arasoi: just another thursday sunday
[3:11:34] pingufrend: erp i meant not watching the last ep of peacemaker
[3:11:57] InsaneLoke: i liked the animation of GW more than any of the other parts, it was so unique compared to the other parts.
[3:12:19] Superfroakie82: the twist was funny at least
[3:12:26] pingufrend: im not much of a plot watcher but i was entertained!
[3:12:31] Navy_Mongoose: just started Stone Ocean this week, it's not GW/10 - pretty good
[3:12:35] to_aru_Oni: It's okay, just very different from what a lot of people wanted.
[3:12:35] Senoquese: i dont look at anything peacemaker and my twitter was all "lmao this sucked so bad" and upset reaction gifs
[3:12:37] InsaneLoke: season 1 really mogged season 2. the finale wasnt the worst thing in the world but since you didnt like episode 7 i figured youd be saved from the pain
[3:12:41] theSimplechild: GW is a really good adaptation
[3:12:53] Senoquese: gaga wowo
[3:12:54] InsaneLoke: golden wind
[3:13:13] yojamjam: more like broken wind
[3:13:14] InsaneLoke: it was 36 i believe
[3:13:19] SomniaVT: i actually never even finished the adaptation, i loved the manga so much
[3:13:34] spikebomb5: almost asspull fights
[3:13:37] InsaneLoke: sorry its 39
[3:14:01] InsaneLoke: most the jojo parts are between 36-42
[3:14:01] demon_dandy: Its kinda the straw that broke the camels back with david pro
[3:14:15] InsaneLoke: and most jojo parts hardly move so i never understood this
[3:14:16] SomniaVT: True
[3:14:20] Senoquese: im very curious how theyre gonna do this new part especially that the horses and the riders are confirmed cgi
[3:14:27] InsaneLoke: yeah they do
[3:14:30] InsaneLoke: they do every part
[3:14:32] Navy_Mongoose: pretty sure they do
[3:14:50] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese it looked great in the trailer, hardly noticable
[3:14:54] Navy_Mongoose: I assume its when they stopped being impressive
[3:14:58] SomniaVT: they can not mess up part 7 i will cry
[3:15:06] pseudochrome: anime cgi has gotten a lot better these days so it could still maaaaybe be fine?
[3:15:06] yojamjam: i just like rohan ashton51Durr
[3:15:20] theSimplechild: That's fair lmao
[3:15:21] InsaneLoke: if you notice the standing and pan up in part 5, if you go back to other parts youll notice the same thing
[3:15:22] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke my fear is that they can still pick the best looking shots for the trailer and then drop the quality way off in a few eps
[3:15:22] Superfroakie82: yknow that sounds right but yeah i never noticed
[3:15:25] demon_dandy: I mean in the sense that like they were very stiff and rigid animation wise and getting a 5th part of it was too much for me
[3:15:43] Senoquese: yeahhh
[3:15:50] Navy_Mongoose: and these issues started popping up in DiU too
[3:16:07] Burr11: there she goes again ICANT
[3:16:07] InsaneLoke: i thought part 5 had the highest highs of jojo "sakuga" despite that
[3:16:13] InsaneLoke: but also thats most jojo parts
[3:16:17] SantinoHS: ashton51Love
[3:16:19] Senoquese: diu had a BUNCH of mistakes but a lot of it got fixed in the bluray
[3:16:26] Navy_Mongoose: ^
[3:16:43] Navy_Mongoose: watch part 6, it's great
[3:16:47] Superfroakie82: i gotta rewatch the jojos ive been putting off part 6 for years now
[3:16:52] InsaneLoke: i just remember jojotwt shitting itself during the second half of Part 4 airing with the awful key frames
[3:16:54] pseudochrome: ims till so pissed at how netflix did part 6's momentum dirty
[3:16:58] InsaneLoke: remember the killer queen fiasco?
[3:17:03] Navy_Mongoose: ^\
[3:17:12] SomniaVT: Classic
[3:17:14] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, jojos fridays were the best
[3:17:25] yojamjam: they took jojo fridays
[3:17:26] Senoquese: i REALLY didnt like stone ocean i tried watching it during release and then later and i didnt fuck with it at all
[3:17:27] demon_dandy: LOL
[3:17:28] JTBun: i didnt enjoy part 6... the pacing is bad
[3:17:31] InsaneLoke: it took them like 4 years to finish part 6
[3:17:35] InsaneLoke: and it looked bad
[3:17:42] yojamjam: can we do part 6 fridays....
[3:17:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Peacemaker was good
[3:17:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it wasnt amazing
[3:17:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: but it was good
[3:18:07] InsaneLoke: part 5 might have a lot of pan up punching moments but it also has some crazy sakuga moments unlike any otjher jojo part
[3:18:08] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[3:18:09] demon_dandy: Anime club ashton51Nerd

[3:18:32] Navy_Mongoose: you guys didn't finish Initial D?
[3:18:39] InsaneLoke: remember the Metallica vs doppio fight? that had crazy insane animation
[3:18:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we got second stage done
[3:18:54] demon_dandy: @insaneloke i gueeeeess ashton51Tehe
