[1:09:09] metaconstruct: lmaooo
[1:09:17] reycallsounds: riiiiiiigh i love the look they did
[1:09:22] demon_dandy: he does ashton51Baby
[1:09:24] reycallsounds: gonzo was such a wild studio
[1:10:05] spacechannel4: trigun i have no problem with new look, I'm just not a fan of 3d transition. I hope for the best üëç
[1:10:07] demon_dandy: im currently rewatching trigun tho, and what you said about atmosphere applies there too
[1:10:43] metaconstruct: rosario was a gonzo thing right?
[1:11:04] PastaThief911: sana has another non hololive vtuber persona that she did a couple streams about a month ago on so she might still do a little bit. but if she doesn't it's probably better for her health
[1:11:05] demon_dandy: its done by the beastars, land of illustrious people so itll be done right at least, but its def a preference thing
[1:11:40] spacechannel4: @demon_dandy yup yup dandy. I still hope ppl love it
[1:12:31] spacechannel4: lmao Ashton take üíï ashton51Pog
[1:12:52] ajvark: when will u read chainsaw man?
[1:13:26] ArdenYves: basement dwellers hate 3D
[1:13:53] PastaThief911: Mangas cool but there was a christian manga called son of Samson I had when I was little and fuck it went hard. he took a donkey jaw bone and beat the fuck out of a whole army
[1:14:23] thecopperkid: at least crappy 2d is more than 5fps though. 3dcg needs better motion
[1:14:55] ajvark: speaking of 3d anime, when will you watch Lupin III?
[1:15:40] PastaThief911: it's a Bible manga spinoff. the Bible 2
[1:15:47] demon_dandy: i think its cause the bad 3d looks stiff qnd robotic, whereas bad 2d looks wonky and kind of ugly, so it triggers different brain thingies
[1:15:51] thecopperkid: video game cutscenes have gotten better framerates. anime is stuck in ps2 graphics
[1:15:55] ajvark: Bible goes hard sometimes
[1:16:02] metaconstruct: bible EXTRA Encore
[1:16:12] spacechannel4: it's definitely a pref thing I agree. I can move past it for good story. I was big disappointed by dragon dogma Netflix. that's just me üòå
[1:17:02] ajvark: i think people generally have bad opinions and closed minds, and you shouldn't listen to them unless they're nice to you
[1:17:02] demon_dandy: frfr ashton51Kneel
[1:17:02] Core279: *flops in* hullo  .-.
[1:17:40] spacechannel4: asthon calling it out üíïüíï SeemsGood
[1:18:12] Playmer: What do you reecommend?
[1:18:13] thecopperkid: i watch most of them, at least one ep
[1:18:15] demon_dandy: ecchi uhhh is it the cyborg one
[1:18:21] ajvark: @thecopperkid list em
[1:18:22] spacechannel4: ppl feel in love with beastars & company won ppl over SeemsGood
[1:18:31] ajvark: i like dorohedoro
[1:18:33] thecopperkid: lustrous was pretty, but didn't like the story
[1:18:41] demon_dandy: its like re arms or something
[1:18:41] Core279: I'm personally in the camp of "I don't mind 3d anime, but get tweaked when a 2d uses 3d for cheating crowds"
[1:19:19] TheEIectrician: 3d animation in 2d animation can look good, anime just does it terribly
[1:19:25] cakeswindle: ex arms
[1:19:31] spacechannel4: ahhh I still like the jank zombie land saga 3d dance scenes lol
[1:19:33] demon_dandy: dorohedoro was HARD for me to read personally
[1:19:35] MuttleyStrikeout: i really like dorohedoro
[1:19:40] demon_dandy: just visually
[1:20:08] Core279: Stick to one side of the dimension line. The ONLY anime I see that pulls of a good 3d down to 2d, is Land of the Lustrous. If you pay attention to some fights scenes, it switches to 2d for certain "vanishing point" style effects
[1:20:46] demon_dandy: theres quite a bit of mixing 3d and 2d actually, they just hide it better
[1:21:00] spacechannel4: Jojo did 3d opening great
[1:21:26] TheEIectrician: but the part 4 ops are iconic so its fine
[1:21:26] demon_dandy: that was sad, im glad part 6 did em again
[1:21:40] reycallsounds: we love anisong
[1:21:44] TheEIectrician: Phart Four
[1:21:44] spacechannel4: @theeiectrician jammy to "chase you" ashton51Pog ashton51Pog

[1:22:13] TheEIectrician: chase isnt as good as the other ops but i like it
[1:22:20] demon_dandy: chase rules and we cannot compromisr ashton51Tensai
[1:22:31] reycallsounds: chase by bata?
[1:22:34] reycallsounds: from jojo?
[1:22:34] TheEIectrician: fbi most wanted chase you hater
[1:22:35] spacechannel4: noooo NotLikeThis, jk preference üëç

[1:24:53] Core279: My facvorite anime openings are the really jazzy ones. Bloody Stream, Wild Side, Tank, and the openings they used for every Kaguya-Sama season
[1:25:01] demon_dandy: hell yeah, fellow syd gang ashton51Tensai
[1:25:02] PastaThief911: hyvat herrat has a wild intro
[1:25:15] TheEIectrician: the entire cowboy bebop ost goes so fucking hard
[1:25:34] metaconstruct: i still havent watched the last part of kaguya
[1:25:38] MuttleyStrikeout: durarara season 1 op is a banger
[1:25:48] TheEIectrician: like that was the last really big presence of swing or big band type music in pop culture and i kinda miss it
[1:25:49] demon_dandy: hellyeahhhh
[1:25:54] Core279: An EXCELLENT mash up is on YouTube of Bloody Stream, Wild side, and Tank. "Wild Bloody Tank" is the name
[1:25:55] demon_dandy: uragiri no yuyake
[1:26:06] demon_dandy: classic ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:26:22] Core279: It's legit

[1:29:45] TheEIectrician: lets get the children out of the way
[1:29:54] MuttleyStrikeout: omni level judging time
[1:29:58] KyleRokuKyu: Because Aston Martins are the most beautiful nof all cars
