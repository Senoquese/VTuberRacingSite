[1:55:24] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Oh I keep thinking the DS was the same year as the Wii for some reason, I thought it turned 20 next year
[1:55:32] Kitkattack: the original gray ds is so ugly
[1:55:42] DavidPortnov: 100 seems pretty decent.
[1:55:49] demon_dandy: Classic
[1:55:49] rikkaonline: no game that can do widescreen can be retro

[1:57:44] Burr11: the suggestions for brightness are always too dark for me too
[1:57:46] Senoquese: is this monitor hdr? some games force brightness settings if you do
[1:57:58] Superfroakie82: sometimes i wonder if retro as a label should be changed to a time period category, cuz i feel like even kids consider nes retro and dont think of widescreen stuff as retro, like with the "so retro" meme
[1:58:06] ApocalypseSC: !bomb
[1:58:09] JTBun: this game can get difficult
[1:58:15] demon_dandy: Medium seems good, hard can get annoyin
[1:58:15] JTBun: so prob medium
[1:58:16] Navy_Mongoose: probably hard
[1:58:17] Kitkattack: med or easy, this game is pretty brutal at times
[1:58:18] Burr11: medium
[1:58:18] rikkaonline: med is fine
[1:58:18] InXplotch: id say medium
[1:58:24] TheAsterite: hard
[1:58:25] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Medium is Premium
[1:58:27] Burr11: its challenging enough on medium imo
[1:58:33] a_raccoon27: medium
[1:58:34] PSYCOMMUnist: bioshock not really a game for thrilling gameplay more story honestly
[1:58:35] Kitkattack: oh forreal
[1:58:40] chinfoil: easy/medium because hard is alone time
[1:58:40] Fluffyshinigami: The game is unironically easy
[1:58:51] AmethystViper: especially if you have Vita Chambers enabled.
[1:58:52] Senoquese: oh its because youre on fullscreen apparently lol
[1:58:57] demon_dandy: Yeahhhhh LMAO
[1:59:06] Red__2: switching to 160p stream quality to get those CRT retro vibes

[1:59:52] to_aru_Oni: ashton51Bongo
[2:00:03] AmethystViper: Game is kinda low. Also speaking of audio, the remastered version did kina fudge up the FMV audio quality and they are compared in quality. There is a mod to fix that tho.
[2:00:16] AmethystViper: * compressed
[2:00:21] pogotross: here I'll do the subs: glub glub glub

[2:01:35] demon_dandy: I think it tilted up a bit
[2:01:40] JTBun: i think you can put subs on now
[2:01:43] Burr11: ashton51Pog
[2:01:43] Red__2: vessel of transportation sinking?? is that a titanic reference

[3:04:05] AmethystViper: @Senoquese The original PC version can run at 60 but had weird physics issues where it does not update to the higher framerate.
[3:04:17] Senoquese: "The original BioShock (2007) had a physics and animation cap at 30 FPS, which could only be bypassed on PC with a mod that adjusted the frame rate limit for the game's engine"

[4:10:11] Red__2: Skyrim, oblivion orrr morrowind

[4:10:21] Aefen: skyrim or oblivion would be more fun
[4:10:23] Blaisevtch: Oblivion>>>>skyrim for me
[4:10:25] Red__2: orrr go super retro and do arena or daggerfall
[4:10:27] Fluffyshinigami: Skyrim is legit good if you've never played
[4:10:32] Senoquese: skyrims kinda overrated now that ive seen oblivion
[4:10:41] Blaisevtch: sean Bean is also in Oblivion
[4:10:43] DavidPortnov: Skyrim is retro next year.
[4:10:54] JTBun: i think oblivion is easily the best elder scrolls
[4:11:02] bread_dot_: Oblivion's a more fun stream game than Skyrim imo
[4:11:03] DavidPortnov: But I love Oblivion more.
[4:11:09] horribleham: Oh thank god, Ashton stream. I must have got into heaven
[4:11:09] Shrike4MeVT: this is the first one right?
[4:11:13] Red__2: the splicer is a bit dramatic ngl, its only eternal suffering
[4:11:21] Navy_Mongoose: Skyrim was on 360 so it's Retro ashton51Stare
[4:11:29] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[4:11:31] DavidPortnov: Oblivion has been my official favorite game fore a long time.
[4:11:49] bread_dot_: Same, Obliviion's my comfort game
[4:11:56] Senoquese: yes
[4:11:57] JTBun: yes the remake is good
[4:11:57] Aefen: yeah
[4:11:57] metaconstruct: yes very
[4:12:00] Senoquese: its very faithful
[4:12:03] JustWeepin: oblivion is basically just the old game made pretty
[4:12:06] Navy_Mongoose: Yes
[4:12:07] Red__2: remaster is fine, the old one is buggy as all hell
[4:12:12] Red__2: like CTD buggy
[4:12:17] DavidPortnov: Remake is good. It's slightly different, but probably a better experience.
[4:12:17] Fluffyshinigami: Remake still uses the original at its core
[4:12:20] a_raccoon27: the remake is basically just the original with a paint of coat slapped over it
[4:12:26] demon_dandy: It works more like half life weapon inventory
[4:12:31] Senoquese: yeah eep time
[4:12:34] JTBun: whatever you feel like
[4:12:36] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Sound fine to me
[4:12:43] Navy_Mongoose: ...a paint of coat
[4:12:45] Fluffyshinigami: This is a good place to stop

[4:13:03] Red__2: the remake is pretty solid
[4:13:05] AmethystViper: About 10%
[4:13:05] yojamjam: it's basically over
[4:13:09] DavidPortnov: They did change some combat stuff, but not really enough to feel that different.
[4:13:09] Fluffyshinigami: Ten percent
[4:13:11] ApocalypseSC: it's the original engine running underneath unreal for the graphics
[4:13:21] demon_dandy: LOL
[4:13:25] Aefen: LMAO
[4:13:32] sirmars1: Almost finished with the tutorial.

[4:13:37] DavidPortnov: There are plenty of short games out there.
[4:13:46] Red__2: there's the very first elder scrolls like 1&2 if you want 90s retro
[4:13:51] Navy_Mongoose: Star Fox is super replayable though
[4:13:54] to_aru_Oni: Whaaaat. Old games were totally long lol
[4:13:58] Navy_Mongoose: and there is plot if you do the other levels
[4:14:03] yojamjam: well sf64 doesn't show you every level in one run
[4:14:04] DavidPortnov: Or throwback to Daggerfall.
[4:14:05] demon_dandy: You do need to get to megaman 3 or at least hit 4
[4:14:14] yojamjam: it's still short if you lined them all up
[4:14:16] Fluffyshinigami: Mega Man x
[4:14:18] MaunTriel: hiii Ashton hope you having fun fighting splicers ironmouseGOTAGUN ironmouseGOTAGUN ironmouseGOTAGUN
[4:14:30] Navy_Mongoose: but my favorite 90s game is like 20 hours long
[4:14:34] Red__2: there's funny whimsy bugs which are in both and then there's crashing/save destroying bugs which are mostly only in the original
[4:14:35] Fluffyshinigami: 2 left
[4:14:41] Shrike4MeVT: you find them
[4:14:42] DavidPortnov: This has me wanting to run through the game with the Director's Commentary on.

[4:31:16] Senoquese: ashton51ICANT
[4:31:24] bonatide: you hit the satelites clip tone spot on btw
[4:31:30] noodsdood69: crabs don't exist in hot water. the hotness opens their shell-pores and makes the sauce taste seep through. if the meat's plain either it wasn't cooked at the right heat fast enough or they didn't use enough sauce.
[4:31:33] Superfroakie82: well you see they have phantom sauce
[4:31:43] demon_dandy: Nah you got ussssss we were waiting for someone to figure it outtt ashton51Blehhh

[4:33:00] Senoquese: why wouldnt it be?? ashton51ICANT
[4:33:07] Aefen: "why do they cook crabs"
[4:33:08] Red__2: why do they cook crabs?
[4:33:11] pogotross: @noodsdood69 it's okay I believe you
[4:33:22] insp_gadget: there's several things they coat the outside. some of it is to slowly seep in, rather than the inside being flavored. then there's some seafood places where they give you a sauce bowl.
[4:33:24] noodsdood69: why do they cook crabs? the world may never know
[4:33:30] Senoquese: ???????????
[4:33:42] Superfroakie82: i mean you looked it up idk what you want after that
