[1:13:05] phatscout: except shenmue which actually happened
[1:13:06] OomfieChoomfie: Jet set radio isnt a rhythm game tho

[1:14:22] Senoquese: @phatscout i refunded frontiers in the first hour or so of playing 🥲
[1:14:29] flickmannss: noppe
[1:14:29] Senoquese: i couldnt stand the camera
[1:14:36] phatscout: Team Sonic Racing was a baffling followup tho
[1:14:37] keydget: Yeah the game crashing on PC is normal keydgeOMEGALUL
[1:14:38] flickmannss: just Danica making the reference
[1:14:42] a_shybot: why does sonic need to drive a car? almightyHmm doesnt he run faster?
[1:14:50] Xuang101: Change your graphic settings lol
[1:14:52] OomfieChoomfie: try right stick mid air
[1:14:53] JulianoUchoa: Hi Ashie

[1:14:59] Sol_MidGaur: To make it a fair race
[1:15:00] a_shybot: i thought he loves running D:
[1:15:00] flickmannss: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:15:08] phatscout: @a_shybot like if he ran on foot he'd win but he'd be an asshole doing that
[1:15:09] keydget: Yeah i love this game
[1:15:14] Xuang101: Stop using a potato pc miss martin
[1:15:15] Sea_Lord_Charles: why Sonic in a car, is he stupid?
[1:15:28] Xuang101: !jump
[1:15:29] Sol_MidGaur: @senoquese y'know you can change your camera settings in that game
[1:15:34] a_shybot: @phatscout LUL hes limiting himself i like that theory
[1:15:38] Senoquese: @Sol_MidGaur ashton51Smile
[1:15:39] Corey_V_Assistant: @Sea_Lord_Charles Don't worry about it and enjoy the cool game.
[1:15:40] the_shu_longster: Who do you think would win in a fight? A chinchilla or a Guinea pig? Like honestly?
[1:15:46] flickmannss: yes
[1:15:49] phatscout: @Sol_MidGaur tbf the camera is always kinda not great no matter what
[1:15:50] Corey_V_Assistant: Yes.
[1:15:52] behoimii: ashton51Wiggly
[1:15:53] HashiriyaR32: nice redeeM!
[1:15:59] Xuang101: !sling 170 200
[1:16:00] Senoquese: @Sol_MidGaur yes but the camera has a max speed limit that you cant change even if you raise the sensitivity

[1:16:25] Sea_Lord_Charles: right stick
[1:16:27] flickmannss: yes, you use the right stick on a direction
[1:16:30] Corey_V_Assistant: Hand down one of the best racers ever.  I love this so much but by the sounds of it you also had trouble with the PC version too.
[1:16:31] Xuang101: Wow
[1:16:38] Sol_MidGaur: Never had an issue with the camera, in fact this is the first time I've heard anyone not like the camera in frontiers
[1:16:40] keydget: Yeah you can do flips and stuff I think
[1:16:44] Xuang101: olivia50Steer olivia50Steer olivia50Steer
[1:17:07] flickmannss: monkaS

[1:17:29] phatscout: can you store items in this game?
[1:17:31] flickmannss: firework = greenshell
[1:17:34] Senoquese: ulalas boat looks like a shoe
[1:17:39] phatscout: i forgot if that was a thing that you could do in this
[1:17:50] Senoquese: LMAO
[1:17:51] Corey_V_Assistant: I had to get a setting to make this game launch for me. I had this game for like two years and I could figure out what I need to do and I did one small thing and that fixed it. I forget what it was though, sorry.
[1:18:06] arcticsnail61: Sonic fro is amazing idk what chat is talking about
[1:18:06] flickmannss: PRAPERA FOR FLIGHT
[1:18:09] phatscout: firework works like shunt in Blur because you can fire it backwards to counter incoming fireworks
[1:18:09] Xuang101: Love the glasses
[1:18:13] flickmannss: prepare*
[1:18:15] arcticsnail61: Frontiers*
[1:18:16] flickmannss: LMAO
[1:18:24] Sea_Lord_Charles: now we fly
[1:18:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: shes got the SRS glasses on
[1:18:31] Sol_MidGaur: @arcticsnail61 🤝
[1:18:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Isnt this game pretty good for being a decade old.
[1:18:41] flickmannss: LOL
[1:18:52] Xuang101: Is it fun?
[1:18:53] flickmannss: Yes
[1:18:53] phatscout: between ASR1 and Transformed a ton of people from Bizzare joined Sumo which is why the all the weapons have the same fire backwards counter stuff from Blur
[1:19:07] phatscout: @mrp0p1nfr3sh honestly it might just be the best kart racer out there
[1:19:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: she moans and complains when she loses a spot in the race
[1:19:16] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @phatscout One of the best yes
[1:19:17] Sol_MidGaur: I just want another Riders game tbh
[1:19:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: IDK about best
[1:19:33] flickmannss: good try
[1:19:36] phatscout: their take on transforming was way more interesting than MK7 and 8
[1:19:44] phatscout: no Sonic Riders is like SSX but Sonic
[1:19:44] Xuang101: Have you ever played outrun?
[1:19:46] arcticsnail61: No sonic riders
[1:19:47] HashiriyaR32: damn wasps
[1:19:49] flickmannss: at least it didn't crash this time!
[1:19:58] Xuang101: I fricken love outrun
[1:20:14] Senoquese: huuuuuh
[1:20:15] phatscout: you play Outrun 2 yet
[1:20:18] Sea_Lord_Charles: I am really surprised there is no Daytona in this game
[1:20:25] OomfieChoomfie: you can get 3 boosts at the start of the run
[1:20:26] Corey_V_Assistant: Sumo handled the home ports of Outrun 2. So they know sega racing.
[1:20:27] flickmannss: Clueless
[1:20:29] Sol_MidGaur: The Riders 1 aesthetic is easily one my favorite out of any racer
[1:20:34] a_shybot: outrun 2 on the xbox was a bop almightyWICKED
[1:20:40] a_shybot: so much fun
[1:20:55] phatscout: @Sea_Lord_Charles iirc it was licensing stuff with Daytona Speedway + they felt Daytona had been in enough "stuff" yet
[1:20:59] Corey_V_Assistant: Outrun 2 is good but super rare.
[1:21:05] phatscout: @Sea_Lord_Charles like they had the hornet in fighting vipers and shit like that
[1:21:11] Senoquese: its just an item you pickup afaik
[1:21:14] Sea_Lord_Charles: @phatscout ahh that makes sense
[1:21:18] flickmannss: just use item button, that's it
[1:21:20] phatscout: @Sea_Lord_Charles licensing costs was the same reason Miku wasn't in the game
[1:21:21] OomfieChoomfie: its a rare item that you get more when youre losing, like bullet bill
[1:21:35] Senoquese: and i think the coins are just used for gamba
[1:21:35] flickmannss: yeah, like when you get the star or bullet bill
[1:21:46] flickmannss: gacha
[1:21:49] Corey_V_Assistant: All stars are like a item when you are in lower places. It has a higher chance of happening when you are back in lower place
[1:21:49] Senoquese: not actually used in the races, you just use em in a slot machine during loading screens
[1:21:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The coins are good for the loading screens and unlocking characters
[1:22:12] joeylambo: Oh your driving as oolala
[1:22:26] flickmannss: shamefur dispray
[1:22:40] Senoquese: yeah this game is really good despite the bad port
[1:22:49] Sea_Lord_Charles: a lot of the scenery is stunning
[1:23:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: chu chu chu
[1:23:09] Sol_MidGaur: Chu chu chu ashton51Smile
[1:23:13] FrostbyteTigressa: They're not as cool as the Chilla
[1:23:43] Corey_V_Assistant: Being in first is so cool because you can see the scenes transform. Its great.
[1:24:06] Sea_Lord_Charles: this game came out at a similar time to Mario Kart 7, which also had flying and water sections, so was unfairly compared to it
[1:24:15] flickmannss: okay so you do tricks by hitting a direction on the right stick while airbone, you have to be careful and do it BEFORE hitting the ground or else you'll fail the boost
[1:24:39] Xuang101: Wow
[1:24:48] Senoquese: btw ashy the coins are basically just used for gamba during loading screens
[1:24:49] OomfieChoomfie: you can get 3 boosts on countdown, 3, 2, 1
[1:24:57] Xuang101: So was this the second sonic racing game?
[1:25:02] phatscout: MK8 does have water and air stuff
[1:25:04] JTBun: !slots 20
[1:25:20] AshtonMarten: jtbman has won 20 from the slots!
[1:25:21] phatscout: the water and air stuff in MK is nowhere near as interesting as how they did it in this tbh
[1:25:23] anonsama9001: cute
[1:25:24] Xuang101: !slots 20
[1:25:26] phatscout: @Xuang101 yeah this is the second
[1:25:28] Senoquese: yeah this game did it well
[1:25:33] phatscout: @Xuang101 and generally considered the best
[1:25:36] Sol_MidGaur: I prefer her orange outfit but she's matching with you rn lol
[1:25:37] arcticsnail61: This game is criminally underrated unfortunately
[1:25:40] AshtonMarten: xuang101 has won 20 from the slots!
[1:25:46] Senoquese: you cant put your cursor on the other screen?
[1:26:04] Sea_Lord_Charles: !jump
[1:26:05] Senoquese: LMAO
[1:26:07] flickmannss: yeah, in MK8 you just go under the water and glide, here you actually drive as a boat and a plane
[1:26:13] arcticsnail61: If only sega would do something with its other IPs
[1:26:15] Xuang101: Pick someone up
[1:26:31] JTBun: !jump
[1:26:34] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Id let you eat me

[1:26:42] flickmannss: ashton51Squish
[1:26:42] Corey_V_Assistant: @Sea_Lord_Charles The weird thing is the transformation thing is a ref to an old Sega game called Power Drift from 1989. That was a kart racer like Mario Kart but more about the tracks and speed.  When you did well on the tracks your "the kart would transform into either the F-14 from After Burner or the motor cycle from Hang-On."
[1:26:42] Senoquese: LOL
[1:26:45] Sol_MidGaur: @arcticsnail61 what about that JSR leak?

[1:29:54] OomfieChoomfie: you can change the drift direction by stopping and restarting the drift right after, it keeps the boost storage

[1:34:24] joeylambo: I think it was an arcade game
[1:34:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it gives you boost i think
[1:34:41] HashiriyaR32: Tomcats and Super Hornets on deck
[1:34:47] arcticsnail61: Is this space harrier?
[1:34:47] OomfieChoomfie: plane tricks are for movement only
[1:34:51] Senoquese: on the planes i think its for dodging mainly
[1:34:53] Xuang101: Wow the transformations are cool
[1:34:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: no it was first try
[1:35:00] Burr11: hey! how's the super sonic racing?
[1:35:01] Sea_Lord_Charles: in plane mode, it mainly helps evade items
[1:35:06] JTBun: he doesn't
[1:35:07] arcticsnail61: I can't remember this game
[1:35:08] Senoquese: YEA the voice acting is so bad
[1:35:11] Ed_The_Engineer: Hello oh this game brings back memories
[1:35:11] JTBun: the VA in this just sucks lmao
[1:35:30] phatscout: yeah the TF2 characters has a different set of bad soundalikes
[1:35:34] Burr11: this track is nuts
[1:35:44] phatscout: like "mr krabs in battle for bikini bottom" tier bad soundalike imo
[1:35:49] JTBun: she blow on my fish
[1:35:49] HashiriyaR32: both the track AND the BGM
[1:35:50] Ed_The_Engineer: Before Mario kart I played this game a lot
[1:35:51] Senoquese: i think the tf2 characters are all the same vas but given horrible direction and equipment? or was that just an old myth
[1:35:53] Corey_V_Assistant: I am trying not to geek out about everything here. I love Sega arcade stuff.
[1:35:58] Senoquese: same vas from tf2 i mean
[1:36:15] Burr11: uh oh
[1:36:15] phatscout: each platform had a platform specific character iirc
[1:36:33] phatscout: Xbox had Banjo, PC had the TF2 dudes, PS3 had... I think sackboy maybe
[1:36:51] Ed_The_Engineer: And now you could play on Xbox I might return to this game
[1:37:05] Xuang101: Your so used to Mario kart LOL
[1:37:14] Senoquese: i think only pc had exclusive characters besides the nintendo mii and the xbox avatar
[1:37:19] Sea_Lord_Charles: !jump
[1:37:20] Senoquese: but might be misremembering
[1:37:23] flickmannss: ok here's the thing, in flight mode there's no boost for tricks outta nowhere, you have to use the tricks to EVADE hitting something like a wall and it will give you a boost, thihs tracks doesn't have much walls you could hit tho
[1:37:24] Burr11: yeah lol
[1:37:28] Corey_V_Assistant: @phatscout PS3 had no one specially.
[1:37:31] Sea_Lord_Charles: 🤓
[1:37:31] Burr11: just flying from ship to ship
[1:37:43] flickmannss: wasps ashton51Wah
[1:37:49] Sea_Lord_Charles: !jump
[1:37:59] phatscout: @VicesAssistant also I just checked, Banjo was only in the first game
[1:38:01] behoimii: !jump
[1:38:11] Senoquese: SHE DID IT
[1:38:14] Burr11: dominating!
[1:38:19] HashiriyaR32: Is it just me or does the other ship have Sukhois on the deck?  I forgot which variant of the Su-27 or its successors is carrier-capable.
[1:38:28] OomfieChoomfie: no
[1:38:30] flickmannss: no, it;s the stick
[1:38:31] Sea_Lord_Charles: no
[1:38:31] OomfieChoomfie: tricks are right stick only
[1:38:31] phatscout: no you flick the stick in a jump
[1:38:32] Senoquese: pretty sure its just the stick for tricks
[1:38:34] Corey_V_Assistant: @phatscout No worries. Sorry I really love this game and I'm be over explaining a tad bit.
[1:38:41] phatscout: and then if you land correctly you get a boost
[1:38:43] Corey_V_Assistant: No.
[1:38:59] Burr11: !sling 90 100
[1:39:00] phatscout: @VicesAssistant it's all good
[1:39:13] OomfieChoomfie: while in the air after a ramp, but you dont press anything at the ramp
[1:39:27] Corey_V_Assistant: Flick the second stick on pad to trick after a transformation is equivalent from transitioning from jump to glider in MK8.
[1:39:29] Sea_Lord_Charles: Rare
[1:39:30] phatscout: no I mean Banjo was a guest in the first Sega All Stars racing on Xbox
[1:39:44] Burr11: wow thats whild
[1:39:48] phatscout: but only the first
[1:39:53] Burr11: oh no
[1:40:06] Senoquese: LMAO NICE TRICK
[1:40:06] Burr11: ashton51Wah
[1:40:07] Xuang101: Nooooooo
[1:40:13] Burr11: that trick was too cool for the game
[1:40:14] phatscout: the first one isn't even that bad it's just kinda... fine
[1:40:15] Sea_Lord_Charles: nice trick lol
[1:40:16] horribleham: the ultimate trick: crashing the game
[1:40:18] Xuang101: I saw it crashed too
[1:40:21] phatscout: like they stepped their game up a ton for ASRT
[1:40:31] Burr11: lol
[1:40:32] barfchan: ashton51Wah
[1:40:34] Xuang101: Wait did you just recently installed the game?
[1:40:40] flickmannss: dammit
[1:40:44] Sol_MidGaur: !discord

[1:40:47] Senoquese: my nap queen ashton51Love
[1:40:50] Burr11: it sure does
[1:40:54] flickmannss: Once again, Danica
[1:41:01] Sea_Lord_Charles: godaddy is on danicas car
[1:41:07] Xuang101: Oh.. it might be better to restart your PC
[1:41:14] flickmannss: okay here's another tip, in flight mode there's no boost for tricks outta nowhere, you have to use the tricks to EVADE hitting something like a wall and it will give you a boost
[1:41:30] Burr11: just gotta avoid doing that game crashing trick
[1:41:33] Senoquese: i think it might be either hardware specific or some graphic settings, it never crashed for me
[1:41:34] Corey_V_Assistant: Yes godady does exist.
[1:41:46] Corey_V_Assistant: still exist I means
[1:42:03] Burr11: getting domain names for websites
[1:42:03] phatscout: godady was a domain registrar
[1:42:08] phatscout: and the worst one at that
[1:42:08] Senoquese: isnt it just to buy websites
[1:42:08] flickmannss: hosting webages i think
[1:42:33] Sea_Lord_Charles: glove only blocks one, super gloves blocks multiple
[1:42:41] phatscout: I had to watch my manager once argue on a 5 hour call to get our domain off GoDaddy
[1:42:54] Burr11: ashton51Cheer
[1:43:04] HashiriyaR32: you redlined the hot rod so it blew you up

[1:45:07] PastaThief911: I had the same crashing stuff on my Pc but I looked it up and did some system file stuff and it's all good now. I completely forgot what it was though
[1:45:14] imjucario: chocojCheck chocojCheck chocojCheck
[1:45:17] flickmannss: pro tip: you can do more than one trick while airbone, as long as you don't hit the ground while doing it you'll get a stronger boost
[1:45:18] Burr11: why arent you taking the shortcut
[1:45:28] Xuang101: Oh poor ashton

[2:03:37] Burr11: yeah
[2:03:37] Senoquese: no dont worry, 90% of kart racers are reallyyy shitty, like the hello kitty one
[2:03:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we gotta get you to play Blur and burnout series
[2:03:42] ChessCatUWU: Wait until you see the Nickelodeon Kart Racers Trilogy.
[2:03:47] Zerorush: Does anyone remember Blur? The street racing game that had Mario kart like power ups? That game was fun
[2:03:50] Burr11: !stand
[2:04:07] Sea_Lord_Charles: will you try the new dreamworks one?
[2:04:08] flickmannss: too many shovelware and stuff
[2:04:08] a_shybot: i remember blur, it was like mario kart irl LUL
[2:04:09] NunyaBizniz: why are there TF2 characters in this game
[2:04:15] a_shybot: that and split second
[2:04:21] Senoquese: this game was on the ds
[2:04:22] flickmannss: let's see how the Dreamworks Racing game turns out
[2:04:23] Returner7: just the mario kart ones
[2:04:25] Zerorush: Split Second is DOPE
[2:04:27] ChessCatUWU: I think the first one is really bad, the second one is good, and third is mixed.
[2:04:28] YumemiStrawberryJam: The game I recommend then would be the two old ps2 Pixar Cars games that are on stream. I think it would be fun
[2:04:29] Burr11: yea hjust mario kart lol
[2:04:40] PastaThief911: Hype for the online playing with viewers
[2:04:43] Sea_Lord_Charles: Diddy kong racing on ds
[2:04:43] Returner7: and maybe F Zero GX, back compat on wii
[2:04:45] Burr11: Blur was on the Wii i think? that was good
[2:04:47] rikkaonline: need for speed underground for gc works on wii
[2:04:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: was ford racing on the Wii?
[2:05:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Burr11 Blur was never cheap on the Wii
[2:05:09] Burr11: ah
[2:05:12] Senoquese: ford racing was really fun for a licensed game
[2:05:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: MArio kart Wii Was really good
[2:05:18] ChessCatUWU: I ended up getting M&Ms Kart on the Wii as a kid. It wasn't that great and I 100% the game. HypeLol
[2:05:20] Returner7: any crappy Microcenter discount racing games?
[2:05:31] Burr11: Wii was too popular with gaming ignorant people thats why it got shovelware
[2:05:31] Zerorush: Split Second is a racing game that’s on Steam iirc that’s really good. You can trigger events during races like earthquakes and plane crashes that alter the course for the rest for the race
[2:05:34] a_shybot: you ever see the shovelwear to ps2? ;)
[2:05:39] objectivebinary: Tru admittedly
[2:05:40] Sea_Lord_Charles: simply, wii motion controls breed shit
[2:05:43] Burr11: like tons of grandmas bought wiis for the bowling game
[2:05:45] rikkaonline: wii pulled in the casuals
[2:05:57] Xuang101: Oh did you live in an area where games weren't accessible?
[2:05:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The Wii was the cheapest game console to license. Nintendo saw the Gamecube as a flop so they were accepting ANY game on the Wii.
[2:06:02] objectivebinary: The stuff you'd see in Wii bargain bins...
[2:06:07] ChessCatUWU: The casual developers too I guess. XD
[2:06:18] NunyaBizniz: yea...
[2:06:21] Returner7: mom0kiWhy mom0kiWhy mom0kiWhy
[2:06:22] Burr11: yep
[2:06:32] objectivebinary: @mrp0p1nfr3sh Yeah, Nintendo went too far in the other direction there LUL
[2:06:37] rikkaonline: "its just software, anyone can make a game"
[2:06:39] Burr11: is this a time trial thing
[2:06:44] NunyaBizniz: tbf if you get bargain bin anything you shouldnt expect quality
[2:06:50] Xuang101: You gotta look for the gold among the poop
[2:06:58] Senoquese: @NunyaBizniz yeah but sometimes you dont have a choice LMAO
[2:07:06] HashiriyaR32: Guess you're chip outta luck for this one
[2:07:06] Senoquese: its either bargain bin or you play with the mii maker
[2:07:06] objectivebinary: @nunyabizniz fair lol
[2:07:07] Sea_Lord_Charles: same thing happened to the Kinect
[2:07:08] HashiriyaR32: Or now
[2:07:14] Burr11: that was close
[2:07:27] Burr11: oh nooo
[2:07:31] NunyaBizniz: that was a long second lol
[2:07:44] a_shybot: i think it was dependent on speed almightyHmm
[2:07:45] objectivebinary: That was a Frieza second
[2:08:02] Burr11: yeah since they stop the clock
[2:08:06] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you should end in 10 if you want milk shake ashi
[2:08:07] JTBun: what flavor milkshake?
[2:08:21] a_shybot: its depending on speed
[2:08:31] a_shybot: the faster your going it stops time :)
[2:08:41] rikkaonline: and crashing makes it go faster
[2:08:44] HashiriyaR32: so sometimes it makes sense to cut a drift early just to get a boost
[2:08:45] Senoquese: nyoooohhooohoh
[2:08:48] HashiriyaR32: seems like
