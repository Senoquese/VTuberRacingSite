[1:49:17] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[1:49:40] flickmannss: depends on which vowel follows
[1:49:42] Navy_Mongoose: Hunnigan is a girl
[1:49:43] yojamjam: hif

[1:52:11] peachuuuu: i love new ada
[1:52:17] demon_dandy: i dont know what happened in re4 remake
[1:52:18] AmethystViper: Remake Ada's voice-acting is boring.
[1:52:31] demon_dandy: She was kinda fine in re2 remake
[1:52:36] flickmannss: like she's always tired, no commitment to voice her
[1:52:40] Navy_Mongoose: if you're holding an herb, you can press Triangle to combine it with another
[1:52:42] Drunkonpop: it's just less sultry is all.
[1:53:05] buruhas: ashton51Pog boss fight!!
[1:53:10] demon_dandy: She was all good in re 2 remake
[1:53:12] thomas_pitch: EL GIGANTE!

[1:53:16] dax812: Bro that guy looks GIGANTIC! ...wait *realizes i can speak spanish* el gigante!!!!
[1:53:19] AmethystViper: For all the downgrades the PS2 port of RE4 has, it does have a few genuine (albeit minor) bugfixes the later ports did not get and it was techinically the first port with widescreen support but it's anamorphic.
[1:53:20] flickmannss: oh yeah re2 remake and re4 remake aren't the same VA btw
[1:53:22] peachuuuu: re4 remake is the cinematic version of this game so it makes sense i guess

[1:58:51] thomas_pitch: "What the dog doing?"
[1:59:16] flickmannss: first tryyyy
[1:59:26] Navy_Mongoose: You could have saved Ammo by QTEing him whenever he staggered
[1:59:26] demon_dandy: ashton51Uwah
[1:59:46] Navy_Mongoose: This also applies for every single enemy in the game
[2:00:09] Navy_Mongoose: no, you just get free damage
[2:00:17] FilSaFer: hey ashton! hope you're well
[2:00:17] demon_dandy: You can save ammo
[2:00:35] FilSaFer: have you done or would you do a randomizer?
[2:00:40] zerox21xxx: @thomas_pitch He being a silly goober of destruction. bunbun96RISE
[2:00:46] Navy_Mongoose: 1 bullet + QTE + Knife to death, as opposed to 6 bullets, your choice
[2:00:52] demon_dandy: This is her first time playing re4 ashton51Tehe
[2:01:00] FilSaFer: not an RE?
[2:01:03] Senoquese: oot randomizer would be aawesome
[2:01:23] FilSaFer: true true- or a cheat sheet
[2:01:24] Navy_Mongoose: you could do a Zelda randomizer
[2:01:48] peachuuuu: you can usually set randomiser difficulty
[2:02:11] Senoquese: is heheheh is hehehe is that heheheh
[2:02:43] demon_dandy: Legend of ashton ashton51Tensai

[2:03:15] Senoquese: LMFAOOOOO
[2:03:16] Senoquese: MY BAD
[2:03:20] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[2:03:23] Navy_Mongoose: I've started several LttP randomizers and got walled every single time ashton51Angy
[2:03:55] JTBun: randomizers are really complicated, so you would have to get an easy seed to play through it
[2:03:58] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I remember in the QandA a few months ago you said you hadn't done Archipelagos before, would that be something you'd want to try out?
[2:03:59] flickmannss: uh oh, bad doggies
[2:04:07] Navy_Mongoose: it was a winnable seed, but I keep getting filtered
[2:04:07] RezaMaulana98: Classic RE4, goated game frfr
[2:04:23] peachuuuu: there’s usually settings that can make the logic mean you can’t get bricked
[2:04:34] demon_dandy: Yeah thats kinda the red zombie of this game, but maybe less scary
[2:04:45] Navy_Mongoose: like the iguana?
[2:05:00] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[2:05:03] Navy_Mongoose: it's random
[2:05:06] flickmannss: i think its random
[2:05:19] flickmannss: but its most probable they headshotted
[2:05:23] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: So a game Archipelago is basically making multiple games in the same randomizer, and you can do it single player, or multiworld across other people's files.
[2:05:24] RezaMaulana98: Depends on the type of tentacle head that appear
[2:05:31] Navy_Mongoose: well they basically get a 2nd health bar so yeah they're more powerful
[2:05:31] james0f: They are slightly more powerful but happen more often with headshots
[2:05:48] demon_dandy: They arent like more likely to appear because you headshot them if thats what youre asking
[2:05:49] flickmannss: they're called plaga btw ashton51Smile
