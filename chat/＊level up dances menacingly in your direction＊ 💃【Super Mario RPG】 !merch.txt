[2:55:29] Syber_Kara: I think its a lot harder for one to cope with their own death than the death of another
[2:55:46] kris_nero_: like perfect immortality
[2:55:48] InsaneLoke: sheeesh
[2:56:10] notCodorna: maybe it's the fact that you die that gives life importance
[2:56:11] rikkaonline: basically all of these wishes belong to specifc characters in the game
[2:56:16] Senoquese: if ashton could give immortality shed intentionally leave some of us mortal
[2:56:30] Burr11: omg
[2:56:31] Syber_Kara: The fact that it ends means there is meaning
[2:56:35] Burr11: all this talk about death and then you died
[2:56:45] InsaneLoke: it looked like bowser was holding geno

[2:59:12] Nodens64: ashton51Squish
[2:59:16] Senoquese: i mean one person could be immortal and also just be that manga panel of the head in the hospital
[2:59:20] sabinofasho: I’ll be a straight up legend if I was immortal
[2:59:25] Syber_Kara: What if it was like Captain Jack Harkness from Dr.Who. You are just a universal truth, you cant be killed and you stay healthy
[2:59:31] kris_nero_: if we think about perfect immortal no scars or wounds and don’t feel pain or are numb to it
[2:59:44] Nodens64: @Syber_Kara he is pretty handsome, i'd take that immortality
[2:59:47] sabinofasho: are you gonna become a legend when you become immortal
[2:59:56] Burr11: i would just take being guaranteed a longer life and enough health to do more of what i wanted to accomplish before time runs out..

[3:01:05] asilveras: I'd pick absolute control over immortality. Make my life way easier
[3:01:10] kris_nero_: though maybe you’ll live to see space travel and lr aliens

[3:07:51] Senoquese: theres invincibility, immortality, and invulnerability
[3:07:52] Syber_Kara: Immortality means you cannot die. Inviniclbe means you cant be harmed. Generally
[3:08:14] Nodens64: @Senoquese big brain!
[3:08:14] Navy_Mongoose: Mario invincibility: You can't get hurt or die, but you kill everything you touch
[3:08:28] Syber_Kara: if youre immortal you could just fight the government forever in theory

[3:10:29] Syber_Kara: i particularly love iron mice. :3
[3:10:34] Nodens64: @Syber_Kara hmm maybe invincible can be EITHER physical or in spirit (always gets back up) and invulnerable means just  can't be hurt?
