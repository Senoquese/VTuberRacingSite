[0:17:48] Burr11: the drama i heard about JJK was just that the manga was so shocking recently that other mangaka are taking hiatus lol
[0:17:49] noodsdood69: I read the manga and I'm a weirdo, so I'll wait until a season ends to watch it
[0:17:49] demon_dandy: I think someeee people are super critical of certain frames being like less super high definition since its an anime and not a manga
[0:17:56] Senoquese: hopefully not drunk again ashton51Wibble

[0:18:40] noodsdood69: Escanor the king, rest in peace
[0:18:44] phatscout: Literally the only reason it got popular because it was one of the first animes on Netflix weirdly enough
[0:18:51] Senoquese: ONLY SORTA??
[0:18:58] Burr11: everyone needs a loli or shota
[0:19:02] Navy_Mongoose: that makes sense
[0:19:06] JTBun: @Burr11 i don't...
[0:19:09] the_hentai_collector: VoHiYo
[0:19:15] noodsdood69: Diane gets King, Elizabeth gets Meliodas, and Ban gets uhhhhhhhhh King's sister, whatever her name was KEKW
[0:19:20] Navy_Mongoose: I only hear the normiest of people talk about JJK
[0:19:35] JTBun: he's an adult but looks like a child
[0:19:36] ReyJaggy: Some tend to be memorable because of certain way some scenes get adapted
[0:19:40] Burr11: he's an adult but he smol
[0:19:45] Senoquese: normies talking about an anime is a good thing tho, that means its so good it reached a mainstream audience
[0:19:50] noodsdood69: tbf after King got all of his powers he became a DILF
[0:20:06] noodsdood69: nonono, Ban threw away his immortality to bring his gf back to life

[0:21:13] TheAsterite: it's like, a couple shots out of an episode
[0:21:21] fromorra: The hooting I've been doing at all the references. The hollering when they mention Kanon.
[0:21:47] Burr11: to be fair i dont know shit about PC98 because that was only in japan
[0:21:50] noodsdood69: I assume they call it Kan*n for copyright reasons?
[0:22:07] Senoquese: ive seen mostly discussion over the screens, how the resolutions and aspect ratios are incorrect, but its real ü§ì talk
[0:22:10] Burr11: no its litreally actual kanon
[0:22:15] fromorra: She says uguu for chrissakes!
[0:22:17] TheAsterite: it's insane you need rights to even mention a brand
[0:22:39] Burr11: oh that's being insanely anal if they're looking at the resolutions in fake cartoon screens as if they're meant to be 1:1 accurate
[0:22:44] phatscout: iirc it's sort of based on the history of aquaplus
[0:22:45] noodsdood69: anime will straight up put Professor Plutonium with a black bar across his eyes for copyright reasons Keepo
[0:23:10] phatscout: i know that parody laws in japan are way more strict than america
[0:23:14] TheAsterite: sigbirdNerdbird
[0:23:22] JTBun: pc98 is a cool style
[0:23:39] noodsdood69: He's the isekai ojii san, but instead of Sega, it's PC98 KEKW

[0:25:29] Burr11: lol

[0:51:32] fromorra: Tamers was good but it had Chiaki Konoka being weird
[0:51:36] Burr11: it's what they call themselves in the press releases when the anime are announced lol
[0:51:52] phatscout: it's "what if digimon became real in a world where digimon was a fictional franchise and shit goes bad"

[1:00:54] phatscout: the fact that every fantasy anime nowadays has the setup of being in a video gamey fantasy world even when it isn't an actual isekai is bizzare
[1:01:07] Burr11: this one isn't video gamey
[1:01:09] rikkaonline: 1st half of usagi is yotsuba as an adopted daughter, 2nd half is time skip and they fall in love with each other

[1:22:45] demon_dandy: Goemon is the samurai dude, jigen is chops guy
[1:22:47] Burr11: the rating is purely just "boo CGI" imo

[1:26:56] Burr11: i loved the trigun remake
[1:27:00] noodsdood69: How'd you feel about Ajin, Ashton?
[1:27:02] Digitalbrother: My heart literally breaks when I see that a thing that I like gets a 3d cgi anime.
[1:27:06] godlessweeb: I will continue to complain about trigun due to the artstyle choices affini2Kermithmm
[1:27:15] horribleham: 3D was never the same after Houseki no Kuni
[1:27:21] noodsdood69: THANK YOU IT WAS A GOOD STORY
[1:27:22] Rotabrutsam: like ex arm?
[1:27:24] TheAsterite: 3d anime? have you seen Earwig and the Witch?
[1:27:28] TheAsterite: henyaZoom
[1:27:29] Burr11: lol ex arm
[1:27:31] MIDNlT: How do you feel about RWBY?
[1:27:37] noodsdood69: Houseki no Kuni is also poggers
[1:27:43] Rotabrutsam: EX ARM USED REAL FOOTAGE OF FIRE
[1:27:45] Digitalbrother: The 3d in Baki 2018 was so bad, they dropped it 12 eps in and went full 2d
[1:27:48] Burr11: Knights of Sidonia was good 3D and before houseki no kuni
[1:27:51] Senoquese: i love the rwby characters so much but FUCK RWBY

[1:27:54] a_shybot: okay so what about the berserk 3d movies almightyHmm
[1:27:56] Senoquese: what a horrid show
[1:28:01] demon_dandy: I think maybe it being so different to trigun og is my only criticism of trigun stampede
[1:28:07] noodsdood69: Not even volume 8 or whichever one they're on? Still a real UB?
[1:28:10] Burr11: yeah digital polyphony or whatever
[1:28:19] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:28:23] godlessweeb: I heard that Netflix anime Blue Eye Samurai that just came out has good 3D, tempted to try it
[1:28:25] noodsdood69: Berserk 2008 KEKW
[1:28:39] ReyJaggy: Its a prequel?! Weird
[1:28:45] Rotabrutsam: they removed milly
[1:28:49] fromorra: I still find 3D hit and miss. Some are amazing (Houseki), but there are also some where I appreciate it but I can't get used to it, and I had that with Trigun
[1:29:02] a_shybot: ooh ashton are you excited for mf ghost? almightyWICKED
[1:29:04] horribleham: "I could go into detail" she says after going into detail ashton51Omegalul
[1:29:07] MIDNlT: blue eye samurai blew me away plot wise and action wise. 3d not as much but not terrible.
[1:29:14] noodsdood69: btw if y'all've never read Houseki no Kuni, it sure does GO PLACES.
[1:29:17] Burr11: Beastars is also another great studio orange one but people dont watch because "Ew furries" so they're missing out

[1:29:55] a_shybot: we love tummy tuesday ashybo1Yay
[1:29:55] phatscout: wait is it tummy day?
[1:29:56] demon_dandy: I have a difficult take with 3d thatd take a lot more time about it being a lil toxic to development of art within anime production BUT thats different to disliking anime
[1:29:57] JTBun: YEAHHHH
[1:29:59] fromorra: It looks good! It was a good show! I just always associate Trigun with that kinda janky turn of the millenium style!

[1:30:13] behoimii: clauviOgey
[1:30:22] Digitalbrother: I feel that Japan and the west both have their strong sides. Japan can do amazing 2D animation, while west can do 3dcgi shows that are watchable.
[1:30:24] MIDNlT: beastars is so good you don't even know it's 3d
[1:30:25] noodsdood69: Y'all not realizing that peach day was the other day and now it's tummy day KEKW

[1:32:35] godlessweeb: "Pig isekai slave girl anime" we're running out of plots
[1:32:38] Navy_Mongoose: the absolute state of the industry
[1:32:41] demon_dandy: its so over...
[1:32:41] horribleham: Isekai authors when told they need to stop adding slaver to everything ashton51Dentge
[1:32:56] noodsdood69: Where do I know that Yoshitsugu guy from?
[1:33:00] Burr11: LN readers are so weird i cant trust their opinions on anything
[1:33:13] noodsdood69: ah yea, that'll do it
[1:33:26] phatscout: wait so the pig, when he was a dude, was he a "pig otaku", like a train otaku for pigs
[1:33:30] rikkaonline: you only have to explain 2 things: its an isekai, and heres the gimmick
[1:33:32] phatscout: or was he just a regular ass otaku

[1:33:36] noodsdood69: Of the latest wave of Isekai, what other ones have you refused to watch?
[1:33:39] Senoquese: how did that get a bigger rating than ballbuster
[1:33:40] ActionMaverick: Fall 2023 anime Akira is a new one right
[1:33:41] Burr11: no he was not a pig otaku
[1:33:48] a_shybot: just as stupid as the vending machine isekai ashton51Bork
[1:33:50] Burr11: he was just a "pig" in a figurative sense

[1:34:09] MIDNlT: hasn't captain tsubasa been around a while. I guess they feel the nostalgia will carry it. So don't need good animation
[1:34:12] rikkaonline: uguu
[1:34:14] ajvark: just say you're an american who hates soccwer
[1:34:16] Burr11: he's just horny and likes being treated like a loser
[1:34:18] ajvark: it's okay
[1:34:20] Navy_Mongoose: that old ass art style
[1:34:21] noodsdood69: The only Tsubasa I'll enjoy is Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles
[1:34:25] phatscout: like that vending machine isekai, the dude in that was a vending machine otaku who got isekaied intoa  vending machine
[1:34:28] ReyJaggy: Pig liver LN art is so good. I can see why everyone likes it
[1:34:33] Burr11: i dont like the grown up tsubasa designs they look so fucking weird
[1:34:37] phatscout: cowards couldn't even have the pig otaku be an otaku into pigs
[1:34:39] Navy_Mongoose: I have a friend who went to mexico and came back a Tsubasa fan
[1:34:43] noodsdood69: PLEASE give it the Urusei Yatsura treatment

[1:36:50] horribleham: Isn't that the one with the hot headless lady?
[1:36:52] ajvark: @AshtonMarten i agree I checked out DRRR on hulu during covid and i dropped it after one episode
[1:36:57] godlessweeb: Baccano is the superior Durarara
[1:37:00] rikkaonline: the vibes of the show were neat on a surface level
[1:37:00] ajvark: but i got into Mob PSycho after it
[1:37:20] noodsdood69: Get Ready! Wake your psyche up up!
[1:37:27] demon_dandy: I have a special place in my heart for the vibe of drrr ashton51Tehe i still like s1

[1:37:30] fromorra: I've been meaning to finish Durarara for years but I'm still mad they never made more Baccano
[1:37:43] Burr11: Frieren is the superior Durarara
[1:37:49] ajvark: Baccano and DRRR are stories with ADHD, that's what they have in common
[1:38:01] noodsdood69: I won't lie, it is a little stupid, but it's also pretty good.
[1:38:08] noodsdood69: I'm excited for part two
[1:38:20] godlessweeb: Narita also did Baccano is why
[1:38:21] Returner7: I seem to remember DRRR kinda being not good during S2???
[1:38:42] rikkaonline: yeah if it was just one season itd be a lot better
[1:38:52] rikkaonline: s2 was just like more of the same
[1:38:52] Returner7: also don't forget your VROOM VROOM!! ashton51Baby
[1:38:54] phatscout: ashton thinkson
[1:38:58] rikkaonline: same
[1:39:02] noodsdood69: The "Something big is about to happen" vibe that lasts forever, a lot like the "A Certain" series, except those give you pay offs throughout the seasons.
[1:39:08] ReyJaggy: Light novel reader :" you had to read the LN" its so much better ashton51Tensai"
[1:39:14] Digitalbrother: Worst thing about Durarara sequels was that I didn't remeber who was who in the 50 people cast
[1:39:26] Returner7: Midnitt requested!
[1:39:31] noodsdood69: It was Midniit
[1:39:38] fromorra: I remember hearing that the second season was really weak but you needed to power through it to get to the third which was good again
[1:39:39] leftenantsalt: Varona is hot

[1:40:53] ajvark: Kekkai Sensen was a letdown from Trigun, imo

[1:50:39] Digitalbrother: Dr. Stone kinda takes an unintentional dig at those isekai where a modern day neet goes to the dark ages, and somehow manages to get technology going. You literally need to be a unbelievable super genius to reinvent technology

[1:52:21] ReyJaggy: araragi flcl
[1:52:21] demon_dandy: ashton51Smile
[1:52:26] noodsdood69: WHERE ARE THE GUITARS AND THE VESPAS AND THE IRONS?
[1:52:30] noodsdood69: THIS IS CRINGE
[1:52:30] godlessweeb: Fooly cooly with a generic artstyle, awesome exactly what everyone wantex
[1:52:30] JTBun: it's the same idea with different caracters
[1:52:46] Burr11: the fuck do we need the same idea again for
[1:52:52] phatscout: They've made four of these and flcl sequels and only one of them amounted to "alright I guess" (Alternative)
[1:52:56] JTBun: the Original FLCL dub is great tho
[1:52:57] Navy_Mongoose: FLCL Dub>Sub
[1:53:02] demon_dandy: adult swim do be playiin infinite flcl reruns LMAO
[1:53:16] Navy_Mongoose: fanservice
[1:53:19] horribleham: yippie, a less interesting version of the landmark anime!
[1:53:19] JTBun: this is adifferent universe
[1:53:24] Navy_Mongoose: ugh
[1:53:25] godlessweeb: FLCL had a definitive ending
[1:53:27] demon_dandy: I mean its about a lot of shit
[1:53:29] Burr11: you thought the original didnt have sexual energy?
[1:53:31] ajvark: @AshtonMarten idk if you know but the male lead is dubbed by Jesse Nowack; shout-outs to trans rights
[1:53:32] Returner7: MAX?!?!?!
[1:53:47] dax812: She sounded like Ashton when she said that line
[1:53:51] ajvark: you ever watch pokemon bridged?
[1:54:01] Navy_Mongoose: FLCL was experimental, the sequels are derivative and nostalgia bait
[1:54:08] ReyJaggy: this is just retirement money for the pillows
[1:54:09] Senoquese: LMAO
[1:54:09] phatscout: They made four of these sequels seasons and most of them were bad, the best ended up at "alright but unnecessary" (alternative)
[1:54:23] dax812: Hearing the announcer say: "Foowly coowly" was bad
[1:54:28] demon_dandy: It was gainax ashton51Tehe
[1:54:28] horribleham: @Navy_Mongoose exactly, it's so crazy to see
[1:54:31] Navy_Mongoose: it was both gainax and IG
[1:54:33] ajvark: gainax/IG together, IG only on the sequels
[1:54:36] noodsdood69: Straight up never watched Progressive or the other one, didn't even know they made a fourth, and now they're apparently on a fifth
[1:54:49] phatscout: Gainax did the original, IG swooped in and bought the rights after the gainax bankruptcy
[1:54:49] Burr11: lol
[1:54:54] JTBun: All of the different serises of FLCL are the same permeance, just different timelines/universes, and some of the same characters
[1:54:56] Burr11: yeah
[1:54:57] horribleham: LOL
[1:54:58] ReyJaggy: fourth one has only 3 episodes

[1:55:16] Burr11: yeah more of a puberty thing
[1:55:16] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, where TTGL was incredible, Franxx was trying to ape it
[1:55:19] Burr11: this is too overt
[1:55:24] godlessweeb: You're remembering right
[1:55:28] demon_dandy: It was very fanservicey but not like the text

[2:21:41] SeafoamReign: sometimes its a rough four hours on some anime
[2:21:44] Navy_Mongoose: week to week is so satisying. I miss Jojo's fridays with the boys

[2:54:02] ReyJaggy: always has been
[2:54:20] noodsdood69: I'm tainted at this point, so any anime with a guy only cast makes me think the studio is trying to make the next Yuri on Ice
[2:54:26] demon_dandy: They were in the 12 fps dimension at the start so maybe its good talent but eh anime
[2:54:40] Senoquese: ive never thought youd be such a hater to say "i hate when people arent ashamed" LMAOO
[2:54:48] Burr11: hmm..

[2:55:26] Kitkattack: sounds like an odd stage performance empathy thing
[2:55:37] Navy_Mongoose: I think it's hard considering there's very clearly a market for what are essentially clowns
[2:55:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: THIS IS WHY I NEVER WATCHED HIGHSCHOOL MUSICAL
[2:55:41] Returner7: yeah idk i don't really get it, except for watamote, it's too cringe
[2:55:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: That shit was so cringe
[2:55:46] Digitalbrother: Well if everyone felt that way, we wouldn't have entertainment. Someone has to take the bullet and perform
[2:55:47] Burr11: what about being in a room of people that are confessing things
[2:55:53] Navy_Mongoose: oh, that ONE really famous Queen song?
[2:55:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ALSO why i hated flashmobs

[3:16:30] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[3:16:34] SurroundedByPerverts: He dates two of them at once, the blonde wants him for herself, and Shino wants him to be loyal to the original girl.
[3:16:36] noodsdood69: A guy with a bunch of girlfriends? Nisekoi moment Kappa

[3:17:25] noodsdood69: Most serious girl being the h0rniest? Sounds like someone really liked Shimoseka: A world without Naughty Jokes :)
[3:17:30] Burr11: She isn't tsundere
[3:17:33] SurroundedByPerverts: Shino is my favourite because I‚Äôm a sucker for the matchmakers who have feelings for one of the people they're trying to help.
[3:17:53] Digitalbrother: The OVA section has a few anime too, like Pluto, Scott Pilgrim, and such. Basically Netflix stuff.
[3:17:54] Kitkattack: that's one of the reason I really like Nozomi Tojo

[3:20:10] phatscout: or no this is something else
[3:20:21] ReyJaggy: or based on korean web novel
[3:20:22] Returner7: for the record my name is a Final Fantasy reference not an anime reference
[3:20:32] noodsdood69: It's so funny how many of the manga and manhwa I was reading got anime
[3:20:43] Senoquese: they made an anime based on one of your mods?? thats so cool ashy ashton51Pog
[3:20:43] noodsdood69: Also, the blue haired character is a boy, jsyk :)
[3:21:00] Burr11: lol
[3:21:05] ReyJaggy: @Returner7 FF VI best
[3:21:14] noodsdood69: You know, I know, but I have to clarify for the rest of chat :)
[3:21:15] SurroundedByPerverts: Cheating does not carry as much of a penalty over there as drug use.
[3:21:20] Returner7: @rey_jaggy ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[3:21:22] demon_dandy: Looks kinda dated if anything
[3:21:25] horribleham: Ashton throwing a bowling ball at the guys again ashton51Omegalul

[3:21:34] Digitalbrother: @surroundedbyperverts or tax evasion
[3:21:39] noodsdood69: Damn, that's a shame, as a reader of that series I'm pretty excited for it.
[3:21:52] demon_dandy: Oh yeahhhh
[3:21:53] ReyJaggy: the web novel for that anime is still ongoing
[3:21:57] Senoquese: LMAO
[3:21:59] Burr11: lol
[3:22:00] Returner7: dammit, I kinda want to watch it because it has my name, but I sorta hate isekai
[3:22:10] noodsdood69: Chapter like 326 or something and still going strong :)
[3:22:15] Burr11: let's gooooo
[3:22:19] Senoquese: @Returner7 if you watch it let us know if its accurate to your life
[3:22:20] ReyJaggy: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:22:22] Burr11: dai dai dai daisuki
[3:22:26] funnyplanet1: oh lord
[3:22:36] InsaneLoke: Not a fan #TBH
[3:22:37] Burr11: i love shizuka
[3:22:37] rikkaonline: i started this one so i could drop it early for being so stupid, but its REALLY endearing
[3:22:44] Returner7: 100 girlfriends anime... idk I'm pretty haremed out even now
[3:22:49] noodsdood69: LOVE TYRANT MOMENT LUL
[3:22:53] rikkaonline: the mc is actually competent and a decent person
[3:22:55] ReyJaggy: i hope they adapt the love confession that is a double spread in later chapters
[3:22:56] demon_dandy: I read the manga a bit but i hear yhe anime is actually kinda poppin ashton51Tehe
[3:22:59] Burr11: lol it is kinda like love tyrant
[3:23:01] InsaneLoke: Yeah it has the same issue as Komi once it gets further on
[3:23:10] Burr11: i like how it breaks the 4th wall
[3:23:14] InsaneLoke: Too many characters
[3:23:19] rikkaonline: the tsundere is a little too tsundere for me
[3:23:27] horribleham: Less choose from and more love at once
[3:23:29] ReyJaggy: this is a gag manga . it will last forever
[3:23:30] rikkaonline: but the third girl is adorable and sad
[3:23:33] InsaneLoke: It is a good art style
[3:23:35] Navy_Mongoose: IT'S NOT LIKE I LIKE YOU???? BAKA-BAKA
[3:23:37] noodsdood69: This is just Love Tyrant with extra steps and less drama
[3:23:39] funnyplanet1: i read part of this manga and thought it was pretty lame but the art is very dopely
[3:23:52] Burr11: shizuka sooo cute ashton51Wibble
[3:23:53] ReyJaggy: All the girls are best girls. Such good designs
[3:24:00] demon_dandy: One by one ashton51Baby
[3:24:00] rikkaonline: hes got a whole lifetime
[3:24:03] Burr11: yeah but it's only the first season gosh
[3:24:15] InsaneLoke: Oh don't worry, there's more and more
[3:24:16] Navy_Mongoose: oh I've read too much Negima, then I learned there were about 40 more volumes to it
[3:24:22] Returner7: too many dai s
[3:24:22] SurroundedByPerverts: @noodsdood69 Love Tyrant was so funny.
[3:24:28] noodsdood69: T R U E
[3:24:31] ReyJaggy: he is at 26 gfs in the manga
[3:24:43] Burr11: that's not the reason lol
[3:24:45] rikkaonline: thats not acutally the reason
[3:24:47] Navy_Mongoose: no, that sounds stupid
[3:24:49] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[3:24:51] Burr11: the reason is just that god fucks up
[3:24:59] noodsdood69: We talked about Kill la Kill and now it's in your recommended LUL
[3:25:24] rikkaonline: those two things arent connected at all plotwise
[3:25:29] Digitalbrother: Heh, Macross Delta
[3:25:30] ReyJaggy: that was just the first chapter of the manga and it never gets brought up again
[3:25:31] Navy_Mongoose: That many that quickly
[3:25:40] Returner7: LMAO
[3:25:44] Burr11: lol true
[3:25:45] InsaneLoke: There's no reason to have been rejected 100 times, someone is bound to say yes
[3:25:52] Digitalbrother: How did he not even land one in 100?
[3:25:52] Navy_Mongoose: There's no way I could have confessed to 100 girls before high school
[3:25:53] leftenantsalt: click the Scott Pilgrim trailer
[3:26:00] demon_dandy: I mean its mostly a gag i think ashton51Tehe
[3:26:08] noodsdood69: It's the playground trope of "I'm going to marry you when we get older" taken to its logical conclusion
[3:26:09] Burr11: there weren't even 100 girls in my school to confess to
[3:26:32] demon_dandy: Maybe 90 of em had boyfriends tsk tsk ashton51Wah
[3:26:38] SurroundedByPerverts: You description of the premise makes it sound like it's overindulgent in giving him good karma, I guess.
[3:26:39] Digitalbrother: Oh yeah Scott Pilgrim is getting an anime (same studio as Devilman Crybaby)
[3:26:41] InsaneLoke: That sounds like a skill issue
[3:26:42] ReyJaggy: no, he just has 100 soulmates not every girl he makes eye contact
[3:26:47] rikkaonline: i think its worth watching at least to the 3rd girl
[3:27:29] rikkaonline: but you are too lol
[3:27:39] Burr11: i dunno they just wanted the symmetry to emphasize how much his luck has changed
[3:27:41] SoundAlerts: Choclad played Quack for 200 Bits!
[3:27:42] demon_dandy: He made up his 100 rejections story, so girls would feel bad for him ashton51Wibble
[3:27:42] rikkaonline: nitpickinh
[3:27:44] rowanfresh: will there be a girl of every type
[3:27:46] InsaneLoke: Yeah they could have just been like "he got rejected a lot" making it 100 also makes a connection that isn't there
[3:27:51] Choclad: Quack
[3:27:53] InsaneLoke: Not a fan
[3:28:07] SurroundedByPerverts: I guess something feels off about reducing 100 people to rewards for someone.
[3:28:19] SurroundedByPerverts: But I've heard the execution is better than that.
[3:28:20] prinnyaxel: i thought that was the premise? that after getting rejected so many times the gods decided to help him out and they screwed up royally?
[3:28:21] rikkaonline: its 100 rejections just so the numbers match
[3:28:27] noodsdood69: Also super dig the squishy art style
[3:28:28] ReyJaggy: not nit picking more like the 100 times rejecting thing was more of a throw away line by the manga author
[3:28:40] Burr11: yes its arbitrary
[3:28:52] rikkaonline: because fake symbolism like that is what anime thrives on
[3:28:56] Burr11: it's just saying ohh man he was so unlucky and now he's really lucky!!
[3:28:59] rowanfresh: polygamy
[3:29:03] Navy_Mongoose: I don't think I could meet 50 girls by the time I reached high school, maybe if he moved every year but even that's a stretch
[3:29:12] noodsdood69: It kind of feels like it was originally a throwaway gag and then the studio decided it was SUPER important to mention
[3:29:24] ReyJaggy: if he didnt have 100 girls the manga would be just kanojo mo kanojo LOL
[3:29:26] Burr11: of course yeah lol
[3:29:50] demon_dandy: She doesnt understand deathly desparate rizz ashton51Tensai
[3:30:08] Burr11: cant believe you skipped the vtuber anime
[3:30:12] Senoquese: YES LMAO

[3:30:43] JTBun: this is the second time this has happened actually LMAO
[3:30:44] SurroundedByPerverts: I see where you‚Äôre coming from, I something rubs me the wrong way about the intradiegetic explanation for the harem in A Certain Magical Index.
[3:30:46] Burr11: it was a bored apes thing
[3:30:47] rowanfresh: blind ape
[3:30:52] InsaneLoke: Blind ape lol
[3:30:59] Navy_Mongoose: so now they can't even see their own jpegs
[3:30:59] Burr11: yeah it happened in 2018 in hong kong too
[3:31:09] Kitkattack: blind or just eye irritation? that's a huge difference in uv exposure
[3:31:10] demon_dandy: Makes it all that harder to funge tbh ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[3:31:16] InsaneLoke: Blindness straight up
[3:31:20] rowanfresh: vision board ape
[3:31:25] noodsdood69: Konyaku Haki looks really good IMO
[3:31:30] InsaneLoke: Like almost complete blindness

[3:45:18] Digitalbrother: Japan did it too IIRC.

[3:45:35] Senoquese: @horribleham LMAOOOOOO
[3:45:43] ReyJaggy: it s a Novel, then an LN then manga
[3:45:47] noodsdood69: I mean, being castrated would make you beefier, since all of the testosterone would go to muscle development instead, making them better bodyguards.
[3:45:58] rowanfresh: eununk = eunuch hunk = eunimbo = eunuch himbo
[3:46:02] Burr11: cant believe you spoiled this incredible anime for me already
[3:46:13] Digitalbrother: @noodsdood69 I wouldn't guard the dude that took my Lil fellas
[3:46:21] Burr11: how the heck would he not be a eunuch anyway
[3:46:22] demon_dandy: Its just possible ashton51Tensai
[3:46:33] rikkaonline: where do you think testosterone is produced
[3:46:43] noodsdood69: You wouldn't be attached to your little fellas in the first place, in ancient china they Castrate you at age like 6 or 7
[3:46:55] Senoquese: LOL
[3:46:57] rikkaonline: its in the name
[3:46:57] noodsdood69: Pituitary, innit?

[3:48:48] Senoquese: you always come back to these "this is the last song i promise" and they are never true
[3:48:52] rikkaonline: according to wiki, in china eunuch lost all of it
[3:49:31] JTBun: !jump
[3:49:33] demon_dandy: Weird girl rizz tbh
[3:49:34] noodsdood69: It would appear I had it exactly backwards, they don't become beefy because of no balle making more testosterone, they get beefy because lack of testosterone makes them chunky, they're beefy but not strong. Oopsies, teehee, spreading misinformation on the internet :)
[3:49:38] horribleham: !bomb
[3:49:41] Burr11: he loves her because she's the only one that isn't fawning all over him.. it's more interesting

[3:51:01] noodsdood69: But consider, from any mans perspective, "WOW, a women, that's super neat."
[3:51:15] horribleham: Ashton. EVERY girl is a cute girl.
[3:51:26] noodsdood69: Excited for season two of Magus' Bride
[3:51:28] Burr11: it makes sense haha
[3:51:29] SurroundedByPerverts: "What do you see in her?" basically.

[3:54:37] Burr11: well.. this season doesn't have much interaction between them so i wouldn't recommend it for the romance aspect
[3:54:42] demon_dandy: Yeahhh but not reallyyyy but yeah
[3:54:47] noodsdood69: She says a lot of stuff in her monologues that she ends up doing the opposite of because she was lying to herself
[3:54:49] Navy_Mongoose: from what I've heard, yeah. she's basically MC's mom
[3:55:04] Navy_Mongoose: mom in the cook and clean for him ways
