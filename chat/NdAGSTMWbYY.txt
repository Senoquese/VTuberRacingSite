[1:11:14] horribleham: @AbigailCrocM JFK was a suicide
[1:11:17] demon_dandy: The correct answer is the matrix theory
[1:11:18] AbigailCrocM: mountains are actually stumps of ancient giant mega trees
[1:11:20] c_v_catullus16: @mrp0p1nfr3sh There's genuinely a conspiracy going on with the Twitch staff against vtubers.
[1:11:24] AbigailCrocM: @horribleham big brained....
[1:11:27] Malictory: My theory is that Ashton is an alien, not a race queen:3
[1:11:31] rikkaonline: repetition of even obviously false facts will make them seem more plausible
[1:11:39] demon_dandy: You said yourself that you believe we are in a matrix
[1:11:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Can we make a conspiracy theory presentation and you open them and just read through it and let us know if its something you could believe it or its fake
[1:11:56] Navy_Mongoose: I believe everything Trevor Moore said, RIP
[1:11:56] yojamjam: ok new conspiracy i kind of like is cia made bitcoin. not believing but i think it's funny

[1:12:25] cakeswindle: Writes the matrix movie accidentally word for word during a pre-game yap
[1:12:26] horribleham: The moon landing was FAKED because we KNOW it's made of cheese and I didn't see ANY cheese in that video!!!!
[1:12:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the CIA owns a lot of bitcoin so... yes?
[1:12:31] c_v_catullus16: The Matrix is an isekai.
[1:13:01] ShinRyuful: ashton51Smile my name jeff
[1:13:09] AbigailCrocM: Wallace and Gromit is found footage
[1:13:10] Navy_Mongoose: the moon landing was real because we  have literal mines of cheese that we can't get rid of
[1:13:24] c_v_catullus16: Retroreflectors on the moon
[1:13:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: actually! this is the best proof @Navy_Mongoose
[1:13:25] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[1:13:26] rikobutepic: The truth is inconvenient when you want to make everyone think you're right
[1:13:30] T33bags: yeah moon landing is real steven spielberg could not direct a fake moon landing
[1:13:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: WE HAVE MOUNTAINS FULL OF CHEESE
[1:14:03] demon_dandy: wasnt the bitcoin guys name something funny like tanaka shika, john doe type shit? ninoegICANT

[1:14:46] Burr11: satoshi nakamoto
[1:15:03] yojamjam: if i was in the cia i would make up so many clever clues
[1:15:04] Senoquese: you have such strong mental strength you would resist spells and addiction to drugs but you would believe the moon landing is fake
[1:15:20] rikkaonline: believing that they would leave obvious hints like that is classic conspiracy theory thinking, real life rarely works that way
[1:15:20] the_ol_regular: Can you sing the Pikmin song Ash?

[1:20:27] JTBun: @Senoquese ashton51Despair
[1:20:49] Senoquese: gotta know everything so you can make your homestuck troll
[1:20:50] TheAsterite: blood type is way more accurate than astrology anyway
[1:20:58] horribleham: Just start lying about when you were born to astrology peeps and see how far you can go.
[1:21:01] ShinRyuful: bloodtypes is cool asf omg
[1:21:08] ShinRyuful: now thats something i can rlly get behind
[1:21:14] Navy_Mongoose: another reason astrology is stupid is that nobody can agree what day Scorpio starts on
[1:21:16] ReyJaggy: i mean its kinda like religion it has no scientific basis and is just like a comfort thing for people
[1:21:20] rikkaonline: giving it value "for fun" only helps validate it

[2:05:42] Burr11: trust me ashton i'll make you a star! *posts 9/11 meme clips of you over and over*
[2:05:47] Kitkattack: your streams are fast and loose so it's like not even any kind off help

[2:06:44] shindigs: respect it
[2:06:54] horribleham: You need to guilt Seno into doing more unpaid labor
[2:06:58] Senoquese: the one thing i feel like would boost u would be shortform content like 10 min vids of ur gameplay
[2:07:05] JTBun: @horribleham grrrr no
[2:07:11] Senoquese: the zelda vid fit you perfectly
[2:07:19] shindigs: i can talk to you about it, but i actually edit all my shorts myself horizontally then the editor makes it vertical and better
