[1:29:01] Burr11: yours was very clearly a joke.. i think all the people rushing to be nude on air just kinda seemed thirst trappy
[1:29:08] TheAsterite: it looks like the most egregious examples were banned for overstepping tbf
[1:29:15] TheAsterite: or rather suspended
[1:29:16] horribleham: I don't think so. Even if it was a problem it's a relatively small problem.
[1:29:23] Returner7: making my opinion know = complaining lol
[1:29:49] Returner7: not scarcasm lol
[1:29:54] the_ol_regular: I dunno, I haven‚Äôt gotten flashed or anything so I can‚Äôt really speak about it
[1:30:03] ReyJaggy: oh yeah i noticed you are always mentioning your point of view helps to quell the weirdos in chat
[1:30:08] barfchan: i love a good whinge
[1:30:11] the_ol_regular: I guess at best what I can say is that Twitch is overstepping
[1:30:14] LapDanceDietrich: im just chilling to my fav content creators, I couldnt care less about the drama on here xd
[1:30:22] Returner7: lol I don't think complaining is bad
[1:30:23] rikkaonline: i think youre really overthinking it. making a joke about something on one platform is totally different from indulging in the act unironically on another
[1:30:35] T33bags: complaining is bad i guess it just has a negative connotation but its totally fine
[1:30:54] DatBoiVLC: no, honestly you holding firm on your line of where your comfortable constantly goes a long way to maintain a healthy chat
[1:30:59] ReyJaggy: i think it does, it invites the discussion but knowing what your take is makes it so chat doesnt go overboard
[1:31:11] JTBun: no I think you are right
[1:31:11] Returner7: you're being good natured about it so I don't think your offending much
[1:31:14] niertlwal: seperation of church and state (of horny)
[1:31:22] LapDanceDietrich: I guess its kinda drama? Its blown out of proportion as of late and that kinda makes it seem like drama to me, but maybe thats just on me
[1:31:34] DatBoiVLC: the only part that bothers me is the fact that this is primarily a 13+ gaming website but rentsyShrug
[1:31:40] mushi_buns: complaining is fun I think ashton51Stare
[1:31:44] JTBun: @DatBoiVLC agreed
[1:31:50] niertlwal: @DatBoiVLC that went off the cliff with gambling
[1:31:52] the_ol_regular: @datboivlc dang
