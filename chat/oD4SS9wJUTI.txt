[1:22:36] mangocast98: deltarune has good music (never played it)
[1:22:43] mangocast98: also there’s sans undertale
[1:22:43] demon_dandy: i kinda get that although for different aspects of undertale
[1:22:45] topical_ointment: megamind
[1:22:45] OzzyIsNeko: @soarerV1 SWEETANGO
[1:22:53] rikkaonline: no meaning to the story if the meaning is "its a story"
[1:23:00] Aefen: deltarune story destroyed by facts and logic
[1:23:03] FriedelSchlintz: and then coconut, orange, lemon, raisins, pomegranate, strawberry. all in S tier
[1:23:10] Superfroakie82: i think my favorite is 4th wall breaks where they’re not actually breaking the fourth wall, they’re breaking a fake fourth wall in the narrative
[1:23:24] topical_ointment: yeah like mango
[1:23:26] SantinoHS: No no delrarune is real! ashton51Wah
[1:23:26] deafmutelaughing: with Deltarune it's meaningful because it seems like you're actually in the right by interfering with the characters
[1:23:30] topical_ointment: its delicious
[1:23:37] SantinoHS: *deltarune
[1:23:40] FriedelSchlintz: i gotta raid&run cause i haven't played the new chapters yet but i hope you have a great time!!!

[1:24:46] demon_dandy: Dont you get sad when your plushie falls off your bed ICANT
[1:24:48] DavidPortnov: Actually, I absolutely agree with you now that I think about it. It's what turned me off of finishing Undertale.
[1:24:50] deafmutelaughing: no I agree, I think it's one of the least interesting aspects of the game
[1:24:51] DatBoiVLC: it's not a focal theme of the game it's more of an ancillary theme
[1:25:00] rikkaonline: D:
[1:25:04] chinfoil: VLC using da words
[1:25:07] Envivii: like it can't be the primary theme cuz it's not compelling enough
[1:25:12] DatBoiVLC: especially in Delta rune
[1:25:35] DavidPortnov: Yeah, and that's also what turned me off the fandom.
[1:25:39] redactedenheim: my cat fell of my bed today and I just laughed at him
[1:25:51] deafmutelaughing: now to be clear, I think the meta-commentary on the genocide route is a bit different than just fourth wall breaking
[1:25:53] DatBoiVLC: undertale is absolutely about human rights first and foremost i think, that's a hot take tho
[1:25:59] DavidPortnov: Maybe I should give Undertale another try.
[1:26:06] topical_ointment: the hear mechanic of bullet dodge undertale within the story aspect is the best part of the game
[1:26:30] topical_ointment: atleast in my little bit of opinion
[1:26:30] Superfroakie82: ashton have you played a lot of visual novels
[1:26:37] DatBoiVLC: "so if I have no free will, am I controlling Mario, or is Mario controlling me? or is the universe controlling Mario through me?"
[1:27:00] Dashy_: 428 Shibuya Scramble is amazing
[1:27:24] OzzyIsNeko: I think something that's just really cool about deltarune is like, it isn't just meta because it is, it's like you are a part of the story, your existence in the story isn't just you're the player it's like you're the player, but your existence as the player is a defined thing, the soul, so you kind of just are like the, like, idk i lost the plot i dont  know how to describe what i want to
[1:27:54] Senoquese: fuckkkkkk i never thought of it like that
[1:27:57] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[1:28:01] rikkaonline: ashton51Noted
[1:28:04] OzzyIsNeko: no im just stupit
[1:28:05] Aefen: LMAO
[1:28:06] topical_ointment: yeah jsut a bit
[1:28:07] OzzyIsNeko: friede14Explode
[1:28:08] deafmutelaughing: it's also why I really don't care for the stuff around Gaster, he's only part of the game in a meta sense for now and it's just like, whatever
[1:28:09] bonatide: Waittttt hes kinda spittin
[1:28:15] DavidPortnov: No, I think we're just trying to understand.
[1:28:23] Dashy_: lets just say it makes YOU part of the story
[1:28:50] demon_dandy: Thats interestingggg i think the gaster stuff is the overdone part ashton51Tehe
[1:29:11] InsaneLoke: zomg
[1:29:21] skele_bruh: all i know about Deltarune is Asgore Truck meme  song jmikeMiser
[1:29:28] Dashy_: Gaster is cool but people try to see him in everything that happens when the whole point is that it "doesnt exist" or affect anything
[1:30:11] Dashy_: Any time anything happens everyone starts talking about Gaster for no reason.
[1:30:37] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: I have no b steak in this,  played none of the games but love the discourse
[1:30:51] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: ashton51Wicked ashton51Tehe
[1:31:03] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:31:21] topical_ointment: yeah dont watch those videos
[1:32:04] Dashy_: corruption arc
[1:32:14] metaconstruct: zomg
[1:32:36] DatBoiVLC: you are actually cooking pretty well here
[1:32:41] Senoquese: uhh friend inside me
[1:32:42] RycegoZ: I wonder if Toby Fox worries his fandom will ever turn against him like they did to the FNAF guy
[1:32:51] JTBun: i have still yet to look into weird route
[1:32:54] eb0ss1: no opinions but i love hearing yours
[1:32:55] deafmutelaughing: I think it's really uncomfortable and don't like thinking about it, which is exactly what it was made to be
[1:33:03] SantinoHS: My opinion on the DR weird route: Gosh thats weird!!! (And spooky!!!)
[1:33:06] Dashy_: I think its really cool, really looking forward where it goes later on and how it interacts with the major story
[1:33:19] Aefen: wow Deltarune sounds way more intensive than undertale
[1:34:15] OzzyIsNeko: ads sadfhasdf
[1:34:24] Envivii: fookin ad wont let me watch ashton
[1:34:31] OzzyIsNeko: @Aefen it is
[1:34:39] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[1:34:46] Senoquese: i do like that in undertale the genocide/pacifist route was very much advertised and seen as the whole point of the game, but in deltarune the weird route is a secret with toby always insisting theres no different endings or paths or choices, fits well with kris and the soul
[1:34:50] SantinoHS: Oh i care about all of it lmao
[1:34:53] Aefen: I haven’t played any Deltarune, I’m waiting for it all to be released
[1:34:53] OzzyIsNeko: @Aefen also i think you mean extensive but yeah
[1:35:14] OzzyIsNeko: @Aefen but then the price will go up friede14Explode
[1:35:16] SantinoHS: What folks are theorizing is interesting. Looking forward to the rest of Toby's game ashton51Love
[1:35:36] JTBun: undertale toby making baby's first game, and deltarune is like his first shot seriously putting his writing and game dev skills to work
[1:35:59] Senoquese: yeeeees
[1:36:05] Senoquese: i like that if its the intention
[1:36:25] deafmutelaughing: I think what this means is that in order to break fate we have to kill gamers (berdly)
[1:37:37] Senoquese: nahh i get it
[1:37:38] chinfoil: you're making sense
[1:38:07] SantinoHS: Personal deltarune theories make more sense in your head. Once you start to put it out there is where things get complicated ashton51Bork
[1:38:08] Senoquese: deltarune being the game toby always wanted to make and undertale just being a step towards that is. so awesome
[1:39:03] DavidPortnov: I think I just got sold on Undertale/Deltarune.
[1:39:56] Senoquese: deltarune last chapter ending taking you back to the start but with the knowledge of everything so you get different choices NOWAYING NOWAYING NOWAYING
[1:39:57] moose_lee_san: I followed;' great insight
[1:39:58] Senoquese: mark my words
[1:40:00] InsaneLoke: game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:40:06] Aefen: I just liked hearing the yapping
[1:40:17] SantinoHS: But thats just a theory...and Ashton theory ashton51Love
[1:40:32] OzzyIsNeko: I think the only way you can make gaster upset with you in some way or like not get given achievements that are like ''things are going well'' is if you get the eggs
[1:40:35] OzzyIsNeko: like the egg rooms
[1:40:46] OzzyIsNeko: so gaster for some reason just doesnt like you getting them
[1:41:00] demon_dandy: I mean i like it as a frustration of a creator
[1:41:00] SantinoHS: The last time I tried to write out a DR theory it fell apart
[1:41:47] Senoquese: speaking of eggs i love that someone found out you can kill the pipis if you hold it for too long like it starts squeaking
[1:42:06] InsaneLoke: what the hell
[1:42:08] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: ashton51Squish ashton51Omegalul ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Love

[1:43:23] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: Things too vast now
[1:43:49] metaconstruct: "deltarune" so close to being an anagram for "la mort de lauteur"
[1:43:51] OwlKnight__wlOvOlw__: 100%and all secrets used to be the way
[1:44:03] Senoquese: LOLLL
[1:44:03] OzzyIsNeko: I think the only reason your theory falls apart is just because I know so much about deltarune that it's like ''but what about that one dialogue where if you do a 488 step requirements list and then go into secret unused room 334 you get wing gaster explaining a random other dialogue from the previous chapter'' and it's like
[1:44:27] demon_dandy: I can never tell if ozzy is fucking with us
