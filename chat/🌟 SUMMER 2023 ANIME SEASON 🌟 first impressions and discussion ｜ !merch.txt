[2:50:05] demon_dandy: You mean like actual quagmire or mushoku quagmire?
[2:50:20] mrvacbob: isnt this series just about rudeus being a gross molestor and girls telling him it's ok and he doesn't need to change
[2:50:24] horribleham: not my kind of beat, but no shame on the chillas who enjoy.
[2:50:52] horribleham: but looks kinda boring to me ashton51Tehe
[2:51:02] demon_dandy: LMAO his third eye opened
[2:51:05] rikkaonline: the anime shows a character maturing and becoming better, but the pov of the show is still from the typical pervert pov and is too sympathetic to him being like that
[2:51:32] FTWOBR2000: No offense to those who enjoy this show. If you like it, that's fine. But this show does NOT AT ALL look like my cup of tea.
[2:51:44] ReyJaggy: oh yeah he still needs to learn empathy at this point
[2:51:46] starchyfriend: it's so fucked up but true when you word it like that ashton51Omegalul
[2:51:56] FTWOBR2000: And frankly I do not feel like having to deal with a bad MC after watching Rent-a-Girlfriend.
[2:52:19] ReyJaggy: From this point he still makes bad choices later on
[2:52:24] rikkaonline: honestly hes mostly a good person, its just sometimes there are specific moments when he reverts
[2:52:28] CastironWhisky: it takes him so long to learn to not be an asshat
[2:52:36] rikkaonline: two steps forward, two steps back
[2:52:50] Returner7: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer

[2:53:30] CastironWhisky: and it is hard to change
[2:53:38] rikkaonline: his progress is too inconsistent
[2:53:49] CastironWhisky: look at Subaru... it takes him forever to learn to not be a douche canoe
[2:54:08] FTWOBR2000: Like, I'm sorry, but if your show opens with your MC being reincarnated as a baby and lusting over somebody breastfeeding him then I'm probably not gonna like it.
[2:54:17] ReyJaggy: authors new book reverted to more comedy
[2:54:18] horribleham: Subaru was like a kid though at least. Isn't this other guy like, older when he dies?
[2:54:25] CastironWhisky: which is why I don't care too much for rezero
[2:54:46] ReyJaggy: @horribleham yeah, like in his 40s and a hikkikomori too
[2:55:01] horribleham: Good lord
[2:55:12] FTWOBR2000: I personally haven't watched a lot of anime. I haven't seen SAO, I haven't seen a lot of harem shows, I haven't seen a lot of isekai, so ü§∑

[2:55:26] ReyJaggy: read this when it was coming out around 2016 is been described that way back then too
[2:55:36] mrvacbob: if you're an anituber where's your incredibly inaccurate fate lore explanation
[2:55:42] CastironWhisky: sometimes its nice to see the tropes from the OG sources too
[2:55:59] Returner7: ok Ashton, 5 minutes till 3 hours!!!
[2:56:02] demon_dandy: I think everything i see about the fantasy stuff in mushoku gets me interested but the isekai stuff doesnt really do it
[2:56:04] Returner7: ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[2:56:35] rikkaonline: @demon_dandy honestly yeah the more they focus on the world rather than his past, the better it is
[2:56:39] mrvacbob: is this spellblades?
[2:56:41] ReyJaggy: @demon_dandy yeah the magic aspect is cool! explains well why he op but no too op compare to other beings in the world

[3:00:10] Zurafruit: YOU PAUSED
[3:00:15] Zurafruit: JUST TO SAY YOU WERE PISSED
[3:00:35] horribleham: I don't want to be a stick in the mud but I am so tired of "Isekai but-" anime. I don't care about the twist hook anymore. "It's isekai but they open a business instead of saving the wor-" I don't care. No more ashton51Pien
