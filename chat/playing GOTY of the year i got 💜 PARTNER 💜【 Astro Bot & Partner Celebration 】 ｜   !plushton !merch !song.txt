[1:34:40] Burr11: its anime you should've seen it alreadyt
[1:34:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: THIS GAME GOT HOMEWORK!?
[1:34:42] xKadejx: o i i a i a o i i i a i
[1:34:59] vtuberacingcorp: You have to start with Hack//Sign, then you can play IMOQ, then you can do Legend of the Twilight
[1:35:01] virtualoop: the first game you should play is infection
[1:35:03] aathray: the OST is nice
[1:35:08] Senoquese: youre gonna give her so much work shes not gonna wanna play it anymore ashton51Omegalul
[1:35:10] Burr11: lol
[1:35:19] virtualoop: IMOQ is the first series, Infection Mutation Outbreak Quarantine
[1:35:25] vtuberacingcorp: Infection Mutation Outbreak and Quarentine.
[1:35:27] vtuberacingcorp: No
[1:35:27] aathray: www
[1:35:28] Burr11: some video game anime are kinda legit though.. like Princess Connect's
[1:35:35] mrp0p1nfr3sh: GAME OVER LMAO
[1:35:39] metaconstruct: ashton51Nightmare
[1:35:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we aint getting shit with this homework
[1:35:51] virtualoop: theyre all like 15 hours each or so, not full games
[1:35:53] vtuberacingcorp: Legend of the Twilight is a manga and an Anime, there's no associated game.
[1:36:04] vtuberacingcorp: It's a sequel to IMOQ
[1:36:09] virtualoop: they get my stamp of approval i fucking LOVE imoq, it nails the old internet forum and mmo aesthetic
[1:36:21] JTBun: ??????
[1:36:21] Burr11: lmaoooo
[1:36:23] mushi_buns: YAA YO
[1:36:24] Burr11: using the hands

[1:36:29] mushi_buns: sim1Steakhead
[1:36:29] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:36:29] vtuberacingcorp: But to be clear, IMOQ is more like 4 discs of the same game. It's not like 200 hours or something.
[1:36:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Blowjob brothers?
[1:36:35] Burr11: she's snapping!
[1:36:42] Senoquese: omg they were so tiny
[1:36:46] Burr11: hahahah
[1:36:56] ZippiBelfast: How scandalous
[1:37:00] Burr11: tiny yaoi paddles
[1:37:01] Senoquese: those werent paddles those were baby pitcrew spoons
[1:37:32] ReyJaggy: Her career is ruined, no one üëâ üëå around my vtuber neighborhood
[1:37:33] demon_dandy: i dont think i heard this
[1:37:35] virtualoop: Ashton if you ever browsed forums during the 2000s to talk about games, IMOQ nails that vibe perfectly, it even has an in-game fake forum
[1:37:49] demon_dandy: classic
[1:37:58] Burr11: you have to have yaoi brain
[1:38:00] aathray: subtext is for cowards
[1:38:07] ReyJaggy: most of us read visual novels!!
[1:38:20] vtuberacingcorp: But what's cool about IMOQ is you watch Sign first, and then that leads directly into the events of IMOQ. Each Disc comes with an accompanying OVA that are occurring concurrently with the Game Disc.
[1:38:30] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:38:37] metaconstruct: i never got into .hack :<
[1:38:44] ZippiBelfast: man bump of chicken is so good

[1:39:11] vtuberacingcorp: It's really fuckin cool tbh. But there's still a lot that's fairly mysterious by the end of the show and the games.
[1:39:11] Burr11: lol

[4:52:53] Senoquese: i think its recency bias since youve just recently played a bunch of platformers, other than mario this has kinda been the only good one in a while
[4:52:57] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah keep up that energy when you hit the mouse level üôÑüôÑ
[4:53:06] T33bags: true
[4:53:11] Noworksm: I mean, the devs have admitted Mario Galaxy was a huge inspiration for this
[4:53:20] Navy_Mongoose: best ongoing game?

[4:54:04] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, PS5 players are starved for games that aren't over-the-shoulder parenting simulators
[4:54:06] Senoquese: if you see it in the context that nintendo has been basically the only one releasing good platformers lately, it makes sense this blew up

[4:54:33] demon_dandy: GAGAGA
[4:54:44] Mononex: Namco could learn from this game if they want to make another Pacman World game. Perhaps Pacman World 4 could have more Namco characters and references.
[4:54:46] JTBun: I think this game or Balatro deserved goty the most out of all of them
