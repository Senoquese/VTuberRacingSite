[0:29:51] ChGuinevere: I have SUCH bad deadlock brain rot
[0:29:52] Returner7: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer WELCOME RAIDERS!!! COME TAKE THE WHEEL!!! ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[0:30:01] ForteGamma: ashton51Stare
[0:30:06] kinkonsito: hiiichilla raiders
[0:30:08] ChGuinevere: Girly i can teach u so much
[0:30:22] Kitkattack: it's a bit more to explain than can be chatted quickly
[0:30:30] niertlwal: there's no real variation for lanes is the thing, just more of what you can rotate easiest to get to
[0:30:30] ForteGamma: Caines has good chicken
[0:30:33] JTBun: lanes in other mobas are important, not so much in deadlock I dont think, might be wrong
[0:30:36] GammaLeo: You've sparked the goober
[0:30:40] ChGuinevere: lanes are blue green and yellow
[0:30:44] ChGuinevere: essentially
[0:30:45] spikebomb5: with moba's each lane has different interplay with how maps are setup, spawns, items etc
[0:30:51] Romblymo: Lanes are like where the minions walk down most of the time
[0:31:05] niertlwal: side lanes can rotate to the powerups easier
[0:31:09] Kitkattack: it's more like a convention for each moba based on mechanics
[0:31:10] niertlwal: and they have access to more boxes
[0:31:12] Kitkattack: on the map
[0:31:16] ChGuinevere: oughh bloodborne... too many good games
[0:31:33] dax812: Where we droppin chillas
[0:31:35] spikebomb5: vs more game knowledge
[0:31:40] JTBun: the thing with other mobas is that certain lanes have designated roles, in deadlock pretty much it's random who goes to which lane, so it doesnt matter
