[0:17:13] JTBun: yeah I feel like you wouldn't like Val
[0:17:18] horribleham: Ashton streamy time!
[0:17:22] Returner7: OG overwatch was definitely a lot of fun for solo queue in the first couple years or soe
[0:17:24] Senoquese: she HATES coordination and tactics
[0:17:27] germanidolgod: Sup
[0:17:30] Returner7: then it became super toxic
[0:17:34] thedidlydoo: @horribleham Thank you for gifting me a sub! XD

[0:18:03] Senoquese: halo is fine because theres respawns
[0:18:22] JTBun: halo is more arcadey, valo is way more competitive and skilled based
[0:18:24] gravitypriest: halo also has the option to do straight up team deathmatch though. no shop mechanics, objectives, or hero abilities
[0:18:29] Returner7: Apex 100% has more interesting movement than the other BRs
[0:19:14] horribleham: Ashton big streamer! Big Streamer need Big Map!
[0:19:17] gravitypriest: sometimes (or all the time) you might just wanna click on heads instead of pushing a payload or w/e the fuck
[0:19:23] demon_dandy: You end up memorizing all the small maps pinpointly
[0:19:28] Senoquese: not defending val or those games but only having one life makes any decision way more difficult and skill based than just "fuck it we ball"
[0:20:02] horribleham: Aston would tear it up in siege. She would get so toxic so fast ashton51Kneel
[0:20:36] lockdown2341: Are we calling Ashton toxic?
[0:20:39] Senoquese: all i know about siege is that theres rick and morty skins ashton51Omega
[0:20:40] demon_dandy: LMAO
[0:20:43] JTBun: Skill in Val and CSGO are based around game sense, reactions, aim, recoil control, etc... there is a lot that goes on in a val game compared to more arcadey stuff like apex or halo
[0:20:46] lockdown2341: Is this pick on Ashton night?
[0:21:01] gravitypriest: waiting patiently for the 25th anniversary quake 3 remake with online lobbies
[0:21:13] ajvark: Ashton play Quake Champions with GetGianni someday?
[0:21:23] JTBun: it's different
[0:21:25] demon_dandy: I think siege/valo types are tough to stream if youre new tho since its one life per round
[0:21:28] JTBun: they all have that
[0:21:31] germanidolgod: Anyone remember those MW2 lobbies? Kids these days would never survive lol
[0:21:51] JTBun: but it's very different game sense and learning recoil is really hard in Val
[0:22:03] ajvark: @AshtonMarten what if you played Quake Champions with Gianni Matragrano and he had some kinda vtuber tournament or something
[0:22:12] Senoquese: apex recoil is really forgiving and more random (afaik) compared to csgo which is both kinda deterministic and REALLY wild at times
[0:22:22] JTBun: @Senoquese correct
[0:22:30] FrostbyteTgressa: Letsa go!
[0:22:32] demon_dandy: Yes ashton51Smile
[0:22:41] ajvark: i think you and Gianni are both very cool and would be great friends :)

[0:47:25] TheAsterite: i thought it was literally where the boulders are coming from lol
[0:47:25] 1redpowern: i hope im not confusing this with another star sorry if i am >.<
[0:47:25] demon_dandy: Just gotta trust scuttlebug ashton51Tehe

[0:48:25] 1redpowern: look up!
[0:48:25] ReyJaggy: speedrun coding
[0:48:25] rikkaonline: its not that easy
[0:48:27] fy_1ceworld: yes the Boba skip was just found in MGS1
[0:48:27] cakeswindle: Like Neo??? Hahahaha

[0:48:29] horribleham: chromu1Bald
[0:48:31] KyuuMJ: No, that's like looking for movie details from a book

[0:48:42] flickmannss: Shoutouts to Simpleflips
[0:48:44] 1redpowern: there it is
[0:48:44] fy_1ceworld: the mgs boba skip saves a crazy amount of time and a boss battle
[0:48:47] 1redpowern: you see it?
[0:48:48] rikkaonline: the code isnt really readable, and you have to logic out a way to exploit it
[0:48:52] Senoquese: theres many things that prevent that, like most games' code being compiled and not readable
[0:48:53] thedidlydoo: No, that would be funny if you could. I took a coding class last year and it is not like that at all.
[0:48:58] 1redpowern: wall bouncing
[0:49:10] Navy_Mongoose: @flickmannss i was watching the vinesauce vid on that today

[0:49:20] 1redpowern: climb on the lanterns
[0:49:25] flickmannss: uncle jobel
[0:49:42] TheAsterite: go to the door at the end of the hallway
[0:49:51] cakeswindle: The game code literally describes the places like "cave with water and red scaffolding" and what the character can do, like "mario wear a hat and can jump. That's coding (expert level)
[0:49:53] Navy_Mongoose: I can tell you how to get that star, BUT FIRST WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT PARALLEL UNIVERSES
[0:50:09] flickmannss: speaking of which did you know there's a Twitch Interactive mod for this game? Where chat can control cheats in real time
[0:50:25] cakeswindle: Pahaha
[0:50:33] flickmannss: this one's perfect imo
[0:50:35] demon_dandy: Coding mario through wall (true) to beat the WR ashton51Tensai
[0:50:35] gravitypriest: you're not gonna get up there that way
[0:50:39] 1redpowern: climb on top of one of the lanterns
[0:50:39] flickmannss: Shoutout to Simpeflips
[0:50:44] 1redpowern: and then you can get up there
[0:50:53] 1redpowern: at least i think thats how that works
[0:50:58] fy_1ceworld: the metal gear boba skip was wild to see all the record holder have to come back and compete
[0:50:59] TheAsterite: go to the end of the rolling rock hallway, toward the door
[0:51:08] gravitypriest: go back to that area where the coins are, then look towards the ceiling to the left
[0:51:16] gravitypriest: w freelook
[0:51:16] 1redpowern: ITS BEEN A WHILE OK ASH?
[0:51:18] Senoquese: ayo i gotta make the ashton mod actually compatible with the twitch integration one then wtf

[3:25:28] KyuuMJ: Exploiting the glitches
[3:25:31] CrumblyBits: So ja k
[3:25:36] CrumblyBits: YAYAYAYAYAHOOO
[3:25:42] cakeswindle: Ahston did a couple of those steps
[3:25:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Hes also playing on a JP cart
[3:25:49] demon_dandy: He skips talking to lakity at the start too TehePelo
[3:25:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the game is slower on the US version
[3:25:54] Senoquese: im sure you could do something like this after a bit of practice
[3:26:02] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten so first we hahoed and then he yayayayayayayahooedd and then he made it in
[3:26:26] TheAsterite: you can try that trick on the infinite stairs
[3:26:27] satanix64: I think a lot of these glitch speedruns only work on actual N64 cartridges and not emulation or ports.
[3:26:28] CrumblyBits: In a more janky version probably
[3:26:28] Senoquese: the BLJ is pretty easy.. everything else? no fucking clue wtf hes doing
[3:26:31] TheAsterite: probably the best place to try it
[3:26:36] Delsin7Pony: it took people years to figure it out, and lots of important stuff took decompiling of the game to find why it works
[3:26:37] demon_dandy: This dude playin apex in mario ashton51Tehe
[3:26:51] cakeswindle: That was fucking INSANE
[3:26:56] CrumblyBits: Its all about the SPEED baybee
[3:27:10] KyuuMJ: Speed running requires perfection
[3:27:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah he gets shot through the wall
[3:27:12] demon_dandy: This is probably the most grinded speedrun game tbf
[3:27:18] BNMotive: and this man also has high quality headphones, what a chad
[3:27:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: and it forces you into his world.
[3:27:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: he break dances
[3:27:37] Navy_Mongoose: Crouch + Punch
[3:27:38] ReyJaggy: low kick mario
[3:27:39] Senoquese: thats the crounch punch
[3:27:42] Senoquese: crouch*
[3:27:43] KyuuMJ: For the flex
[3:27:46] InsaneLoke: Sweep kick
[3:27:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They have different animations in the JP version from what i remember
[3:28:14] rikkaonline: the code is tiny individual actions
[3:28:18] BNMotive: C da matrix
[3:28:25] gravitypriest: it takes a LOT of studying and hacking to reverse engineer a game
[3:28:31] rikkaonline: if the glitches were that visible, they wouldve fixed them before release
[3:28:36] KyuuMJ: Again, consider the mental images people get from reading a book
[3:28:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Hes rotating the camera to change distances
[3:28:58] Senoquese: examining the code in that way would at most just let you know that something is theoretically possible but nothing that tells you how in practice
[3:29:16] cakeswindle: You go into the code and where it says "a room with" etc etc, you just type in "and also a hole in the wall I can wahoo through" and than the code will let you speedrun
[3:29:23] Navy_Mongoose: quit spoiling that
[3:29:35] BNMotive: people sneak through the seams
[3:29:43] rikkaonline: the code is like "copy this memory address to this bank" type instructions
[3:29:49] rikkaonline: gameplay isnt visible
[3:30:03] Navy_Mongoose: your 3d
[3:30:13] demon_dandy: I didnt even know that slide was in the game ashton51Tehe
[3:30:36] demon_dandy: LMAO Mario gangnam stylw
[3:30:39] cakeswindle: Ashton you didn't thank the sub
[3:30:40] KyuuMJ: lol
[3:30:45] satanix64: Imsorrywhat
[3:31:00] Navy_Mongoose: coins
[3:31:02] KyuuMJ: Btw, these levels look like they use solid objects
[3:31:06] KyuuMJ: LOL
[3:31:06] Senoquese: box is funy
[3:31:07] Navy_Mongoose: Bouncy boxes are just for coins
[3:31:07] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[3:31:07] BNMotive: so you learn how they work
[3:31:16] satanix64: I mean there are shortcuts
[3:31:17] KyuuMJ: Every surface in this game is like a sheet of paper
[3:31:18] gravitypriest: when you decompile a game you pretty much have to look at very low-level instructions that have 0 indication of what they are and you need to dig a lot to find out what anything does
[3:31:48] KyuuMJ: Like the Mario 3 exploit
[3:31:53] demon_dandy: Warios ass ashton51Pog
[3:31:59] rikkaonline: its more efficient for cpus to work that way
[3:32:11] KyuuMJ: No, lack of computer resources to work with at the time
[3:32:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: pirating but also because they would essentially fix the game by opening the coding for viewing.
[3:32:17] cakeswindle: Welcome raiders
[3:32:22] Senoquese: old games in consoles like this didnt really have proper engines or languages the way we know them now afaik
[3:32:32] rikkaonline: thats all programming is, taking one layer of simple instructions and writing more complex actions. layers on top of layers
[3:32:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They had the documentation since they had to code the game
[3:32:43] KyuuMJ: Today, we live in a world where programs are gigabytes in size, etc.
[3:32:48] KyuuMJ: Back then no...
[3:32:51] demon_dandy: BRUH the bully got owned
[3:32:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah
[3:32:53] gravitypriest: bc the game is compiled machine code by the time it gets to you so don't really see what the developers see
[3:32:53] rikkaonline: the code doesnt have have human readable text
[3:33:05] rikkaonline: right
[3:33:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: thats also why they have the windows version of this game.
[3:33:19] CrumblyBits: Nintendo Documentors ü§ì
[3:33:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: because they reverse engineered it
[3:33:22] rikkaonline: its not analog
[3:33:49] BNMotive: that jump is hella hard
[3:33:55] KyuuMJ: Reverse engineered and optimized
[3:33:58] demon_dandy: Free star ashton51Pog
[3:34:08] Navy_Mongoose: ever play Super Metroid?
[3:34:15] satanix64: He did pick it up
[3:34:18] cakeswindle: You're world record best chilla and you do that EVERY stream <3
[3:34:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: my friend does speed running and world records for old N64 racing games.
[3:34:24] Senoquese: and even in the reverse engineered version, any flaws youd find were just things that could theoretically be possible, but could be impossible to actually happen in gameplay or have no real applicable spots
[3:34:27] BNMotive: if you ever play Megaman Legends that would make my day
[3:34:37] kawaiicrew4ever: goober‚Ä¶
[3:34:44] satanix64: We're all goofy goobers yeah
[3:34:45] Navy_Mongoose: your the bigger goober
[3:34:54] ReyJaggy: time to get back the record for pole position
[3:35:01] kawaiicrew4ever: he schmovin as hell
[3:35:04] Senoquese: LOL THE TIMER IS JUST KILL
[3:35:06] cakeswindle: Megaman legends awww yeeeee
[3:35:28] cakeswindle: Oh those heckin rabbits
[3:35:31] BNMotive: Megaman Legends has such likeable characters
[3:35:54] satanix64: The rabbit allows you to break the game
[3:35:59] cakeswindle: I'm pretty sure some of this is CHEATING
[3:36:03] KyuuMJ: But yea, imagine building these levels using different pieces of paper
[3:36:10] gravitypriest: dude sleeps with king boo above his bed that's how you know he's hard af
[3:36:24] satanix64: Yeahhh
[3:36:38] CrumblyBits: such a mario fan...
[3:36:41] Navy_Mongoose: Mario is 90% water, so he heals from it
[3:36:44] cakeswindle: An ant???
[3:36:47] Senoquese: i feel like everyone at nintendo knew about that water bug but it just wasnt a priority or big deal to them at all lol
[3:36:47] CrumblyBits: ashton51Kneel
[3:36:56] BNMotive: do you have hamtaro merch in your room?
[3:37:14] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I think they only require that if you sign up to go on certain WR sites
[3:37:14] KyuuMJ: *** has its rules
[3:37:16] kawaiicrew4ever: i love watching osu handcams
[3:37:23] horribleham: Free ashton handcam? ashton51Pog
[3:37:32] KyuuMJ: Oh, speedrun dot com
[3:37:37] kawaiicrew4ever: I WAS HERE ashton51Cheer
[3:37:46] BNMotive: he presses a button with their feet
[3:37:50] Navy_Mongoose: Streamer has a hotkey to mark it
[3:37:51] rikkaonline: i think they use like a foot pedal, or click
[3:38:03] BNMotive: yes
[3:38:04] cakeswindle: He's hitting the button super quick
[3:38:07] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Some World records dont let you emulate
[3:38:13] rikkaonline: yeah, they go back and check the exact time later
[3:38:15] demon_dandy: That was the yayayayahoo jump ashton51Pog
[3:38:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: So hes doing it with a foot pedal
[3:38:17] cakeswindle: In fact it's probably on his controller
[3:38:26] rikkaonline: the timing for each block doesnt matter, only the total
[3:38:35] TheAsterite: after the run is done, they go through the frames with the timestamp
[3:38:49] TheAsterite: pacing
[3:38:49] cakeswindle: I definitely saw Ash do some of this
[3:38:50] rikkaonline: to know where to improve
[3:38:50] Navy_Mongoose: to tell you how fast you're going
[3:38:57] Navy_Mongoose: so you know if you can improve on an area or not
[3:39:00] demon_dandy: Its just for personal reference
[3:39:02] cakeswindle: To see if you're having a good run halfway through
[3:39:04] rikkaonline: they practice each section and know how long it should take
[3:39:04] TheAsterite: no, to know where the run ends
[3:39:06] ReyJaggy: he dried his hands ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[3:39:07] KyuuMJ: the speed runner tool
[3:39:12] mrp0p1nfr3sh: if hes WR no its on N64
[3:39:14] demon_dandy: WOAH
[3:39:23] demon_dandy: LMAOOOO
[3:39:25] rikkaonline: if you have software interacting with the game, thats questionably legit
[3:39:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: but hes playing on a gen 1 JP cartridge
[3:39:27] Delsin7Pony: ashton51Wah ashton51Wah ashton51Wah

[3:40:27] Navy_Mongoose: this is the msot revent WR
[3:40:29] TheAsterite: the run moderators will go through the vid and get the actual run time after he submits it
[3:40:38] kawaiicrew4ever: D:
[3:40:39] cakeswindle: Bcus think of the pressure!!!
[3:40:42] KyuuMJ: They literally play the same game thousands of times to achieve perfection
[3:40:47] TheAsterite: to compensate for human timing error
[3:40:48] Senoquese: yo weezer
[3:40:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: That bottom right video is the karls jobst one isnt it?
[3:41:09] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[3:41:14] gravitypriest: karl jobst videos go hard
[3:41:15] cakeswindle: Like screaming to death like that after all that time trying and the torture of learning the plays
[3:41:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: he breaks it down.
[3:41:19] Navy_Mongoose: 12 days ago
[3:41:22] demon_dandy: Karl jobst is like a breakdown
[3:41:23] Navy_Mongoose: holy frick

[3:42:20] demon_dandy: LMAO seno
[3:42:22] Navy_Mongoose: There's a Goldeneye speedrunner that explained speedrunning in the most depressing way imagineable
[3:42:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: then you try and recreate all perfect pieces into the perfect run.
[3:42:31] KyuuMJ: Again, try to do something to perfection
[3:42:46] cakeswindle: It's like hundreds of thousands of hours doing the same thing over and over in silence
[3:42:46] Senoquese: not the piss monitor again...
[3:42:49] demon_dandy: Cat pee monitor ashton51Squish

[3:48:10] demon_dandy: Or mess around and try find new tech
[3:48:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: there is sure
[3:48:18] KyuuMJ: He could go for the 120 star run
[3:48:24] rikkaonline: until they find a new technique thats even faster
[3:48:26] fy_1ceworld: @cakeswindle lololol i have a hunch youll beat me
[3:48:36] Navy_Mongoose: go for randomizer run
[3:48:41] rikkaonline: tas usually finds new stuff, and then humans manage to do some of them
[3:48:42] TheAsterite: his sum of best is 27, so less than 10 seconds to save
[3:48:43] fy_1ceworld: @cakeswindle also nice ;)
[3:48:44] TheAsterite: for him
[3:48:54] cakeswindle: Everything about speedrunning is soul destroying. Why would someone do it to themselves
[3:49:04] Navy_Mongoose: it's the same video
[3:49:14] Navy_Mongoose: his program updted it when he achieved it
[3:49:23] cakeswindle: 1.25 speed!!!!

[3:50:23] Senoquese: it was worth staying up to see the ending!!!
[3:50:29] demon_dandy: Suigi
[3:50:39] TheAsterite: needed to open the star door
[3:50:49] TheAsterite: so they have a category there
[3:50:53] Navy_Mongoose: @rikkaonline 16 is needed for spawning the rabbit, 16th is required to get past bowser's submarine
[3:51:00] Navy_Mongoose: 15 for rabbit*
[3:51:07] satanix64: I mean Luigi is my favorite Mario character unironically.
