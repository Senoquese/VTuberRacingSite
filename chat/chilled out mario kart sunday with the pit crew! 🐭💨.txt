[0:38:01] Returner7: also maybe you need to set the ram speed to the manufacturer's spec? that can slow down AMD
[0:38:04] JTBun: @JTBman well if it was shipped without any form of shipping protection inside the PC, it more than likely broke during shipping because there was no support

[3:10:39] KyuuMJ: Yesterday, I was at IRL mahjong all day, but I did peek a little bit
[3:10:47] keydget: It could technically be considered a tragedy since 27 people died during the stream
[3:10:52] plazynoodles: the end of the spelling bee was sooo intense
[3:10:54] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:11:22] demon_dandy: Piapi showing up with the hamtaro mask was my highlight
[3:11:23] JTBun: it was!
[3:11:32] keydget: I think you did great. It definitely was a hard call because the contestants also didn't realize how long it could've gone
[3:11:34] KyuuMJ: Time pressure increases risk of mistakes

[3:12:47] plazynoodles: yesss its true
[3:12:47] KyuuMJ: Yep, some guess work happens
[3:12:47] keydget: It killed me when someone was like "Can I get a country of origin?" "No :)"
[3:13:07] KyuuMJ: It's easier to remember spelling patterns than actual words
[3:13:11] plazynoodles: you were a fair host!!
[3:13:14] ChessCatUWU: I'm honestly still super surprised that VTubers were able to do so well considering the joke is usually "English is hard."
[3:13:15] Returner7: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
[3:13:17] hailtheprophet: There's some dude with no name xD
