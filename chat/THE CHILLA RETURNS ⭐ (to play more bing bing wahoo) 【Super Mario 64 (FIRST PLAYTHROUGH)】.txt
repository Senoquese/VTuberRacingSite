[0:35:05] funnyplanet1: monkaS
[0:35:22] T33bags: i mean when mario 64 came out the american games industry was still more focused on pc's since no truly good american console had been released until the xbox
[0:35:26] JTBun: so many boobs
[0:35:32] satanix64: Well this was one of the first games I ever played
[0:36:07] JTBun: american console
[0:36:10] Senoquese: she didnt 100% the mario clock app for the 3ds.. ashton51Kneel
[0:36:12] demon_dandy: Yeah but n64 and ps is japanese
[0:36:17] Navy_Mongoose: Kind of...
[0:36:31] knmpog: bing bing WAHOO!!
[0:36:33] vtuberacingcorp: I wouldn't say it's highly accurate...
[0:36:38] barfchan: sega consoles too
[0:36:42] Navy_Mongoose: The NES dominated the market worldwide
[0:37:05] T33bags: n64 is still a japanese product while it was popular in the us most games has to be apporoved by nintendo (the origin of the seal of approval) so it was harder to be an american developer for these consoles
[0:37:11] satanix64: I'm gonna say it. NES mostly had trash games.
[0:38:00] Senoquese: idk the games were kinda amazing at the time cuz everything else was just like. pong
[0:38:08] knmpog: ur singular toof...
[0:38:12] vtuberacingcorp: The PS1 had a _very_ low barrier of entry in comparison, and we can see today the effects of that with the still big American devs that came up on that console.
[0:38:14] FrostbyteTgressa: The wing cap lasts much longer than the vanish and metal caps do.
[0:38:20] Navy_Mongoose: No, that hat is jusy to get behind that painting
[0:38:30] demon_dandy: Ps1 shovel ware pog ashton51Pog
[0:38:33] vtuberacingcorp: But that doesn't mean the american market was purely focussed on PC...
[0:38:40] T33bags: @Senoquese yeah i still own my n64 and play it to this day no argument about the games lol
[0:38:48] satanix64: It has a puzzle
[0:39:22] satanix64: Static af
[0:39:25] demon_dandy: I think the more evident focus on pc is all the whack ass pc ports of big games

[0:40:25] PrettyPatrickLunchtime: Trolling coffin
[0:40:41] satanix64: I don't think I was ever scared by the piano. Then again I wasn't scared by the Majora's Mask moon either. I think the Skull Kid himself freaked me out way more.
[0:40:57] T33bags: @vtuberacingcorp i mean for sure the market was overwhemlingly for consoles you saw more pc games take off at this time like diablo, doom, quake, starcraft, and half life near the end of the 90s
[0:40:57] Senoquese: but to get a haunted mansion you need a regular mansion to haunt in the first place!
[0:41:26] demon_dandy: LMAO i  feel like you got more scared in  this game than mortuary

[0:45:30] vtuberacingcorp: @T33bags This is somewhat complicated by the fact that Consoles couldn't make satisfactory RTS or FPS games at the time, which are 4/5 of your mentions.
[0:45:47] JTBun: @kawaiicrew4ever sup brother ashton51Love
[0:45:49] satanix64: ngl I always liked the Banjo Kazooie games more than this game (not including Nuts and Bolts of course).
[0:45:55] FrostbyteTgressa: Stay away from the vortex below.
[0:46:05] Senoquese: i cant believe this game ripped off superman 64
[0:46:27] JTBun: horrible game
[0:46:29] Navy_Mongoose: it's fly through the rings, the video game
[0:46:30] satanix64: It's universally regarded as the worst N64 game.
[0:46:34] demon_dandy: @senoquese bruh LMAO
[0:46:36] Senoquese: like half of the game is simply flying through rings with horrible controls
[0:46:40] tsukki_PP: hiiiii ashh
[0:46:46] FrostbyteTgressa: Too close
[0:46:46] Navy_Mongoose: going too fast

[0:46:52] realyatsu: hello.... arthur262HI
[0:47:10] Navy_Mongoose: gop for the red stars, this guy is annoying
[0:47:10] satanix64: Also the ET thing was an Atari game that nearly caused the vieo game crash in the 80s and everyone buried the copies until someone dug them all up decades later.
[0:47:14] Navy_Mongoose: red coins
[0:47:16] DarkSilverW338: Superman 64 is horrible.
[0:47:18] tsukki_PP: thank u for reading the pp part, every one always miss that part
[0:47:30] demon_dandy: Stingrays are like ugly cute af to me
[0:47:36] DarkSilverW338: I never played but could tell from watching
[0:48:05] Senoquese: the perspective with those rings is so weird
[0:48:09] Playmer: Basically Superman 64 is almost uncontrollable and has very tight timings needed for it's early missions. So few people even got past the first level. I didn't when I rented it as a kid
[0:48:29] satanix64: Ironically it isn't actually named Superman 64. It's based off of Superman the Animated Series which is actually a really good show.
[0:48:45] tsukki_PP: yeah thats tru it feel formal even tho it literally pp üò≠üò≠
[0:48:49] demon_dandy: Just add -thaniel or -ster at the end to make it a funny nickname TehePelo
[0:48:49] FrostbyteTgressa: You did well with calling me Tigresse.
[0:49:03] Senoquese: im gonna miss being called senoquese but maybe sen will be for the best

[4:01:38] satanix64: Honestly the art style is made to look so masculine that even the women look more masculine.
[4:01:43] barfchan: lost on the fart maze
[4:01:44] FeatherPentikal: Those are the people that think anything remotely gay is just meant to be funny =/
[4:01:55] Navy_Mongoose: Door is on a ledge in a wall
[4:02:09] demon_dandy: Smelly gasses chromu1Woicrush
[4:02:15] Navy_Mongoose: First person cam to find it (you saw it earlier)
[4:02:23] satanix64: I say it's all just preference.
[4:03:16] satanix64: I'd be hypocritical if I bashed shipping considering I've done it multiple times.
[4:03:23] Navy_Mongoose: I think Mario can kick?
[4:03:30] Niles_Naomi_Sebek: I don't mind shipping, it's vehemently defending to the point of canonizing is my problm
[4:03:54] FeatherPentikal: Yeah, I get the people that think shippers are annoying, but literally just let people have fun; they aren't hurting you
[4:04:05] demon_dandy: There is a rich history in jojo shipping ashton51Kneel

[4:07:26] barfchan: ^
[4:07:28] horribleham: It's really interesting because the history of manga is filled with gay. Fujos kinda saved gundam fr.
[4:07:34] satanix64: I feel like people should just not have a heart attack about it like you said. It's fiction and we all know the difference between fantasy and reality.
