[4:42:23] sausagevt: I LOVE Kirby's adventure on nes
[4:42:33] stormy_halo: the battery could die in gbc game cartridges causing save loss
[4:42:48] JTBun: yes
[4:42:54] demon_dandy: Yeppp
[4:43:00] sausagevt: yeah, it also completely gets rid of the day and night cycle in the old gen 2 pokemon games
[4:43:03] Navy_Mongoose: RIP my Pokemon Gold save
[4:43:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You can backup carts now.
[4:43:05] stormy_halo: my poor pokemon silver
[4:43:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BUT replacing batteries is best
[4:43:09] JTBun: they can be pretty easy to replace
[4:43:26] hydrush__: Hi
[4:43:30] Returner7: yeah old school cartridges use volatile memory, the batteries are only meant to last 10-15 years!
[4:43:32] KyuuAA: Mario flexing
[4:43:33] demon_dandy: ashton51Spin ashton51Spin
[4:43:50] demon_dandy: Better than the psp batteries
[4:43:51] hydrush__: sheeno2Popfox
[4:44:03] Navy_Mongoose: Pokemon GSC battery died much faster, due to always running a clock
[4:44:05] JTBun: eepy
[4:44:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: GO EEPY TIME!
[4:44:08] sausagevt: getting 100 coins in this level is the worst. Like, if the government needed to torture people they could force people to get 100 coins in hazy maze cave
[4:44:12] KyuuAA: 40 stars is a good wrap up
[4:44:22] nq_chickieboo: it's almost 2am for me so I gtg, gn
[4:44:27] demon_dandy: Damn almost 5 hours ashton51Pog time kinda flew
[4:44:47] Navy_Mongoose: You're closer to the end of this game than I've ever gotten meatsHEHE
[4:44:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i think it just auto moves hit it before it hits anything.
[4:45:10] demon_dandy: Platform really went ashton51Wiggly
[4:45:44] stormy_halo: Favorite cap between metal, invisible, wing?
[4:45:51] stormy_halo: so far that is
[4:46:15] sausagevt: Metal marios theme is so funny
[4:46:26] stormy_halo: funny?
[4:46:38] demon_dandy: Its very exciting lmaooo
[4:46:48] sausagevt: yeah, I don't know why I think its funny, it jus sounds really chaotic to me lol
[4:46:58] Dreamdemon1197: So... the new super Mario bros movie. Anyone hyped?
[4:47:00] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[4:47:04] CrumblyBits: i knew that bat was gonna mess u up
[4:47:06] KyuuAA: That was the bat's purpose
[4:47:23] sausagevt: you can literally sum up that game with that sentence "you fucking fucker. fuck. I have to do all that over again"
[4:47:38] stormy_halo: getting batted is part of the game experience!
[4:48:32] KyuuAA: Just cryptic
[4:48:43] stormy_halo: the unwieldy camera is 90% of deaths
[4:48:47] sausagevt: they did pretty okay with what was out at the time. the only other fully 3d platformers that were out was Crash and Bubsy
[4:48:52] demon_dandy: Built differentüò§ (poorly)
[4:49:06] KyuuAA: Nintendo's game design philosophy centers on making people search and discover solutions
[4:49:16] Returner7: nah man the controls are just not modern, that and different design philosophy in the past
[4:49:37] sausagevt: yeah, like a game like super meat boy was intentionally made to be difficult since the controls are so good, where as here mario is kind of stiff and awkward to do precision stuff with
[4:49:41] Dreamdemon1197: The only super Mario games I've played was super Mario bros 2, super Mario bros 3 and super Mario bros partners in time for the ds.
[4:49:53] demon_dandy: Nah some people lack that retroactive thinkin when considering games ashton51Tehe
[4:49:59] Returner7: look below
[4:50:21] KyuuAA: Galaxy 1 and 2 were fun
[4:50:32] demon_dandy: Scuttlegoat the star ashton51Kneel
[4:50:41] Returner7: lol too late, go back to the ddr pad lol
[4:50:42] KyuuAA: Free game
[4:50:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton does crimes
[4:50:47] stormy_halo: wow. based borrowing behavior
[4:50:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Bongo ashton51Bongo ashton51Bongo
[4:50:51] kawaiicrew4ever: scammed
[4:50:56] sausagevt: my issue is that when mario turns he doesn't turn on a dime unless he's turning in the complete opposite direction. if he's turning left or right he has to swing his entire body around and it causes you to walk off ledges
[4:51:09] demon_dandy: ninoegWHATTHE fear
