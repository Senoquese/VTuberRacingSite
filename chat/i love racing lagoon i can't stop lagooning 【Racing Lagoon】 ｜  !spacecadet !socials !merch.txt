[0:22:45] caratecaa: SaGa are jrpgs that are choose your own adventures at the same time. It's great.
[0:22:46] funnyplanet1: in school someone gave me a copy of final fantasy legend 3 which i only found out much later was the localization for saga
[0:22:47] justcerebro: SaGa is a huge series with plenty subseries and I have not played any of them except Unlimited Saga for the PS2 which seems like the single most divisive entry lol

[0:25:25] barfchan: silksong is an illusion of samsara
[0:25:29] demon_dandy: Thats exactly how it felt happened with mvc2

[0:27:00] funnyplanet1: i feel like they wanted to graft tears of the kingdom freedom of approach onto 2d zelda
[0:27:12] barfchan: a traditional zelda would actually be a nice change of pace lmao
[0:27:15] rikkaonline: i think the game will be more "normal" than the video looked; they were probably just focusing on the one item
[0:27:23] Dark_Guthix: @barfchan Agreed.  Reason why I be Pre-ordering it next month.  Pre-order bonus of 6 items.  A pair of shoes and 5 types of seeds x3 of each
[0:27:24] godlessweeb: It looks sorta like Link to the Past where it's mostly linear but you can explore inbetween
[0:27:34] Paperguide: lmao what is the stream title
[0:27:35] caratecaa: 2D/Handheld Zelda series is consistently good so I'll choke hopium. The last one they did (between worlds) is the best one.
[0:27:37] rikkaonline: like the world is going to be built around knowing what items you can summon
[0:27:40] barfchan: @Dark_Guthix ashton51Noted
[0:27:43] yojamjam: we're never getting dungeons again ashton51Despair

[0:30:42] SolAzul42: I watched my brother play through wind waker but I've technically never beaten it myself
[0:30:46] Dark_Guthix: The final boss in Majora's Mask is freakin' hilarious when it's running around and sounds like it's a chicken!!  piapiWheeeeeeeze
[0:30:46] demon_dandy: Thats the 2d one right? ashton51Tehe
[0:30:55] demon_dandy: Or like sidescroller

[0:31:05] barfchan: i just want WWHD on switch ninoegCOPIUM
[0:31:06] yojamjam: i can understand finishing zelda 2 and not playing another zelda game
[0:31:07] demon_dandy: mmmm ashton51Smile
[0:31:15] a_depressed_peanut: mentioned before but have you checked out the night runners demo on steam yet?
[0:31:16] MikeFiro: Ashy was clappin cheeks
[0:31:34] a_depressed_peanut: it's free and super fun
[0:31:34] HungryHonk: the endgame gets insanely fast like endgame Rage Racer but on much harder courses
[0:31:41] Apollo_Neos: the only Zelda game I‚Äôve ever completed was windwaker but only because I helped my younger brother
[0:31:45] MikeFiro: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby

[0:33:15] ActionMaverick: Save da world, my final message DIESOFCHILLA
[0:33:24] rikkaonline: i think the consensus is that oot is the best
[0:33:31] caratecaa: Hey, a link to the past was the best one since I was a kid!
[0:33:38] SolAzul42: Damn ww skipped ashton51Wah
[0:33:42] Dark_Guthix: The only Zelda game that I have never fully beaten (only got up to the very 1st dungeon) was Skyward Sword and I think there was maybe 1-2 Zelda games on the DS/3DS that I haven't played.
[0:33:45] demon_dandy: I think for all my life, link to the past was always the secret best
[0:33:46] moush: true zelda fans always say majoras is the best
[0:33:50] justcerebro: I've never heard anyone say skyward is the best one ashton51Smile
