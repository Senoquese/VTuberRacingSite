[4:30:57] raiifrost: What a song
[4:31:00] TheAsterite: sounds like another shot is needed lol
[4:31:09] ReyJaggy: I think manga is complete for this one
[4:31:11] mrvacbob: it looks like it's for kids
[4:31:25] katsuragi_kakeruvt: this looks kind of goofy

[4:31:53] rikobutepic: how the hell is the trumpet anime at season 3?
[4:31:56] demon_dandy: Shes on her soap box again ashton51Tehe
[4:32:02] Burr11: yeah there is way too many shows we could actually pay animators more if they stopped churning out so much
[4:32:08] godlessweeb: There's thousands of mid anime I feel like 6 people saw but somehow got 3 cours
[4:32:20] ReyJaggy: Oh nvm manga is still on going
[4:32:23] Robert_Brown_: Ad for the LN / manga
[4:32:26] RycegoZ: They ride on top of current trends
[4:32:33] justcerebro: it's insane that yozakura got an anime, that thing has existed for 2+ years in jump and no one even cared, they didn't even try to promote it for the first 2 years
[4:32:42] Robert_Brown_: Maybe the LN / manga market is really hard to stand out itn
[4:32:43] rikobutepic: anime merch is so bad because of it too
[4:32:46] RycegoZ: Man that rain is loud
[4:33:03] Burr11: maybe it's a tax write off?
[4:33:08] InsaneLoke: YOU are watching this
[4:33:11] ReyJaggy: Praying eminence of shadow continues forever
[4:33:15] ReyJaggy: ashton51Happi
[4:33:17] Burr11: what rain?
[4:33:21] Robert_Brown_: Probably the top share of the hits funding the publishers and most projects losing money
[4:33:27] InsaneLoke: i dont think they can write it off like in america
[4:33:39] StreamElements: Up your streaming game with Elgato! From their 4K60 Pro Capture Card to their Stream Deck, I use their products every single stream! Check them out now using my link: https://elgato.sjv.io/AshtonMarten
[4:33:49] Robert_Brown_: yeah and they have the sponsorship model too and production comitees that take ages to make their money back
[4:33:50] rikobutepic: where's the Needy Streamer Overload anime
[4:33:52] rikkaonline: yeah thats it
[4:34:04] Burr11: lmao my friend was telling me that earlier today, Ashton
[4:34:10] Burr11: same exact explanation
[4:34:12] Robert_Brown_: Most books do not sell enough either. It's the publisher model
[4:34:12] rikkaonline: the anime market is so fucked, low wages, absurd dvd prices
[4:34:18] justcerebro: I guess they haven't had any big huge hits since chainsaw man so they'll give anime to anything that survives ashton51Smile
[4:34:18] Burr11: about start ups yes
[4:34:32] godlessweeb: Animator sobbing silently as he draws his 50th isekai harem girl kiss scene of the night (he has 50 more before his break)
[4:34:44] TheAsterite: i thought chainsaw man didn't do well in japan
[4:34:48] rikkaonline: i mean... ill take see what ideas work over nothing but sequels
[4:34:54] rikobutepic: hentai stays winning
[4:34:54] Robert_Brown_: Monogatari probably funded a ton of anime
[4:34:57] raiifrost: I feel like the oversaturation of anime is the downfall for a lot of shows
[4:35:00] justcerebro: the Kagurabachi anime in a year is gonna go insane tho
[4:35:01] Robert_Brown_: indirectly
[4:35:03] InsaneLoke: CSM did NOT do well in bluray sales in JP
[4:35:06] Xuang101: Hi ashton
[4:35:08] SphericalNA: @godlessweeb the 100 girlfriends who really really really really really love you
[4:35:15] rikkaonline: tbh yeah
[4:35:16] Phantom_Chief: even Chainsaw Man wasn't profitable, despite how popular it was.
[4:35:18] InsaneLoke: it sold like 2,000 copies
[4:35:20] Xuang101: Are you nerding out about anime today?
[4:35:24] justcerebro: the CSM anime sucked ass it makes sense that it didn't do well
[4:35:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Dont they only invest in mangas for anime adaptations that hit huge in japan?
[4:35:29] justcerebro: ashton51Smile
[4:35:34] mrp0p1nfr3sh: and they dont really fucking care about foreign nations?
[4:35:50] Xuang101: Can you tell us what an Ashton core anime is?

[4:36:16] garrche: its really just numbers in a computer lmao
[4:36:21] Burr11: it's gonna crash some day yeah
[4:36:22] rikkaonline: hollywood accounting - there doesnt need to be a profit as long as the investors take home a check
[4:36:32] godlessweeb: I'm genuinely shocked Pluto got made in today's anime environment
[4:36:33] justchiken: we're all just numbers in a computer
[4:36:37] JTBun: we're just in the matrix...
[4:36:39] Senoquese: are you really awake
[4:36:40] Robert_Brown_: Worst case just the production comitee gets bankrupt and they write it off taxes
[4:36:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The reason why Venture capitalists invest in startups in the US is because for every 40 businesses that lose money and the 1 that hits hits HUGE. like they get 1000x what they invested total.
[4:36:43] rikkaonline: vc investors extract wealth and leave an empty shell
[4:36:54] Xuang101: You don't understand, Japan has a high production value that whatever weird thing they put out it somehow works out for them
[4:37:06] DatBoiVLC: bold statement coming from a vtuber Kappa
[4:37:17] JTBun: money is fake
[4:37:20] Burr11: the thing right now is with anime streaming taking off so much abroad, studios and streaming services are just throwing money to get as much content as they can as possible.. when anime drops as a fad that money is gonna dry up
[4:37:20] justchiken: spend time at work, get points on card to spend at store, repeat
[4:37:22] ReyJaggy: Ma'am this is a wendys
[4:37:23] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Most money is horded by the 1%
[4:37:29] Phantom_Chief: MAPPA spent a TON of money on the production of CSM, they probably could have used that budget to make 24 episodes if they went for quality Jujutsu Kaisen
[4:37:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: in order for capitalists to keep making profit it can never stop.
[4:37:44] Phantom_Chief: *like
[4:37:47] demon_dandy: I mean the blu ray thing about csm is much more than "they had bad blu ray sales"
[4:37:48] Robert_Brown_: Oh when the music stops it's gonna crash hard
[4:37:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: JJK was already good.
[4:37:57] rikkaonline: it wont stop, theyll just keep making the minimum change needed to keep complete failure at bay while continuing to funnel the money to the top
[4:37:59] InsaneLoke: JJK is their biggest
[4:38:08] InsaneLoke: the new season was crazy sakuga filled
[4:38:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: isnt Spy X family making them bank?
[4:38:21] Senoquese: this is such a deep important conversation for someone who was drunk an hour ago
[4:38:27] Burr11: kyoto animation is the most ethical studio and their stuff looks way better than anything else.. but that's because they PLAN and take their time with shit
[4:38:34] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese this is normal when drinking at least it is for me
[4:38:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Dont most anime studios just close up shop and start anew?
[4:38:51] JTBun: i mean, that's how VC works
[4:38:53] godlessweeb: Money laundering through 13 episode fantasy shonens
[4:38:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: no one really FAILS to fail?
[4:38:58] rikkaonline: they make a company for each anime - that company can operate at a loss, but all the companies they contract get paid
[4:39:05] butwhenwilltheylearn: ?????
[4:39:11] Robert_Brown_: Oh the big companies are trying to buy themselves a monopoly with venture capital.
[4:39:14] Burr11: hibike euphonium season 3 was finished like 6 months ago and is only airing now.. that's how much time they give their animators
[4:39:21] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its like the end of rome

[4:39:47] rikkaonline: when empires fall, it isnt sudden - its a slow decline

[4:39:55] JTBun: you are sdjghjksdghsdghjksdg

[5:58:57] demon_dandy: Cuteeee ashton51Wibble
[5:59:07] GPWil: The problem was that they did races with too many people and had to share time with each of them, making it seem dragged out.
[5:59:10] demon_dandy: Ohhh its a big bird ashton51Pog
[5:59:17] luwudco: furry senses tingling

[6:03:37] Seere_CH: the cinderella girls anime is one of my fav anime of all fucking time
[6:04:04] GPWil: Yeah, I watched the first ones, but the recent ones I kinda can't watch it, their movements looks too inorganic
[6:04:18] Seere_CH: Those are the starting units
[6:04:23] soldarkangel1: Maybe one day 3d can look still kinda 2d in a way But not Shizzy as it is now
[6:04:32] soldarkangel1: Like ninja Kamuai!
[6:04:39] Seere_CH: ASHTON THEY CONFIRMED STRAYLIGHT/NOCT

[6:04:56] Seere_CH: do u want the s2 preview
[6:05:00] Cycle_Mantis: They just barely caught up to RWBY imo. The design and style need to be completely different from 2D that you can't just expect the same things that have always worked

[6:07:30] Cycle_Mantis: @soldarkangel1 I guess it's the advantage of going all-in on 3D and having a unique perspective and backing to make it work as its own thing
