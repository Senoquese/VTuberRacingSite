[7:29:46] sausagevt: is this what the racetrack is like

[7:42:49] barfchan: speckles ichimaiaCry
[7:43:06] barfchan: just standing there... waiting for us
[7:43:15] sausagevt: though that's interesting, because last year I'm pretty sure Aounoma referenced the timeline
[7:44:11] sausagevt: the way I see it, this game takes place SO far into the future that its basically already had its own version of every single game
[7:45:14] sausagevt: like, its so far into the future that the calendar has basically probably reset multiple times and there's probably been like, multiple mass extinction events to the point that it doesn't even matter lol
[7:45:52] barfchan: no 24hr hot pot hampwnPlead
[7:45:53] sausagevt: woah, look how coo the castle looks :< it looks like laputa

[7:49:19] sausagevt: don't you just like, whack it to turn it on?
[7:49:23] Returner7: I can give you a hint

[7:52:54] JorunnaV: @sausagevt (Did some FOB too jorunn1Poggie )
[7:53:02] sausagevt: <3
[7:53:09] sausagevt: Ash was actually in a Zelda game
[7:53:27] noodsdood69: wow, you didn't even use the funny long stick to move things to places where they shouldn't be? BIG props Ash.
[7:54:08] sausagevt: I'm assuming you need a counter weight
[7:54:49] noodsdood69: brain too big, solves puzzles properly instead of going "hehe, lemme just be stimky" doing that requires your brain be flat :)
[7:54:53] sausagevt: I'm sorry, I'm kind of talking out loud and playing the game myself a little in my head. I should leave it to you xD <3
[7:55:32] noodsdood69: BIG upset you can't attach a fan to a shield and make a hoverboard though
[7:56:18] sausagevt: I wonder if there's any gyro puzzles in this
[7:56:40] sausagevt: Hmm..
[7:57:12] noodsdood69: super fond of putting a bomb on a shield and then doing a shield flip to launch yourself in a direction, it almost makes up for Nin10do taking Wind Bombs away from us :)
[7:57:13] sausagevt: opal not too bad
[7:57:31] sausagevt: I know lol, but its so real though, that's def how you'd do it irl lol
[7:58:26] parfaitVT: confirmed the best at fans!
[7:58:28] sausagevt: so I guess that the moment they become attached to the same base they operate in synch automatically
[7:58:41] parfaitVT: SO TRUE
[7:59:12] noodsdood69: so funny that all the Sheikah tech is SIMPLY gone now
[7:59:21] sausagevt: yeah, omg imagine if you had like, a HUGE construct and had to run to both ends and hit both while the battery wasted lol
[7:59:37] Returner7: mom0kiHehe mom0kiHehe mom0kiHehe

[8:02:14] barfchan: i don't think there's a limit
[8:02:18] noodsdood69: surprisingly, in my exploration
[8:02:37] sausagevt: I think so long as theres a ceiling and a roof you can do it, based on what I saw from the demonstration
[8:02:48] MakoFukasame: hey ash how's the zeldors
[8:02:50] noodsdood69: THATS a hinox

[8:05:57] noodsdood69: d'you see they changed how Bullet Time works in this one?
[8:06:26] sausagevt: okay, he just kinda gingerly tossed it at you instead of whacking you with it xD
[8:06:56] sausagevt: no, pretty sure they ddin't. I have no idea what that is

[8:11:09] sausagevt: he's like "ALL RIGHT ALREADY, I GET IT"
[8:11:28] noodsdood69: shocker, a bomb to the eye stuns you for a WHILE
[8:11:34] noodsdood69: Kappa

[8:18:23] InubashiriMomiji95: With a name like Asthon Marten I was wondering if you were gonna be racing themed.
[8:18:37] InubashiriMomiji95: DS2 is still worth playing honestly.
[8:18:40] DreamyEtude: it's very fun if you play with people imo
[8:18:51] InubashiriMomiji95: But it is very clunky compared to the rest
[8:18:57] sausagevt: the air starts getting thinner and link passes out
[8:19:00] DreamyEtude: I've been having a great time just playing with some people from chat!
[8:19:04] noodsdood69: I am HORRIFICALLY bad at racing and fighting games, as well as FPS :)
[8:19:10] noodsdood69: RAURU MY BELOVED
[8:19:12] InubashiriMomiji95: Me and Dreamy are co-op
[8:19:27] noodsdood69: das my right hand man right there :)
[8:19:32] DreamyEtude: I remember I found your stream through Ham Ham heartbreak because it's my faveeee game lol
[8:19:37] InubashiriMomiji95: We're about half way through at this point
[8:20:21] sausagevt: omg this is giving me massive vertigo
[8:20:21] InubashiriMomiji95: If I was to compare it to DS1 we're at the part in the game where you would beat Ornstein and Smough.
[8:20:29] DreamyEtude: I am a huge Hamtaro fan!!
[8:20:34] DreamyEtude: I think I own every hamtaro game lol
[8:20:52] DreamyEtude: I played them as a kid too!
[8:20:54] sausagevt: oh my god this is making my feet numb looking at it lol
[8:21:00] parfaitVT: the hamtaro games are so cute
[8:21:08] sausagevt: yes xD
[8:21:10] sausagevt: I am lol
[8:21:10] noodsdood69: oh yeah speaking of eld surfing and Tony hawk, found out yesterday was his birthdayShi
[8:21:26] InubashiriMomiji95: @DreamyEtude Oh that reminded me. I found Hamtaro ff14 fanart today that I meant to post.
[8:21:31] sausagevt: oh wait its the goat husband
[8:21:49] sausagevt: I mean, he looks like a goat xD
[8:22:17] DreamyEtude: ohhh yeah i love the great fairies! I haven't played TOTK yet but i imagine they're probably in this too
[8:22:43] noodsdood69: LOVE the funny horse Great Fairy, it's a whole vibe
[8:22:47] sausagevt: I'm not crazy about the great fairies form botw. they kinda creep me out xD
[8:23:14] sausagevt: its not even their design its their aggressive affection xD
[8:23:18] noodsdood69: WW great fairies best fairies, no contest
[8:23:39] parfaitVT: yahaha!!
[8:23:42] noodsdood69: GET KOROKED GOOBER
[8:23:43] sausagevt: I remember the great fairies from twilight princess being pretty cool
[8:23:56] skrawtoom: REJECTED! BibleThump
[8:24:09] noodsdood69: Twilight Princess didn't have Great Fairies I thought, just the Light Spirits
[8:24:19] sausagevt: yeah, the ones from ocarina were cool. it was the low polys that made them look kinda weird xD
[8:24:43] sausagevt: no, there were great fairies in twilight princess
[8:25:00] noodsdood69: WW Great fairies are Sinister and have many arms
[8:25:11] noodsdood69: THE ALMIGHTY COMMA
[8:25:13] barfchan: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[8:25:20] barfchan: WHO IS SHE
[8:25:29] barfchan: barfchCREATURA
[8:25:33] sausagevt: she's like "OH NO, GOATS????"
[8:25:36] barfchan: hello sonia barfchMAAM
[8:25:55] sausagevt: "that's cool"
[8:26:13] sausagevt: Okay, so it wasn't Zelda? It was sonia?
[8:26:16] barfchan: she got isekai'd...
[8:26:41] noodsdood69: I mean, Ganon kinda built like a truck, getting hit by him is akin to getting Isekai'd
[8:26:55] sausagevt: WAIT, WHAT IF ZELDA NEVER COMES BACK, AND SHE LIVES IN THE PAST AND MARRIES THE GOAT GUY OR SOMETHING
[8:27:16] parfaitVT: zelda's just having a neat little dream
[8:27:21] sausagevt: AND IT TURNS OUT THE ZELDA WHO FOUNDED HYRULE WAS ACTUALLY BOTW ZELDA
[8:27:47] sausagevt: just a theory, I literally have NO IDEA lol
[8:28:25] noodsdood69: But consider the even funnier answer: Zelda is just how people remember the name Sonia and it's been wrong for GENERATIONS
[8:28:58] sausagevt: oh, I thought you were actually taking my earnest theory seriously, nevermind xD
[8:29:24] noodsdood69: love balloons, they got the funny double double letters
[8:29:51] sausagevt: can you turn into a baby to get inside
[8:29:52] noodsdood69: need a chasis dontcha?
[8:30:38] sausagevt: its really neat how they give you all your abilities really early in the game
[8:30:55] TRCGstream: oh dang your still going
[8:31:04] barfchan: ashton51Omegalul
[8:31:07] sausagevt: omg lol
[8:31:21] sausagevt: trial and error lol
[8:31:22] barfchan: just... one more shrine..... meatsLSR
[8:31:33] noodsdood69: question: What's stopping you from attaching a balloon to the heat source?
[8:31:47] sausagevt: hmm
[8:32:15] noodsdood69: and THATS why you have three torches :)
[8:32:19] sausagevt: you so smart <3
[8:32:33] noodsdood69: I mean, you still need a chasis, it's just a chasis for YOU rather than the balloon :)
[8:32:56] sausagevt: good job :3
[8:33:00] sausagevt: so smart
[8:33:02] sausagevt: ash so smart
[8:33:38] noodsdood69: putting the cart before the horse, are we :)
[8:34:05] sausagevt: "now fight 10 lionels"
[8:34:51] noodsdood69: as with all GOOD puzzle games, first there's learning of concept, followed by proof of concept, and then extrapolation of concept (How to apply it in various bizarre situations)
[8:35:44] sausagevt: omg that's so annoying lol
[8:35:57] noodsdood69: mmm, ball glue
[8:36:14] sausagevt: ash so smart heheheh
[8:36:40] noodsdood69: it's like those ringing balls you roll in your hand :)
[8:36:48] noodsdood69: big ball is for TREASURE, my beloved
[8:36:55] sausagevt: that's gonna be so annoying to get up there lol
[8:37:23] noodsdood69: uppies :)
[8:37:51] sausagevt: damn they really do think of everything
[8:38:15] noodsdood69: AND, even if you still couldn't reach it, you could've just hit them with the TOTK Stasis
[8:38:35] barfchan: skillfully
[8:38:37] noodsdood69: using the funny glue ability
[8:38:38] sausagevt: uhhh lol
[8:39:05] sausagevt: oh, okay nevermind its not as troublesome as I thought it'd be xD
[8:39:06] noodsdood69: it's..... "HAND" y? :)
[8:39:30] noodsdood69: love attaching those fire spitters to shields, very amusing :)
[8:39:46] sausagevt: Links like "this is so annoying why do I have to do all of this"\
[8:40:11] barfchan: ashton51Wah
[8:40:28] barfchan: GAMER
[8:40:34] sausagevt: that is so bizarre looking lol
[8:40:35] noodsdood69: WE HAVE LIFTOFF
[8:41:00] noodsdood69: time to hustle and jive the ball :)
[8:41:26] sausagevt: "good job link, here's a travellers sword, now go away"
[8:41:36] barfchan: we're rich!
[8:41:46] noodsdood69: Thanks for the big ball, here's a cool rock, get out of my sight
[8:41:51] barfchan: one billion zelda bucks
[8:42:08] noodsdood69: I mean, worst comes to worst, there's a statue in the great Plateau
[8:42:20] sausagevt: isn't it like, 5 am for you lol
