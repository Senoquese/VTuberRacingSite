[1:00:00] demon_dandy: porridge is kinda the goat
[1:00:00] niertlwal: very good, helps to skip breakfast
[1:00:04] PastaThief911: one of my friends talks about flattening fetish people as a joke a little too much. I'm kinda getting sus of him
[1:00:06] Kitkattack: like every time they'd rather get a slice of pizza or mickeyd's rather that something i whipped up DansGame
[1:00:08] niertlwal: i love my mushy paste
[1:00:12] niertlwal: it's like eating glue

[1:00:57] PastaThief911: flattening fetish as in the looney toons thing. like they get crushed by an anvil or steam roller
[1:01:06] niertlwal: i remember making a cursed cup of oats with PB and hot sauce too
[1:01:06] demon_dandy: that flattening friend eating good in the lastest CSM ep ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:01:36] Senoquese: i KNEW this stream was cursed to be just fetish talk

[1:02:24] SirSour539: TBF hylics is weird enough that fetish talk while playing it seems normal
[1:02:33] demon_dandy: yoyo hungry ashton51Baby
[1:03:08] NozomeAkimoto: May your gland endure 1000 years!
[1:03:26] niertlwal: ok back to work for me

[1:04:12] HungryHonk: it takes like a year to develop the content creator commentating skills if streaming a lot, that's what i meant
[1:04:28] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog the glizzyyyy
[1:04:40] HungryHonk: yeah you were way more awkward a few months ago
[1:04:49] teawithtrixie: that was definitely an item use animation

[1:05:11] behoimii: sick chinchilla visual1Nice
[1:05:15] Kitkattack: Ashton gobblin glizzys ashton51Pog
[1:05:22] HungryHonk: i have spent the last few months redesigning how suspension and tire traction works 3 different times
[1:05:34] Senoquese: ashton was born to be a great vtuber, she even has "vtuber" in her suit and thats a permanent part of her.. most of the time
[1:06:03] SirSour539: wayne is such a hunk of a man
[1:06:20] behoimii: all of the suit is just a huge birth mark
[1:06:24] nautacon: he is built different
[1:06:28] nautacon: he's built wrong LUL
[1:06:42] SirSour539: hylics 2 is personally my fav
[1:06:49] Senoquese: that wussy is totally worth the craziness
[1:07:04] demon_dandy: yeah i watched 2 ashton51Tehe
[1:07:06] NozomeAkimoto: At least he's clay, so you can definitively say he's built
[1:07:14] SirSour539: 2 feels like more of a game than a concept
[1:07:56] SirSour539: this speaks a lot on the human condition or smth
[1:07:59] HyperVirtualExtreme: hyperv13SenkoComfy
[1:08:11] nautacon: from the back it almost looks like he dabs when running
[1:09:19] JTBun: RICH

[1:09:30] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog *points at big blood splatter* das you!!
[1:09:40] Senoquese: rick and morty talks about the human condition? nobody cares. indie game talks about human condition? 10/10 goty üôÑ
[1:09:41] Kitkattack: yoinky spoloinky???
[1:10:10] demon_dandy: bruh that stare into the sky
[1:10:23] HungryHonk: rick and morty is a battle between dan harmon trying to talk about his extremist politics and justin roiland trying to tell poop jokes
[1:10:29] HungryHonk: together they write... something
[1:10:33] demon_dandy: shindigsZooted
[1:10:38] NozomeAkimoto: Every game and piece of media talks about the human condition, if you think about it
[1:10:50] Senoquese: almost every single rick and morty episode has been about incest this season, does that count as human condition?
[1:11:12] PastaThief911: also plenty of incest plot points in rick and morty
[1:11:32] PastaThief911: and more recently they did selfcest
[1:11:50] demon_dandy: rick was in fortnite so that says something about the human condition ashton51Kneel
[1:12:01] nautacon: where can I find inhuman games to escape the weakness of flesh and human condition MrDestructoid
[1:12:09] teawithtrixie: @HungryHonk I think this is the best description of the show there has been for a while. With the addition of "the board of writers barely disguised fetish"
[1:12:32] SirSour539: goku and rick hittin' the giddy in fortnite speaks on the human conditoin
[1:12:40] nautacon: the sister keeps peeing herself
[1:12:40] JTBun: probably
[1:12:40] SirSour539: griddy*
[1:12:41] demon_dandy: incest ashton51Tehe
[1:12:50] teawithtrixie: early seasons had a lot of pee stuff too
[1:12:51] PastaThief911: it's gotta be a fetish thing. they've done it too many times for it not to
[1:13:00] PastaThief911: then they made a gaint incest space baby
[1:13:17] Senoquese: an incest joke here or there? thats *fine*. but multiple episodes? it just HAS to be a fetish
[1:13:21] JTBun: lmao
[1:13:37] teawithtrixie: yeah xD basically the seasons have like, a tone where you can guess which writer had their turn with the fetish pencil
[1:13:42] demon_dandy: it reaaaally depends how they portray it, you just know ashton51Tehe
[1:13:45] JTBun: PAPER CUP ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:14:19] PastaThief911: even with the incest stuff every season I wanna see season 6
[1:14:20] SirSour539: BUT RICK AND MORTY MAKES ME FEEL SMART D:
[1:14:28] JTBun: I have never wanted to watch Rick and Morty
[1:14:33] Senoquese: i am hatewatching it at this point lool
[1:14:44] nautacon: the "overly detailed feet" artists, or another type?
[1:15:10] HungryHonk: anime does fetish stuff to have horny content without getting stopped by laws forbidding normal lewd content on tv
[1:15:30] NozomeAkimoto: Super detailed tongues also are very telling about the artist
[1:15:50] cannibism: go for it nakamura?
[1:16:01] nautacon: this is why we stick with wholesome yaoi hands
[1:16:11] Senoquese: i cant wait for the armpit section in the next playchilla
[1:16:18] HungryHonk: elfen lied is my favourite manga but it had the worst anime adaptation ever because there wasn't enough episodes to tell the story so the author just made them animate all the fetish content and skip everything else
[1:16:41] SirSour539: It's fun to think that the weird fetish stuff in japan predates WWII
[1:17:22] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:17:43] cannibism: maybe its the rumiko takahashi artstyle
[1:18:29] SirSour539: If you get it, you get it
[1:18:41] NozomeAkimoto: It's a sign that is too late, you're in too deep
[1:18:54] Senoquese: i mock ashton for her streams always being about kinks while simultaneously always making ashton go on kink tangents ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[1:18:57] monoristi: yooo I'm gonna look this artist up :)
[1:18:59] teawithtrixie: also with fetishizing BL bodies, people look *wildly* different depending on like, if its a Straight Woman or a Gay Man drawing it? Like there are just very strong trends
[1:19:14] Kitkattack: good lord
[1:19:22] HungryHonk: ive heard marine hololive draws fetish porn of herself under an alias
[1:19:47] HungryHonk: hololive contracts very strict
[1:19:53] HungryHonk: see: gura and her other persona she still uses
[1:19:56] NozomeAkimoto: yaoi hands are, well...
[1:20:09] demon_dandy: i mean the artist of the momcon manga ueshiba has a super cute style but their actual text is crazy
[1:20:20] SirSour539: it always seems like it's the most mundane things that are just... off...
[1:20:32] SirSour539: like the armpit has too much detail
[1:21:07] demon_dandy: ookumo flashback
[1:21:16] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[1:21:30] Senoquese: im sorry for derailing this stream by talking about incest ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:21:34] nautacon: I thought this was an educational stream. There was a game too??
[1:21:44] teawithtrixie: its a good thing these coneheads  can't comprehend the gate
[1:22:03] demon_dandy: typical ashton convo ashton51Tehe
[1:22:31] NozomeAkimoto: Love the JPG artifacts on the enemy sprite
[1:23:12] nautacon: thoroughly scrunkled

[1:36:51] metaconstruct: time 2 get nebulized ashton51Tehe
[1:37:13] PenguinScotty: Bet it was a cigarette.
[1:37:15] FTLOG_IamDave: this game is what its like to chew 6 gum
[1:37:26] metaconstruct: art reminds me of moebius
[1:37:35] Senoquese: nah this is what ashton sees when she hits that vaporizer

[1:37:51] PenguinScotty: @Senoquese good point good point
[1:38:16] FTLOG_IamDave: @demon_dandy i bet that guy would be good at beatboxing
[1:38:18] NozomeAkimoto: On a youtube comment, the music composer for the sequel said that neither him or the dev can work well while baked, so this was all lucid
[1:39:12] SirSour539: the dev said he was inspired by yume nikki
[1:39:23] demon_dandy: i think its more impressive you could make this lucid ashton51Tensai
[1:40:23] MatchaFae: true!
[1:41:15] naoyukiogura: the successor to off is looking great
[1:41:28] naoyukiogura: no

[1:42:01] demon_dandy: off has some killer tracks ashton51Tehe all i know
[1:42:32] SirSour539: The sequel to this game has some absolute bangers
[1:42:33] demon_dandy: its got da baseball dude ashton51Tensai
[1:42:58] naoyukiogura: yeah, off and undertale is one of those out-of-the-box games that... hoo boy
[1:43:21] demon_dandy: LMAO im only slightly surprised tumblr took to him
[1:43:32] NozomeAkimoto: batter sexyman........
[1:43:40] SirSour539: hylics 2 has an average playthrough time of about 8 hours
[1:43:44] Kitkattack: Undertale is a fine game, the characters are absolutely grating though
[1:43:48] demon_dandy: baseball uniforms are pretty hot
[1:44:33] demon_dandy: the neutral run ashton51Tehe
[1:44:39] Kitkattack: like the level of cushioiny, friendship friendship hope destiny love friendship determination gobbledeegook pisses me off
[1:45:18] naoyukiogura: yeah, tumblr was extreme rabid on that game like gotdamn
[1:45:26] demon_dandy: i like undertale but the fandom, ooo the fandom ashton51Tehe (at the time)
[1:45:28] Kitkattack: it's just nonsense
[1:45:31] SirSour539: I never could get into undertale
[1:45:43] naoyukiogura: one second of criticism earns someone having their inbox flooded with hate
[1:46:16] JTBun: yeah, deltarune I think has a lot more going for it. It has a very cool setting and story
[1:46:20] naoyukiogura: go ahead and spoil, for I won't play the game LMAO
[1:46:21] demon_dandy: SANS?? ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:46:33] Kitkattack: I think it's just perfectly aimed at brain dead kids who think the story is deep
[1:46:50] SirSour539: I can't believe you would spoil a game from 2015 smh my head
[1:46:59] JTBun: I do like undertale, but Deltarun is better
[1:47:05] JTBun: *deltarune
[1:47:42] Kitkattack: hardcore, like the aesthetic, like the game. Story/chara can take a fat ashton51Dumpy
[1:48:16] naoyukiogura: like that dream machine game on PSX?
[1:48:32] NozomeAkimoto: I can't believe Sans knows I played Binding of Isaac, I'm in shambles
[1:49:25] T33bags: Hi Ashton
[1:49:34] JTBun: Deltarune just has better writing and characters
[1:49:39] naoyukiogura: fair
[1:49:46] demon_dandy: i like the mess around aspects of undertale more than the very serious stuff ashton51Tehe
[1:50:15] Kitkattack: that's another thing that pisses me off. People will kneel at the alter of Matpat and crucify anyone who disagrees with his dumbass headcannon
[1:50:47] Senoquese: ashton HATES undertale and got kicked from her COLLAB with TOBY FOX?? ashton51Bork ashton51Bork ashton51Bork
[1:51:05] demon_dandy: Vtuber DRAMA ninoegSCARY ninoegSCARY
[1:51:19] Kitkattack: it's art, it can be wtv you want. he literally disavows every video ending with "it's just a theory" but brainlets will just espouse that shit everywhere
[1:51:21] NozomeAkimoto: aieee I'm calling the cops
[1:51:46] nautacon: vtuber having an opinion?? I'm out
[1:52:06] demon_dandy: you good ashton51Tehe i think youre still being very positive of undertale, im of the same opinion
[1:52:06] SirSour539: it's not delusional, you're just preparing for a possible future
[1:52:08] rikkaonline: it sounds like youre saying some of his fans get a little too invested, so i think he'd probably agree with you
[1:52:17] Kitkattack: Big Man Toby Fox and act surprised the doesn't know the RRRQ ashton51Tensai
[1:52:50] naoyukiogura: "You have 236 new messages and counting."
[1:53:14] Senoquese: well, try to name one popular indie game that didnt get ruined by its fans
[1:53:31] JTBun: @Senoquese celeste lmao
[1:53:43] naoyukiogura: what BL artist LMAO
