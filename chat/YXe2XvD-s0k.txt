[0:46:14] ajvark: to me it was "cringe romance" (like cringe humor) but there's an appeal to it
[0:46:21] Crownvalen: I like romance but good anime is hard to find

[0:49:16] Burr11: lol yapping all over the song ashton51Tehe
[0:49:17] InsaneLoke: it was kept to online only up until this year because its "18+" so it was a little more niche for shonen
[0:49:26] menma945: it’s fairly popular but now that Jjk is over and the anime is out I’m sure it will be
[0:49:30] Burr11: the english versions of yoasobi songs are pretty decent
[0:49:43] HashiriyaR32: Got introduced to Jubyphonic's english covers while checking Will's stuff.  Prior to these two, it was AmaLee's stuff I was checking out.
[0:49:56] InsaneLoke: there isnt *reaaally* side couples, youll have to see
[0:50:04] demon_dandy: Oh theres no vid up unless you know ashton51Baby
[0:50:20] noodsdood69: Creepy Nuts, Eve, Yoasobi, and LiSA are the top when it comes to music, especially OPs
[0:50:32] HashiriyaR32: I think I listened to AmaLee's stuff back in the early 2010s, but only rediscovered them in 2019 because while the original version of "My Dearest" wasn't on spotify at the time, her cover was.
[0:50:53] rikkaonline: anime songs sound weird being able to understand the words
[0:51:00] demon_dandy: I cant handle eng versions mostly ashton51Tehe
[0:51:02] noodsdood69: hot take, Creepy Nuts OP for Call of the Night is better than Mashle S2

[0:52:21] Mastermind_Marx: greetings
[0:52:23] menma945: so many of these cover artist are so popular because for so long these songs weren’t easily available in the west
[0:52:23] demon_dandy: ashton51Woo ashton51Woo ashton51Woo
[0:52:27] HashiriyaR32: How about RADWIMPS' own english versions, since it's the singer himself rewriting the lyrics.

[0:54:21] noodsdood69: No yea there's a full on "the characters of the anime are editing the music video to the song" sequence before it picks back up with the chorus for the finale
[0:54:26] Burr11: you haven't seen it?? ashton51Wibble
[0:54:52] noodsdood69: Nanakusa Nazuna is peak girlfriend material.
[0:54:59] demon_dandy: LMAO i dont know who you talk to about anime ashton51Tehe
[0:55:07] InsaneLoke: dagashi kashi is peak if ur a 15 year old loner
[0:55:34] demon_dandy: I love dagashi kashi but its 100% gag manga
[0:55:39] noodsdood69: wdym you can't recognise Julie Simmons on sight, what kind of weeb are you Kappa
[0:55:43] Kitkattack: you're a FREAK ashton51Dance
[0:55:49] Crownvalen: Some animes are not aimed at global audiences and many people don't realize it
[0:55:52] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul
[0:56:24] demon_dandy: Ashton mr worldwide ashton51Tensai
[0:56:28] Funchucks: anime ended in 2007, with the debut of Strike Witches, which could only be made once Japan had completely run out of anime ideas and just started making random things into girls
[0:56:30] noodsdood69: okay but when are you releasing a duet cover with her Kappa
[0:56:33] fsteakk: the subtle off white coloring...
[0:56:43] FranzNF: honestly dagashi kashi was a big candy commercial with a coating of fanservice
[0:56:56] Kitkattack: pushes up glasses ashton51Tensai
[0:56:57] demon_dandy: Yeah i like dagashi kashi, i cant imagine gassing it up
[0:57:02] Senoquese: she is shrimply a superior nichijou fan
[0:57:12] FranzNF: but Yofukashi no Uta has a very inmersive plot from start to finish
[0:57:27] katsuragi_kakeruvt: extreme nepo babies
[0:57:27] Navy_Mongoose: I think I know that vid ashton51Omegalul
[0:57:28] noodsdood69: so true, I liked Dagashi Kashi because the jokes made off-hand about things were pretty solid chuckle inducing every time.
[0:57:29] Burr11: "hah, only i actually get nichijou" ashton51Tensai

[0:58:08] InsaneLoke: cultural exchange is always fun to see
[0:58:18] menma945: so much comedy and niche anime struggle with localization because so much is lost
[0:58:20] Crownvalen: Some scenes of nichijou are actual nonsense though lmao
[0:58:45] Navy_Mongoose: "Acquisition" is misspelled
[0:58:59] noodsdood69: It's a solid formula, (Question, answer, fanservice, joke)
[0:59:15] Kitkattack: yeah fanservice is a very prevalent thing
[0:59:33] ajvark: what if the dagashi kashi artist did fanart of you? you think they're on skeb?
[0:59:34] Crossbowflex: yeah even not having that cultural reference frame you can still recognize the jokes in Nichijou as jokes more than in, say, Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei
[0:59:35] HashiriyaR32: AYO
[0:59:46] demon_dandy: LMAO
[0:59:46] Kitkattack: ho boy that asmr

[1:00:07] Burr11: lol
[1:00:26] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:00:51] TheAsterite: so it needs a high cultural iq to understand?
[1:00:54] LordMop23: what did I tune in to?
[1:00:56] FranzNF: oh then maybe you'd hate shimoseka
[1:00:57] Kitkattack: I mean I don't really enjoy food wars but I do like cooking a lot
[1:01:02] Kitkattack: for sort of the same reason
[1:01:07] demon_dandy: Yeah like food wars
[1:01:07] asmallcat013: sometimes all you need is slapstick comedy as you usually don't need dialogue for most of it
[1:01:12] Crownvalen: Dagashi kashi is not a good gag show though
[1:01:13] noodsdood69: Don't worry, I've watched all of the Monogatari series (not the movies) so I'm used to not getting references in anime :)
[1:01:16] rikkaonline: theres so much sexual content but it never actually goes anywhere. thats what i hate about it
[1:01:23] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: i will always remember the toothbrush scene
[1:01:28] rikkaonline: like go be a couple
[1:01:44] noodsdood69: also the fact the MC's name is KOKONOTSU KEKW
[1:01:52] noodsdood69: bro is named coconuts
[1:01:52] JTBun: thats why Fire Force is horrible, just fanservice and sexual stuff all the time... sucks
[1:01:55] Burr11: what about bokuyaba.. i was not expecting the sex gags when it's wholesome a lot of the time..
[1:01:57] ajvark: dagashi kashi american live action remake
[1:02:10] demon_dandy: Another amq stream ashton51Omegalul
[1:02:13] ajvark: it flashed in my head and now i must spread the curse
[1:02:23] JTBun: yeah it is
[1:02:24] noodsdood69: hey wait, Fire Force is cool.
[1:02:26] ajvark: @demon_dandy anime music quideos
[1:02:28] InsaneLoke: fire force is good when you cut out all the fan service bits, like actual peak i fear

[1:02:46] JTBun: @noodsdood69 no, Fire Force IS COOL, but fuck too much fanservice all the time
[1:02:48] katsuragi_kakeruvt: one season of to love ru completely ruined any form of sexual comedy LOL
[1:02:59] TheAsterite: probably because maka and soul are relatively chill

[1:03:16] noodsdood69: boobs keep you invested, then some dude moves faster than the speed of light to hit you from a different dimension, that's PEAK
[1:03:25] Crownvalen: Seitokai yakuindomo is an actual actual shimoneta show it has sexual gags but is not nsfw at all
[1:03:43] Kitkattack: it's that it doesn't go anywhere, like rikka was saying. It's just kind of inserted for the hell of it
[1:03:44] katsuragi_kakeruvt: its from that era so it plays on the nostalgia a bit
[1:03:46] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[1:03:47] JTBun: I feel like soul eater might be more tasteful than Fire force, but then again I havent watch it in years
[1:03:57] Crossbowflex: havent thought about Seitokai Yakuindomo in a long time
[1:04:03] rikkaonline: i want to see a "oops i fell on you crotch first" thing happen and then the characters dont freak about it, but own it
[1:04:15] Senoquese: i get that. i was fine w pervy humor back then w like, full metal panic being full of it, but now i watch my hero and i need to close it the moment i see mineta
[1:04:18] demon_dandy: @jtbun i wouldnt say its more or less tasteful buts its def less cringe about it ashton51Tehe
[1:04:20] ajvark: i rdeemed a hydrate earlier
[1:04:28] noodsdood69: Like that scene in Amazing World of Gumball KEKW
[1:04:30] InsaneLoke: boku my hero...
[1:04:36] JTBun: @demon_dandy yeah, that's what I meant, yeah not tasteful
[1:04:54] ajvark: @InsaneLoke *bokus your hero*
[1:04:54] Crownvalen: I say shimoneta as sexual gag it's literally the meaning
[1:04:58] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:05:23] noodsdood69: "A world where the concept of dirty jokes doesn't exist"
[1:05:27] ajvark: i miss the girl who voiced that love nector girl
[1:05:28] demon_dandy: i couldnt watch shimoneta but i fw SYD i dunno know why ashton51Tehe
[1:05:33] rikkaonline: damn you could deez nuts everyone on the planet there
[1:05:39] asmallcat013: that one was just horny
[1:05:51] noodsdood69: Also, I've seen it shortened to Shimoseka as well as Shimoneta.
[1:05:56] HashiriyaR32: "one of the VAs passed away"   Miyu Matsuki was in shimoneta?
[1:06:04] HashiriyaR32: or someone else you're thinking of?
[1:06:08] ajvark: @HashiriyaR32 yeah she was the love nectar girl
[1:06:14] menma945: I saw like two minutes of that anime the. clicked off lmao
[1:06:36] Burr11: love nectar girl ashton51Omegalul
[1:06:40] FranzNF: i'm guilty of enjoying all of them, from the most tame to the raunchier ones
[1:06:45] Iz_zl: oh, was on Nyaruko
[1:06:53] noodsdood69: GOD the fact she's so insane for the MC in that that he has to make sure he's super clean so she can't tell it's him based on SMELL is hilarious to me KEKW
[1:07:01] demon_dandy: I remember the gif of the girl yoinkin that metal bar and was like ehh Clueless
[1:07:31] Burr11: i'm pretty desensitized to pretty much any anime ecchi at this point
[1:07:32] StreamElements: I have my own flavor of AdvancedGG Energy available for purchase for a limited time!! Get your tub of Race Queen Ramune and don't forget your Ashton Marten shaker for a crisp refreshing summer with me! 🥤  https://advanced.gg/pages/partner-ashton-marten?ref=ashton
[1:07:41] noodsdood69: no yea Dagashi Kashi is like a 4/10 but I enjoyed it.
[1:07:48] InsaneLoke: the worst part of dagashi kashi is definitely the fact that there is ZERO romantic payoff for any of the ships really
[1:08:04] ajvark: i think you're just more aware
[1:08:11] dyingalone1990: dull surprise
[1:08:11] ajvark: like you know what spongebob meant by leapfrog
[1:08:13] noodsdood69: You want to be desensitized again? Watch Haganai KEKW
[1:08:18] Senoquese: ashton51Despair
[1:08:21] rikkaonline: there is a version of dagashi kashi that is good, but we didnt get it
[1:08:25] FranzNF: 50% of their content was publicity for candy tbh, i think that one is one of the less guilty one from the fanservice/ecchi overflow
[1:08:28] Kitkattack: ashton51Nightmare ashton51Nightmare ashton51Nightmare
[1:08:31] Burr11: lol mortality time again!! yipee!! ashton51Baby
[1:08:32] demon_dandy: I mean i have a very out of it take on dagashi kashi and its more a dive into the author but im fond of it for things other than its fanservice and gags ashton51Omegalul
[1:08:36] noodsdood69: yeah, Friendship Club!
[1:08:38] katsuragi_kakeruvt: that made me think of what was it... blood C the one with the bunny things that blended the people into a smoothie LOL
[1:08:39] Burr11: haganai was excellent
[1:08:43] demon_dandy: Oh my god the girl called meat...
[1:08:46] Kitkattack: we loving the melancholy of pondering our fleeting existence
[1:08:51] Burr11: science girl was the best
[1:08:52] dyingalone1990: so many fuck you read the manga shows.
[1:09:01] InsaneLoke: omg haganai, that used to be the only thing on the funimation cable channel back in like 2015
[1:09:07] demon_dandy: Broooo ehhh nanadatte posting in 2024 ICANT ICANT ICANT
[1:09:17] katsuragi_kakeruvt: that fit is ASS
[1:09:17] InsaneLoke: i fw with the hair though
[1:09:20] Burr11: lmaoooooo
[1:09:26] noodsdood69: AND THE FACT THE MAID GIRL THOUGHT SHE WAS A GUY AND FOUND OUT SHE'S ACTUALLY A GIRL IN SEASON TWO KEKW
[1:09:27] demon_dandy: Nah he got that shit onnnn
[1:09:27] pingufrend: ew ..

[1:09:35] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: the mysterious socks
[1:09:37] katsuragi_kakeruvt: bro rolled up the pants...
[1:09:37] TheAsterite: is that an author self insert
[1:09:39] ajvark: what if he crocs
[1:09:41] FranzNF: bro had such a negative aura he dialed back up to 10
[1:09:44] HashiriyaR32: Yeah, you wouldn't catch me dead wearing that.......
[1:09:44] ajvark: ashton what if he had crocs
[1:09:46] Sushipuggo: the PEAK male
[1:09:48] demon_dandy: The chain goe heavy ashton51Tensai
[1:09:50] Burr11: yeah i didnt remember his feet looked like that lmao
[1:09:52] FranzNF: at least drip-wise
[1:09:53] menma945: woah woah he could be wearing no show socks
[1:09:56] dyingalone1990: total escapism the same way ouran is.
[1:10:05] pingufrend: uncuffed sleeves + belt is CRAZY
[1:10:28] Crossbowflex: he looks like one of the characters from Daily Lives of Highschool Boys
[1:10:31] noodsdood69: tbf you never see his feet KEKW
[1:10:37] asmallcat013: and then they introduce another 3 i think in the second season
[1:10:39] katsuragi_kakeruvt: he should get his bangs off his 5head
[1:10:39] demon_dandy: he was like the dense mc singularity though
[1:10:52] Crownvalen: The anime is named literally I don't have many friends so it kinda checks out
[1:11:06] snakpak_tv: snakpak_tv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:11:08] noodsdood69: No but that was an entire plot point, he didn't want to ruin his friendships by getting romantic so he was dense on purpose! It was so good!
[1:11:14] FranzNF: mild spoilers for a don't-know-how-many-years old series already, but i felt betrayed when they took the femboy away from me by making her a girl on that series
[1:11:24] demon_dandy: Oregairu?
[1:11:34] katsuragi_kakeruvt: ???? HUH
[1:11:43] asmallcat013: doesn't he choose his teacher over the others at one point
[1:11:49] dyingalone1990: anime is nothing but recycled tropes.
[1:11:49] demon_dandy: LOL
[1:11:49] InsaneLoke: i support you
[1:11:53] noodsdood69: Snafu is the one with the big gorilla man? Or is it the other one?
[1:12:03] breezyluv__: Just wanted to say i love your model and aesthetics ashton51Smile
[1:12:04] Burr11: oregairu? no he doesnt pick the teacher lol

[1:12:14] HashiriyaR32: AYO
[1:12:14] JTBun: HJGSFJHGJKSDFG
[1:12:17] InsaneLoke: @asmallcat013 wait, i think i know what anime ur talking about, i think thats quintuplets
[1:12:22] noodsdood69: Speaking of harem romance manga, y'all remember Nisekoi?
[1:12:25] TheAsterite: ashton51Hehe ashton51Hehe
[1:12:26] breezyluv__: Ive seen worse dw about it

[1:13:00] InsaneLoke: what WAS that harem where the guy chose the teacher, i cant remember what it was but it made me so mad
[1:13:03] dyingalone1990: fushigi yugi is the female equivalent.
[1:13:03] FranzNF: as if he would stop at a finger lol
[1:13:06] Sushipuggo: I didn't know ashton was based like that
[1:13:08] noodsdood69: speaking of unhinged authors, I can't believe the author behind Emergence made the meme Jojo ending canon.
[1:13:12] Burr11: so you're saying if i take a finger up the butt, i get a harem?
[1:13:13] Crownvalen: Girl authors make so good manga mushishi was made by a woman mangaka
[1:13:26] rikkaonline: if the girls wanted it, hed make it happen
[1:13:35] Iz_zl: @InsaneLoke domestic kanojo?
[1:13:47] InsaneLoke: ohhh yeah
[1:13:49] Burr11: well then ladies... ashton51Heh
[1:13:52] asmallcat013: the one where he chooses the teacher is the i can't study anime i think, and that's only cause they do multiple routes
[1:13:53] dyingalone1990: I have
[1:14:01] demon_dandy: I mean the teacher was also like a step sister
[1:14:05] InsaneLoke: @Iz_zl wait im not sure
