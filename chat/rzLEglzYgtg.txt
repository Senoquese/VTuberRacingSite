[1:35:21] PSYCOMMUnist: Ashton restored my youth tonight
[1:35:24] Romblymo: 22-35 is probably the primary demographic
[1:35:24] spikebomb5: ppl are still young and pretty until like mid 40s nowadays
[1:35:24] DavidPortnov: I'm not really surprised given cultural touchpoints that come up sometimes.
[1:35:27] Kitkattack: unemployed 20yo's have SOOOOO much free ime think about it

[1:46:52] Qrockpot: marinated intelligience
[1:47:03] PSYCOMMUnist: I thought you were always a big twerp?
[1:47:04] pogotross: hearing about TWRP in a non-NSP context is weird
[1:47:16] DavidPortnov: Game Grumps?
[1:47:24] BweadTag: TWRP has their own amazing thing going on that doesn't involve NSP
[1:47:32] pogotross: that's valid
[1:47:45] Kitkattack: cormorbid ashton51Omegalul
[1:47:46] GManx0: NSP doing covers is neat
[1:47:47] BweadTag: Do you have any big thoughts on the protomen?
[1:47:48] DavidPortnov: I like them less now than I did when I found out about them (NSP).
[1:47:55] F1nalStarman: TWRP was cool before their collabs with NSP. I say that as someone who has seen both live.
[1:47:59] mareeples: It's your fault (affectionate) that I've been listening to that Malcom Todd song you mentioned on loop. It took over.
[1:48:06] GManx0: They did like two covers albums
[1:48:07] MelvinSoupreme: um
[1:48:15] Qrockpot: DID THEY????? NOOOOOOO
[1:48:21] spikebomb5: anamanaguchi and protomen ashton51Stare
[1:48:28] BweadTag: Protomen is the Linda thing you should read along the lyrics and notes for ur first listen, it's kind of a task
[1:48:31] bonatide: Erm keroke12Ehh
[1:48:45] dynamozx05: The Protomen is basically the greatest Mega Man tribute band that doesn't require you to have any previous knowledge on Mega Man at all to be a fan of, they're just that good
[1:48:48] Navy_Mongoose: lmao my top song of the years is Fuwamoco karaoke
[1:48:49] Qrockpot: my fav song of his is Roommates

[1:49:23] spikebomb5: christopher cross the goat
[1:49:32] redactedenheim: not yacht prog?

[1:50:16] GManx0: You have not heard it in like 10 years
[1:50:23] ArthurWar: It's silly but it's fun to listen to
[1:50:24] applecadough: U stream starfox?

[1:51:06] spikebomb5: true, thats like saying u only listen to anime/videogame osts LUL
[1:51:08] BweadTag: I exclusively listen to music with an ironic twist
[1:51:09] redactedenheim: you can't say that until you've listened to the Brett Domino Trio
[1:51:31] Kitkattack: it's great how an hour ago you mentioned just getting right into the game om
[1:51:37] Burr11: @spikebomb5 i think it's worse because its so dependent on other material
[1:51:50] Qrockpot: WEIRD AL CLEARS peak lyricist
[1:51:53] GManx0: Derivative
[1:52:00] pogotross: I think most hardcore Weird Al fans like his originalish stuff more
[1:52:07] BweadTag: Weird Al also has plenty of banger originals
[1:52:18] Burr11: yeah he does
[1:52:18] redactedenheim: but but what about Vanilla Ice?
[1:52:19] demon_dandy: We WILL be listening to Geek vs Nerd RAP BATTLE
[1:52:21] Navy_Mongoose: of course

[1:52:32] Navy_Mongoose: Ashton sings Weird Al's "Hardware Store" when?
[1:52:33] ArthurWar: LOL
[1:52:34] BweadTag: We need an Anthony fantano style Ashton music review stream

[1:54:15] redactedenheim: my favorite song is sticking out your gyatt for nerizzler
[1:54:19] sirmars1: I love Weird Al. But the cool thing is he gets permission from ever artist he parodies.
[1:54:21] timinator193: So? ashton51Pathetic
[1:54:26] BweadTag: I've listened to every song ever written and Idubbz is my favourite rapper
[1:54:39] rikkaonline: that music loop is unironically pretty good
[1:54:50] demon_dandy: I think its crazy vanilla ice got a stand i only know one song of his
[1:54:50] Navy_Mongoose: today I learned that one anime meme song is a fucking touhou song that's been in my library for a decade
[1:55:03] Burr11: you're so bau bau
[1:55:04] tidalvoid_: How do we feel about swancore (e.g., dance gavin dance) chat ?
[1:55:08] redactedenheim: Hole? No, I couldn't even ironically listen to Hole
[1:55:13] Kitkattack: I just want to be your shiorin~
[1:55:16] bonatide: Suwakos theme 100%
[1:55:18] COSMOsickle: koseki1Smile koseki1Smile koseki1Smile
[1:55:23] rikkaonline: anything with 808 cowbell is good
[1:55:27] timinator193: I listen to songs that all of my friends hate
[1:55:29] pogotross: is swancore like...bands influenced by Swans?
[1:55:33] COSMOsickle: koseki1Dangit
[1:55:38] spikebomb5: sounds like an internet created subgenre
[1:55:41] Burr11: bed squeak my beloved
[1:55:44] GManx0: So can I like Weezer or not
[1:55:46] demon_dandy: ashton51Omegalul ashton51Omegalul
[1:55:47] F1nalStarman: What is swancore? Does that include Geese and Goose? ashton51Omegalul
[1:55:48] cherryuri_: HI ASHTON!!!
[1:55:55] pogotross: @GManx0 yes but 80% ironically
[1:55:56] Navy_Mongoose: no, it's a Bossa Nova song, that has the high almost squeaky voice. and the bsais for MC Virgin's "Anime Thighs"
[1:56:00] Qrockpot: favorite weez?
[1:56:04] Burr11: the conflict is she knows seno likes weezer
[1:56:06] Senoquese: you cant enjoy weezer without reading up all the lore about how the main singer is not actually a pedo
[1:56:14] Qrockpot: lol seno
[1:56:14] pogotross: @Senoquese om
[1:56:18] Burr11: lol
[1:56:18] tidalvoid_: funky music with a pop lead singer and an occasional screaming guy lmao
[1:56:18] bonatide: Hating weezer is a sign of being 30+
[1:56:18] Navy_Mongoose: because Weezer has gotten progressively worse since Green Album
[1:56:23] DavidPortnov: I've seen Weezer referred to as "nerd music" and I find that weird.
[1:56:32] pogotross: they were geniune at the wrong time and ironic too soon
[1:56:50] Kitkattack: not me going 100 down the icy stretch of the skyway BLASTING Racing Line ashton51Steer
[1:56:57] PSYCOMMUnist: they were ok, I bought the green album that's about it lol
[1:57:00] Senoquese: thats exactly what they did
[1:57:02] F1nalStarman: Oversaturation of Weezer is part of the problem. You can only hear Buddy Holly and Beverly Hills so many times before you get sick of it.
[1:57:04] redactedenheim: so Nickelback
[1:57:06] pogotross: BEVERLY HILLS, THAT'S WHERE I WAN TO BEEEE
[1:57:08] tidalvoid_: well technically hardcore, but the guitarist goes crazy sometimes
[1:57:09] Senoquese: they were AMAAZING at garage rock and they moved to shitty pop for like 2 albums
[1:57:10] Navy_Mongoose: that too, they started as an awesome rock band then decided they wanted to be a shitty pop band
[1:57:32] PSYCOMMUnist: I think it'd be weird to have such a strong opinion about such a normal band lol
[1:57:40] F1nalStarman: Charlie Puth catching strays D:
[1:57:58] Senoquese: they are actually musical geniuses imo and they thought they could conquer every single genre and failed at that
