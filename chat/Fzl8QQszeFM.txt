[0:34:38] fromorra: Shana was too Shitty Light Novel fantasy
[0:34:51] NanaseCain: honestly big agree, I was cool with it at the age it came out at but looking back at it it REALLY wasn't that good
[0:34:54] demon_dandy: Shana looked so cool tho ashton51Tehe
[0:35:20] fromorra: I liked Shana but I was a really shitty teen
[0:35:25] demon_dandy: I mean from the outside, seeing the trailers and stuff ashton51Baby
[0:35:43] raisenkororo: The main character in Shana is nothing literally nothing

[0:37:55] mczub: and toonami
[0:37:56] demon_dandy: Galactic heroes was always like the "THIS one is what cultured people recommend" LMAO
[0:38:15] NanaseCain: yotsuba NEEDED to be made in the mid 2000s
[0:38:25] Zerorush: He doesn’t think Yotsuba would fit as an anime but like, Azumanga is the same format and it’s GREAT
[0:38:32] Lucha_Ace: It's half classic shonen and then some absolute masterpieces, then some off kilter comedies. Very disconnected
[0:38:38] CINO_p: do you like dragon ball?
[0:38:56] demon_dandy: I respect the watamote pick tho ashton51Tensai
[0:39:01] bunnysleepover: lol fr fr

[0:39:09] fromorra: If Yotsuba& anime exiated and isn't primarily consumed in the west via crappy fansub torrents it just wouldn't feel right
[0:39:17] bunnysleepover: watamote is great but def the outlier

[0:40:09] demon_dandy: Its very battle shonen but its got a good heart ashton51Tehe
[0:40:23] stormy_halo: this is toonami to adult swim to 4chan pipeline
[0:40:38] Zerorush: I think the trend of female main characters that Watamote  helped start who were like, super otaku was kind of cringe tbh.
[0:40:39] demon_dandy: LMAO
[0:40:43] fromorra: Liking Dragonball is a lot like liking hockey  or football. It may not be a favorite thing to do but it can give you something to talk about with relatively normal people

[0:44:16] behoimii: never forget the old bocchi applec26SADGE
[0:44:16] Arbar_: I feel like the messages of the shows are vastly different
[0:44:17] beat_shobon: I don't think Bocchi and K-ON aim for the same goals

[0:45:30] justcerebro: promised neverland isn't obscure at all what the heck
[0:45:35] MaimeMeow: anime 2nd season broke my heart by failing

[0:59:29] Kitkattack: 2 and 7 are the jojo's for me
[0:59:39] demon_dandy: I do love part 2 ashton51Tensai

[1:18:36] fromorra: Yuru Camp combines foodservice with cute girls doing stuff, nice scenery, and cozy ambience, so it makes sense that it's so popular
[1:18:43] CINO_p: she hates grass

[1:19:34] Foxxu_: the order is a rabbit is also a good one for that
[1:19:34] the_mechanicat: Reject grass, touch asphalt! themec18Bike
[1:19:43] Kitkattack: inclement weather is just a challenge
[1:19:45] demon_dandy: Glamping is like camping at a astroturf built up area
[1:19:46] rikkaonline: yeah yama started as 5 minute eps
[1:19:48] mushi_buns: I like Yuru camp for the food not the girls fr
[1:19:49] CrumblyBits: WOOO baybe ASPHALT
[1:19:49] stormy_halo: glamping is good. bugs and exposure are not good.
[1:20:05] Senoquese: im gonna cover myself in grass next time ashton threatens to throw me ashton51Tensai
[1:20:06] phatscout: I thought YoriMoi was the cultured yurucamp???
[1:20:15] Zerorush: Zerorush is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to AshtonMarten's community! They've gifted a total of 38 in the channel! 
[1:20:15] Zerorush: Zerorush gifted a Tier 1 sub to Lucha_Ace! 
[1:20:23] kevx59: Yumu no Susume has the problem that the episodes are  short. The background art itself is great though.
[1:20:27] InsaneLoke: Eeek I hated the idea of touching the ground as a kid
[1:20:35] DetonatorMoe: yeah i can see that
[1:20:40] Lucha_Ace: @Zerorush Thanks for the gift sub! ashton51Wiggly

[1:20:51] bunnysleepover: ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[1:21:07] demon_dandy: I liked how the characters interacted in yuru camp tho, i dont think many series reflect that type of dynamic
[1:21:07] beat_shobon: Nothing bad with an anime being geared more into a niche but less people being into it is to be expected by default then
[1:21:11] kevx59: I feel that. Though it had the opposite effect in that it makes me wanna camp more
[1:21:29] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:21:35] chico421: slow loop
[1:21:44] ReyJaggy: Ash cant related cause chinchillas cant play guitars

[1:22:05] Zerorush: I’m telling ya, after K-on everyone is still trying to find the new big hit “k-on” show lol
[1:22:07] phatscout: Yeah but it's it ABOUT fly fishing??
[1:22:10] stormy_halo: BTR was inspirational.
[1:22:12] phatscout: Like as a cultural concept
[1:22:19] phatscout: and what fly fishing means to people
[1:22:33] CrumblyBits: it was those strange bocchi meltdown scenes for me
[1:22:35] phatscout: or is it just fly fishing as an excuse for cgdgt antics
[1:22:37] NanaseCain: at this point if japan ever needs a particular industry boosted all they need to do is produce a cute girls anime doing (industry that needs boosting)
[1:22:43] MaimeMeow: slow loop was cute, but i only watch 3 eps
[1:22:47] demon_dandy: Fly fishing is fishing with lures thst float
[1:23:03] CrumblyBits: one of them were just like a vrchat scene outta nowhere
[1:23:05] CINO_p: coincidentally, i also like fishing
[1:23:23] mushi_buns: I hate camping but like yuru camp BibleThump
[1:23:46] Kitkattack: I feel like I couldn't enjoy it to much if I didn't just want another story about fishing
[1:23:51] demon_dandy: Yeah the way yuru camp characters  interact was so unique and special ashton51Tehe
[1:23:55] chico421: i found recently that there was a Bocchi the Rock cameo in Slow Loop
[1:23:57] kawaiicrew4ever: girls und panzer spotted
[1:23:59] phatscout: I'm pretty sure if you went up the average fisher and showed them slow loop they'd think it sucks tbh
[1:24:20] demon_dandy: GuP is very valid ashton51Tensai
[1:24:21] NanaseCain: onsen anime would actually sell like hotcakes

[1:24:47] NanaseCain: well it's more like a ryokan
[1:24:51] phatscout: like slow loop isn't to fishing what saki is to majong or initial d is to people who wanna togue low horsepower affordable rwd sedans

[1:38:14] fromorra: Yurikuma works if you see it as a look at how lesbians are depicted and both fetishized and demonized in Japanese media and culture

[2:32:53] Returner7: idk this list just strikes me as someone who was mainly active in the late 2000s  !!!
[2:32:53] mushi_buns: the art of Ouran is so so good
[2:32:56] InsaneLoke: Baby’s first yaoi series

[2:34:48] Lucha_Ace: I don't know anyone who rooted for Haruhi x Tamaki tbh
[2:34:54] CrumblyBits: i think ouran was just still in that harem trap where 1 character was CLEARLY going to be the one
[2:35:07] Lucha_Ace: Haruhi is a good protag tho
[2:35:08] CrumblyBits: and they just teased the other supporting characters

[2:37:23] Returner7: It was awesome watching Haruhi in release order as it release, with the whole a-chronological order thing
[2:37:24] barfchan: ^
[2:37:24] InsaneLoke: You danced it
[2:37:25] rikkaonline: endless 8 was the worst waste of 6 episodes ever

[4:25:48] Navy_Mongoose: I think at least 50% of nichijou's jokes make you laugh regardless of comprehension
[4:25:58] InsaneLoke: I should probably rewatch nichijo. It was the first anime I ever watched on crunchyroll in 2014
[4:26:06] Foxxu_: i miss translator notes
[4:26:14] beat_shobon: as someone who loves the anime I actually never expected Nichijou would become that popular when I watched it during its airing time because of the nature of its jokes
[4:26:14] kevx59: Nichijou does have the benefit of some great visual comedy though
[4:26:23] kawaiicrew4ever: [untranslatable Japanese idiom]

[4:27:12] demon_dandy: Lmao than manga that got deemed untranslateable and got dropped by the official TLers
[4:27:18] raisenkororo: I’ve always wanted to read the Monogatari LNs but they’re notorious for Nisio Isin’s writing style so I want to learn japanese to read those
[4:27:20] horribleham: Ashton gets ALL the jokes though because her brain is so smooth and pink ashton51Tensai unlike our wrinkly pitcrew brains.

[4:27:31] Navy_Mongoose: FLCL dub>sub
[4:27:38] Foxxu_: true
[4:27:46] JTBun: @Navy_Mongoose yeah, FLCL has an AMAZING sub
[4:27:46] InsaneLoke: That’s closer to localization, and I love stuff like that, like the Lupin part 2 dub
[4:27:46] Returner7: I feel like these days the predominate style is to try to localize the script rather than faithful translation
[4:27:51] JTBun: *dub
[4:27:55] Kitkattack: lol *rattles head*
[4:27:58] kevx59: Those japanese only references kills a lot of shaft shows for me though. Like Monogatari and Zetsubou

[5:05:13] kawaiicrew4ever: @demon_dandy it used to be a fav for me, kinda wanna rewatch
[5:05:15] kevx59: Shimoneta is ridiculous in an entertaining way
[5:05:20] CrumblyBits: shimoneta was shameless while seitokai yakuindomo was tasteful i guess

[5:05:52] kawaiicrew4ever: @CrumblyBits yeah i liked that about seitokai idk
[5:05:59] ninoegyn: idk why the way ashton says "clear card" scratches my brain so good
[5:06:06] bunnysleepover: wasnt mind boggling but I think holds up and has stayed in my mind rent free since airing
[5:06:11] gkgnynsm: soul eater is a classic
[5:06:13] Cocoflojo12: oh yeah
[5:06:20] Foxxu_: TM Revolution didn't have to go as hard as he did for the intro
[5:06:30] gkgnynsm: @foxxu_ TRUE
[5:06:31] Returner7: yes Soul Eater is a 100% classic
[5:06:32] behoimii: i feel like almost all of those animes were so recent echori4Panik
[5:06:42] InsaneLoke: Fire force isn’t that bad, the manga just didn’t start off with the clsssic soul eater style but later fire force is very much soul eater style
[5:06:46] demon_dandy: I could go on for days about soul eater and fire force being diametrically opposite but I love both of em
[5:06:47] CrumblyBits: i do not believe the japanese used tumblr
[5:06:49] ninoegyn: soul eater. life changing
[5:07:00] ninoegyn: IDK WHY I DIDN'T PUT IT IN MY 3X3

[5:07:25] hahahi5: Mayday is a banger tho
[5:07:27] CrumblyBits: the battle system in soul eater? GOD so good
[5:07:30] InsaneLoke: Fire force gets WAY less moeblob by the middle
[5:07:35] JuiceNozzle: OH MY GOD THERE WAS A LINK IN THE TWEET
[5:07:35] JTBun: @hahahi5 trueeeeee
[5:07:37] kawaiicrew4ever: fire force wasnt too great
[5:07:42] JuiceNozzle: I CROPPED THEM IN PHOTOSHOP LMAO
[5:07:49] demon_dandy: Fire force is good imo :)
[5:07:50] Foxxu_: Komi is there mainly cause I've been reading the manga since volume 3 came out
[5:07:55] Returner7: I dropped Fire Force after 3 episodes
[5:07:56] InsaneLoke: It looks just like classic soul eater by the end
[5:07:58] InsaneLoke: It’s crazy
[5:08:01] kawaiicrew4ever: idk why i didnt watch soul eater as a kid i always thought it looked slick as hell
[5:08:11] kevx59: I actually liked Fire Force but had no interest on Soul Eater
[5:08:29] CrumblyBits: i was only a fan of benimaru in fire force, the others were kinda meh...
[5:08:34] JTBun: Fire Force has potential
[5:08:43] InsaneLoke: Fire force has a better concept methinks
[5:08:49] InsaneLoke: But I love both
[5:08:49] JTBun: but it has os much dragging it down... like a ton of unneeded fan service
[5:09:00] JuiceNozzle: I think soul eater crashed harder than bleach
[5:09:01] demon_dandy: I love both :)
[5:09:05] TheAsterite: Soul eater's original ending lost it for me
[5:09:13] InsaneLoke: Soul eater was one of my first anime and I watch it every halloween
[5:09:17] Returner7: really?!
[5:09:27] niertlwal: can a soul eater boy fall in love with a fire force girl
[5:09:35] kevx59: Honestly yeah. Like the dieselpunk style of Fire Force me.
[5:09:37] niertlwal: tips cowboy hat
[5:09:41] InsaneLoke: I think David Pro should do soul eater reboot after they finish fire force
[5:09:41] Returner7: I though the Bleach manga definitely crashed and burned harder than Soul Eater
[5:09:43] horribleham: lol
[5:09:47] Foxxu_: lmao
[5:09:55] horribleham: Assigned: MAN
[5:10:05] gkgnynsm: i only watch fanservice that women like
[5:10:10] InsaneLoke: That’s why the sound design is so cracked in Fire Force

[5:33:56] ninoegyn: i actually
[5:34:06] kawaiicrew4ever: i wish the web novels were better translated
[5:34:14] rikkaonline: the protag in mushoku is growing, but i think the anime still being from his degen  pov is kind of iffy
[5:34:24] ninoegyn: don't mind rudy's scuminess cuz its a very real remnant from his past life
[5:34:26] kawaiicrew4ever: ???
[5:34:29] ninoegyn: WHAAAT
[5:34:31] ninoegyn: WDYM
[5:34:35] DokiDumpster: ya mushoku, its like masterpeice but because start is just so cringe i can't reccomend it to anyone
[5:34:37] ReyJaggy: Mushoku is THE isekai
[5:34:38] kawaiicrew4ever: THAT'S LIKE HALF THE ANIME
[5:34:45] kawaiicrew4ever: he literally talks to god in his past form
[5:34:46] horribleham: Dropped that manga after a while.
[5:34:49] InsaneLoke: Yeah why did it have to be an isekai, couldn’t it just have been just Kid Genius
[5:34:52] ninoegyn: YEAH THE MAN GOD
[5:34:57] kawaiicrew4ever: Ur insane
[5:34:59] kawaiicrew4ever: HIS MONOLOGUE
[5:35:00] kawaiicrew4ever: IS LITERALLY
[5:35:02] Navy_Mongoose: Isekai is for writers who want to write an adventure but are afraid of being unoriginal
[5:35:03] kawaiicrew4ever: HIS PAST VOICE
[5:35:13] rikkaonline: isekai is necessary for him to grow
[5:35:18] kawaiicrew4ever: HE'S LITERALLY USING HIS 37 YR OLD BRAIN TO MAKE DECISIONS
[5:35:19] joic3r: oh man i just remembered this light novel
[5:35:22] demon_dandy: LMAO
[5:35:23] kawaiicrew4ever: Oh my goodness gracious
[5:35:24] joic3r: what a terrible novel
[5:35:33] ninoegyn: i feel like mushoku is one of the few isekai that actually significantly relies on the fact that the protag has been brought into a new world
[5:35:34] ReyJaggy: he steals panties lol
[5:35:35] InsaneLoke: I’m saying he could be just a kid genius
[5:35:36] kawaiicrew4ever: ya he's an awful human being
[5:35:39] ninoegyn: TO SHOW HIS GROWTH
[5:35:46] rikkaonline: the fact that it doesnt matter too much is imo what helps it be good
[5:35:51] rikkaonline: a good isekai*
[5:36:10] horribleham: Disagree on this take ashton. Not cookin nakoryCry
[5:36:12] kawaiicrew4ever: Ok.

[5:36:30] ReyJaggy: I think you would like Sevens another good isekai novel
[5:36:37] kawaiicrew4ever: only valid part is that rudy's a cute boy
[5:36:40] InsaneLoke: Ageee on this tske
[5:36:52] NanaseCain: isekai is an overdone setting at this point anyways
[5:36:54] InsaneLoke: I hate mushoku tensei
[5:36:57] rikkaonline: people shit on it because the pov of the show is too sympathetic to his shittiness
[5:37:01] InsaneLoke: Cus his old self exists
[5:37:09] behoimii: keroke12Sip
[5:37:13] demon_dandy: i agree on this take ashton51Tensai (never watched the show)
[5:37:23] joic3r: i read the novels, its hot fire
[5:37:28] kawaiicrew4ever: begrudgingly shakes your hand
[5:37:36] rikkaonline: thats my one gripe with it
[5:37:37] joic3r: and not good fire
[5:37:53] Cocoflojo12: he's never punished
[5:37:59] niertlwal: purgatory isn't supposed to make sense
[5:38:03] joic3r: thats isekais in general, its a harem power fantasy
[5:38:04] kawaiicrew4ever: i just like escapist media i'm a juvenile ok
[5:38:05] ninoegyn: i guess aside from his pervyness i think its nice that his over-confidence actually costs people lives
[5:38:09] demon_dandy: nino did get cooked ninoegTEHEPERO
[5:38:10] ninoegyn: and it affects him deeply
[5:38:17] Returner7: o7
[5:38:18] DokiDumpster: i mean did we watch 2nd cour? she was traumatic
[5:38:28] joic3r: the last really good isekai was 'here and there, then and there'
[5:38:29] kawaiicrew4ever: fair
[5:38:33] ninoegyn: like when he had to protect the forest village and his hesitation got the kid killed
[5:38:48] Playmer: I'm going through my section right now, and I definately _haven't_ watched/read a ton of stuff. Partly because I often switch to reading the LN when I like it. Only recently have I been trying to watch seasonal stuff.
