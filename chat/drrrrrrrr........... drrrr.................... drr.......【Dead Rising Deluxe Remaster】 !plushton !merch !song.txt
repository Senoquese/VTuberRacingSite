[4:41:15] Cronofuge: It was jank in 2006, too
[4:41:21] metaconstruct: ^^^
[4:41:30] RycegoZ: The issue is that DR2 added combo weapons which made it more fun, the game wants you to get creative with your playstyle
[4:41:30] demon_dandy: Its a specific type of thing you gotta feel ashton51Tehe
[4:41:49] ScholarofGames: I mean I'm one of those people
[4:41:52] ScholarofGames: I love Dead Rising.
[4:41:57] RycegoZ: I never said the Remaster was good, it's a failure of theOG

[4:44:01] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its ok you didnt vibe with it
[4:44:02] yojamjam: yes queen talk your shit on this slop
[4:44:04] Azlehria: You just don't vibe with DR's flavor of jank and meme-spawn? Completely fair.
[4:44:11] Cronofuge: The weird thing is that the game plays slow and clunky until you get to a high character level, but the clunkiness makes you not want to play to get to that level.
[4:44:11] T33bags: flashground on newgames
