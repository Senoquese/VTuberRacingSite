[0:39:05] demon_dandy: Oooooh smoovement
[0:39:38] beat_shobon: I think what's cool is that Jet Set Radio (and JSRF) was made by young developers with fresh ideas looking to express themselves. So it feels fitting that the series is followed up spiritually by another team of fresh minds, you can really feel it.
[0:39:54] justcerebro: it's so sick it's so sick I love this game

[0:54:41] MoraeDev: jumping off the lamp i guess

[0:57:58] sinnfulApe: Nowadays it is
[0:58:00] justcerebro: I like how JSR encourages making an optimal route so that you can graffiti with as little interruption as possible
[0:58:08] a_shybot: its weird, it was really popular but there hasnt been a new one till now ang133Thunk
[0:58:16] unluckylou_: I played it growing up but totally forgot about it
[0:58:21] beat_shobon: It is more exciting and satisfying doing successful tags when you're at risk of being caught
[0:58:35] MoraeDev: setting up a flag i see
[0:58:45] demon_dandy: ashton51Heh
[0:59:04] JTBun: I think JSR was only difficult because of how clunky and not great some of the mechanics were
[0:59:21] moush: so far it seems mostly a scavenger hunt
[0:59:22] justcerebro: ermmm skill issue?

[3:56:08] anonsama9001: have you noticed particular games or streams increase viewership?
[3:56:13] mushi_buns: ashton51Steer
[3:56:48] anonsama9001: y-yes
[3:56:48] Senoquese: we def noticed certain games attract certain audiences
[3:56:51] Senoquese: cough cough forza
[3:56:59] ReyJaggy: only forza streams lol
[3:57:18] Burr11: forza streams are so hot they attract the top 5% players in the world
[3:57:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: TBF your games that are high in viewership tend to be the ones you really REALLY love
[3:58:03] Burr11: oh so it's all just a clever strategy
[3:58:04] anonsama9001: fascinating
[3:58:19] JTBun: oh yeah!
[3:58:21] demon_dandy: Me sneakily inflating the statisitcs on ashtons katamari stream ashton51Tensai " hmmm curious ashton"

[3:59:27] demon_dandy: Boss doesnt pay me enough to look at the viewers ashton51Stare
[3:59:43] Senoquese: i think its because its easy for anyone to get a free shooter game and stream it, gotta make your stream unique for that, and being better than most is an easy way
[3:59:47] Burr11: yeah obsessing over views doesn't really work
[3:59:47] anonsama9001: oh yes sorry, didn't mean to overstep any bounds. was just genuinely curious
[3:59:54] demon_dandy: Its like thhat "dont worry kitten/  okie <3 " meme ashton51Omegalul

[4:02:15] ReyJaggy: she is boom bang body race queen not boom bang body statistician
[4:02:17] Senoquese: yeah its not you, its just twitch
[4:02:35] horribleham: The fact ashton has come so far without playing the algo game is a testament to her magnetism.
[4:02:37] ReyJaggy: Also they changed the partner system
[4:02:44] Senoquese: @horribleham ^^^^^^^^
[4:02:51] demon_dandy: Ashton casually destroyin this dude LMAK

[4:03:23] horribleham: boss fight? fr? That was so easy
[4:03:24] Senoquese: yeah theres no real need to look at stats if you dont wanna just feel worse about yourself
[4:03:28] TachikomaKURO: @demon_dandy Yeah, just saw that! yuriaLul

[4:04:11] ReyJaggy: Time to make her cry with love
[4:04:17] ReyJaggy: ashton51Love

[4:04:49] mushi_buns: ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[4:04:50] Burr11: i share your fan art and clips just because i like it
[4:04:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You were talking so i figured a nice sippy would be helpful
[4:05:00] noodsdood69: Bold of you to assume I didn't tell my grandma and extended family relatives about you B)
[4:05:15] demon_dandy: You are not immune to ashton  toxoplasmosis ashton51Smile
[4:05:33] JTBun: ashton is my GF ashton51Smile
[4:05:37] TachikomaKURO: I seriously think reaching success on streaming isn't set in stone and in certain rules. While numbers are important, focusing too much on that can make you unhappy. It's mostly a matter of time
[4:06:06] noodsdood69: Parasocial? CRINGE. Hit them with the "Have you ever heard of a Vtuber?" and went on from there
[4:06:06] JTBun: LMAO
[4:06:09] ReyJaggy: you did asked for more pitcrew parasocialism last time
[4:06:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Vtubers shouldnt be 1 joke
[4:06:16] demon_dandy: She also had to be quieter cause of her voice so that helped change her laugh i think ashton51Wibble
[4:06:20] Senoquese: you think this disease is a joke??? ashton51Wibble im DYING out here
[4:06:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: like you joked on twitter you lamented not streaming during covid cuz so many people got boosted numbers from that.
[4:06:52] JTBun: nah not your fault
[4:07:10] demon_dandy: I think you should blame us cause twitch peeps in here like ashton51Stare erm (jkjk)
[4:07:21] Burr11: lol
[4:07:27] Returner7: ooooo sounds like we need another Doc Marten stream??? ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[4:07:28] ReyJaggy: Youll catch your big break one of these days, i can feel!
[4:07:45] Burr11: i feel like there's no real science to it.. people just hit randomly.. there's so many good streamers that just haven't had that viral moment
[4:07:54] ReyJaggy: Doc marten Streamer edition
[4:08:16] Burr11: yeah you can't interact as much with so many people
[4:08:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Im glad ashi is current size cuz she will still react to me some times
[4:08:33] noodsdood69: Ashton cute, real facts
[4:08:34] demon_dandy: I mean i've always felt you were a natural for bein funny and charmin TehePelo not to glaze too much
[4:08:42] ReyJaggy: chat becomes a hivemind  at that point
[4:08:52] horribleham: @demon_dandy Turn her into a doughnut lol
[4:08:59] JTBun: She hates me ashton51Smile
[4:09:02] ReyJaggy: except that forza chatter that one time

[4:09:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I know you will strike it big and leave us behind and its ok. we will just be the gray haired chillas in the back and let some other people bask in your glory ashi.
[4:09:49] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[4:09:50] mushi_buns: I hope for the day ashton cant see us cuz chat is going so fast, even if it will break my chilla heart
