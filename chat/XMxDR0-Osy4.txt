[5:43:08] Senoquese: no no godzilla will just spawn on the island from what i saw
[5:43:44] JTBun: same franchise
[5:43:50] Senoquese: every trackmania is different, turbo is nice for beginners
[5:43:51] JTBun: spinoff game
[5:44:03] demon_dandy: I played apex again and the shop is so ass now 😿
[5:44:05] JTBun: nah it's good
[5:44:17] Senoquese: trackmania ( just trackmania ) is super monetized and locks out 99% of tracks except like the tutorial stuff ashton51Despair
[5:44:28] Senoquese: which is unfortunately the trackmania that has your ashton car skin
[5:44:42] demon_dandy: Its such a different game LOL
[5:44:58] Noworksm: Turbo is Trackmania 2, but was supposed to be the console version. Different aesthetics, but it's good. It's also hard as fuck at the end of the game.
[5:44:59] Senoquese: LOLLL im sorry
[5:45:08] Noworksm: Ubisoft published game sadly
[5:45:11] Senoquese: @Noworksm nuhh theres an actual trackmania 2
[5:45:14] Senoquese: this is like trackmania 3
[5:45:17] Senoquese: and barely at that
[5:45:22] demon_dandy: alright pull up binding of isaac
[5:45:23] 99d9: she gets in lol
[5:45:35] Senoquese: WHAT
[5:45:38] ApocalypseSC: bruh
[5:45:45] JTBun: no way
[5:45:49] ApocalypseSC: ashton51Despair
[5:45:55] demon_dandy: Did turbo go offline?
[5:46:05] Noworksm: All the cars are from TM2 (except Lagoon which got backported) and there's overlap in the tracks with 2.
[5:46:06] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: This is a stream of all time
[5:46:21] Senoquese: For some reason Steam is installing an older copy of the Ubisoft launcher from when it was called Uplay so it can't connct to the Ubisoft servers to create your account. Uninstall it and install a fresh copy the launcher Steam will just launch it since it installs to the same location
[5:46:23] Senoquese: ashton51Despair
[5:46:25] ApocalypseSC: did you have turbo already? i think the trackmania people play is just called trackmania
[5:46:26] BearerOfPeas: h... hi chillas
[5:46:35] eatsaduckimust: ifAshton crashGame
[5:46:35] Senoquese: @ApocalypseSC that ones not good for beginners
[5:46:46] ApocalypseSC: oh
[5:46:47] osuhdtv: the actual trackmania is published by ubisoft connected
[5:46:48] Senoquese: i bought turbo for you
[5:46:52] osuhdtv: u can download it by free
[5:47:01] ApocalypseSC: lol
[5:47:02] Senoquese: LOLLLL
[5:47:06] Kitkattack: oh jeez
[5:47:11] Kitkattack: she's just blaming anybody now
[5:47:16] Senoquese: the f2p trackmania is heavily monetized and will lock you out of any track thats not the tutorials ashton51Tehe
[5:47:28] Senoquese: NOOO
[5:47:30] demon_dandy: extra no dinner 👨‍⚖️
[5:47:40] ApocalypseSC: bad rats ashton51Bongo
[5:47:48] Senoquese: apparently you have to install uplay manually ashton51Tehe
[5:47:50] osuhdtv: if you download it per steam, steam will isntall ubisoft connect because its an ubisoft original.
[5:47:55] Kitkattack: that's crazy
[5:48:02] RycegoZ: Mouthwashing was good, just that the game filtered you
[5:48:04] demon_dandy: LOL
[5:48:07] BaneHallowed: same I hate mouth wash and the fans
[5:48:14] Kitkattack: it's a heavy story game, so what if it's a wwalking simulator
[5:48:16] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: You could but only once on stream
[5:48:43] StreamElements: I have my own flavor of AdvancedGG Energy available for purchase for a limited time!! Get your tub of Race Queen Ramune and don't forget your Ashton Marten shaker for a crisp refreshing summer with me! 🥤  https://advanced.gg/pages/partner-ashton-marten?ref=ashton
[5:48:43] BearerOfPeas: is it one of those games where they've reached the user limit?
[5:48:46] RycegoZ: Mouthwashing is this generation's "Life is Strange"
[5:48:54] Noworksm: mouthwashing is a depressed gory Always Sunny episode
[5:48:55] demon_dandy: okay but when you unhinge his jaw and he gasps dryly its got some juice
[5:49:10] BaneHallowed: based thank you Ashton, tell the truth
[5:49:19] demon_dandy: yeah LOL
[5:49:20] RycegoZ: She's hating a game she doesn't even remember
[5:49:27] analmcgoober: I did not think the plot was that great but I did like the reveal at the end that Curly was cool
[5:49:44] Kitkattack: I can't believe she's trying to downplay PEAM
[5:49:56] RycegoZ: Ashton must have a linear story for her smal chilla/marten brain
[5:50:13] RycegoZ: SWANSEA'S MONOLAGUE IS PEAK
[5:50:17] RycegoZ: DO NOT LIE
[5:50:28] king_okaze_ch: TIPS FEDORA
[5:50:32] phatscout: wait wtf you've been playing track mania for 5 hours???
[5:50:35] BaneHallowed: the fans are unhinged and attacked the main artist for drawing them a little bit lewd
[5:50:35] demon_dandy: Swansea riders 💀
[5:50:38] Kitkattack: it is kind of purple prose
[5:50:43] Matharu_: NOWAY the chilla is gonna pull a Wirtual ashton51Omegalul
[5:50:47] phatscout: Ash did you play Star wars Metallica?
[5:50:58] RycegoZ: @BaneHallowed Oh damn, yup that's a minor focused Fandom for you
[5:51:10] phatscout: or any of the other weird maps that were on the giantbonb tm2 server back in the day?
[5:51:12] demon_dandy: I mean if she didnt fw she didnt fw it ashton51Tehe
[5:51:36] analmcgoober: I like the game I'm not gonna fan out over it tho
[5:51:51] phatscout: If you're out playing trackmania on some fucked up custom server with 600 bizarre plugins playing ahit 2010 YouTube dubstep remix
[5:51:57] JTBun: you have to install it through Uplay
[5:52:01] Senoquese: ^^^^
[5:52:02] phatscout: you're not REALLY playing trackmania
[5:52:12] Matharu_: can't wait to hear on a video essay ""and then, Ashton got... this run.""
[5:52:15] JTBun: which trackmanaia?
[5:52:19] BaneHallowed: story was so meh
[5:52:23] demon_dandy: i did like how they did the in game bits  like the storage space or the vents
[5:52:24] Bird_toe: Most of my enjoyment of the story is from the messages it says. Particularly in how ignoring red flags can have consequences.
[5:52:26] JTBun: 202 won't be all the fun
[5:52:36] Noworksm: Trackmania is developed by Ubisoft Nadeo, so you're stuck with their launcher. Also, like EA and Origin, ubisoft did the same thing with Uplay
[5:52:38] JTBun: you'll have the tutorial levels and thats it
[5:52:40] phatscout: If you're not playing trackmania on some fucked up custom server with 600 bizarre plugins playing shitty 2010 YouTube dubstep remixes, you're not really playing trackmania
[5:52:43] StreamElements: Stream my first original song 『 RACING LINE 』 now! https://ffm.to/racingline (It's eurobeat!)
[5:52:45] Senoquese: yeah youre playing a demo basically ashton51Tehe you just have to update the uplay launcher on turbo
[5:52:56] JTBun: 2020
[5:53:05] demon_dandy: Its fun imo ashton51Tehe
[5:53:10] phatscout: Does the current trackmania have all the bizzare custom shit in it?
[5:53:12] demon_dandy: LOL
[5:53:15] Matharu_: KEKW
[5:53:18] Senoquese: @phatscout if you pay the subscription
[5:53:22] Matharu_: Turbo yippeee
[5:53:34] demon_dandy: They have like the seasonal maps right?
[5:53:38] Matharu_: ayo who's Supra is farting
[5:53:40] phatscout: @senoquese do you still have to use maniaplanet or whatever it's called
[5:53:50] Senoquese: @demon_dandy yeah if you dont pay you only get access to the tutorial and 1 seasonal campaign
[5:53:56] JTBun: @demon_dandy 2020 is great, but you pretty much gotta pay for the sub to get what you want out of the game
[5:53:56] phatscout: the messed up nadeo launcher that makes Uplay look like a normal thing
[5:54:14] Senoquese: @phatscout maniaplanet was only for the tm2 campaigns i think
[5:54:17] Matharu_: clicks on "Forgot Password" -> Type New Password -> "New Password can't be same as old password"
[5:54:32] phatscout: wait ash said she's playing tm turbo?
[5:54:49] phatscout: tm turbo is actually like the most normie friendly way to get into trackmania tbh

[5:58:04] JTBun: you can change keybinds
[5:58:13] JTBun: you can use WASD
[5:58:15] phatscout: The whole graphic design of this game was really cool
[5:58:16] keydget: use one keyboard for gas and the other for steering
[5:58:24] rikkaonline: "im using the wrong keyboard for this" -every 60% user ever
[5:58:26] Senoquese: senny responsible for WORST stream ever, forced to graduate as a viewer
[5:58:48] JTBun: those are just times you aim for
[5:58:52] demon_dandy: @senoquese 🔪 take responsibility
[5:58:56] demon_dandy: jkjk
[5:58:58] phatscout: The pop art wipeout esque thing they were going for in turbo is more interesting than the normal stadium shit trackmania goes for
[5:58:58] Senoquese: its just arrow keys
[5:59:08] Matharu_: ratJAM yuyixRave
[5:59:15] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: graduation as a viewer is too light of a punishment ashton51Squish
[5:59:20] keydget: I wish this one did better, but with the community they made with the others, I can see why they didn't take to it
[5:59:25] JTBun: drifting is just breaking and turn
[5:59:30] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[5:59:39] demon_dandy: Go for gold ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai

[5:59:56] Matharu_: get that Top 500 Illinois lol
[5:59:58] phatscout: Yeah it doesn't have an insane shadow internet in it like tm2 did
[6:00:10] airglowsaysHiMooniAndVctr: top 500 canada
[6:00:20] keydget: I wouldn't say baby mode, the other ones are very like uhh barebones
[6:00:26] rikkaonline: top 10 your apartment building

[6:01:19] phatscout: so trackmania is a time trial game except everyone's doing it at the same time
[6:01:19] demon_dandy: I think r for quick restart?
[6:01:22] JTBun: there you go
[6:01:29] Senoquese: its delete for restart and backspace for checkpoint
[6:01:34] Noworksm: Trackmania is different. You can stay on the power during drifts
[6:01:38] demon_dandy: Oh delete ashton51Tehe
[6:01:45] phatscout: Quick dumb question but does TM still force you into first person when you're in a loop?
[6:01:57] Senoquese: @phatscout yes, thats scripted in the actual loop block
[6:01:59] MowtenDoo: the only thing you need to know that isnr obvious is that if you tap break in midair it stops your car from rotating which is important
[6:02:16] jherchin12345: I like the sounds of keyboards
[6:02:21] Allch_Chcar: You can pull the ebrake too right? I figure this game doesn't have a clutch
