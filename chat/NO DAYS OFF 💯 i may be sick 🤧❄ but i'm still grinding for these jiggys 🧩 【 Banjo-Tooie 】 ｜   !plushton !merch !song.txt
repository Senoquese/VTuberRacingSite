[0:26:19] MetroIceberg: Hi, beautiful Marten!
[0:26:27] ApocalypseSC: I think it's good that streaming is still something you want to do and are capable of doing while feeling like that.
[0:26:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: LOL
[0:26:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we love a little girl rott
[0:26:52] Navy_Mongoose: so we should always beg you to stream?

[0:27:11] watercat2002: lumituPatto lumituPatto lumituPatto
[0:27:14] Senoquese: i do completely get that but is that a good excuse to wanna stream, i feel like youd develop a bad relationship w streaming over time because of that
[0:27:17] mrp0p1nfr3sh: What if pitcrew came over and did this ashton51Alien to you in your streaming room
[0:27:26] mrp0p1nfr3sh: being honest is good for us.
[0:27:28] Kitkattack: personally I clean like crazy about once a month, hopefully you find motivation at some point ashton51Alien
[0:27:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its because streaming comforts you
[0:27:53] VP_Jarhead: Does it keep your mind off of it
[0:27:53] mrp0p1nfr3sh: and doing work is just a larger task in your mind
[0:28:28] Senoquese: streaming less because you specifically felt like it and more as an alternative to something else
[0:28:40] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Despair
[0:28:41] Senoquese: is what i mean

[0:30:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Concrete walls. we cant live in them and chew your cables
[0:31:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its not complaining. you are being honest and your emotions are valid
[0:31:27] rikkaonline: if you want to push yourself to stream when you said you would even if you dont feel 100%, i say just go for it, because youre not going to get us to tell you to just stream anyways if you ask our opinion on those days
[0:31:35] Senoquese: @rikkaonline ^^^^

[1:14:32] Tyler_Likes_Cats: Considering this is a RareWare game, the inflation tube is probably meant to be phallic. There’s a part of this game where part of the geometry looks suggestive, on purpose.

[1:26:06] Gawayno: M+KB is my field in FPS.
[1:26:08] Senoquese: its weird to think this game took 2x as long to develop as the first and its not really much better.. hl1 came out between the two...
[1:26:09] CaptainJulibee: its even harder on the switch
[1:26:11] Gawayno: Hi @Kitkattack ! How are you?

[1:26:51] Navy_Mongoose: I do like how items continuously respawn in this
[1:27:03] CaptainJulibee: yeah!! I did both and switch is definitely harder to shoot than the original because of the way the controller is mapped for sensitivity
[1:27:12] chinwillach: Les gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[1:27:40] CaptainJulibee: the sneak missions are also harder on switch because of that
[1:27:42] Tyler_Likes_Cats: I got this for Christmas 2000 or 2001 on the N64. It’s rough for me to try to play this on the Switch controller now.
