[0:37:29] knmpog: hallo im here to spread propaganda on the marginal service
[0:37:49] stormy_halo: any example of cheap bad anime?
[0:37:50] demon_dandy: I did wanna watch marginal too LMAO
[0:37:56] knmpog: STOPP NOO ITS GOOOD
[0:38:29] ReyJaggy: which one?
[0:38:32] knmpog: I LOVE IT!!!!
[0:38:55] demon_dandy: Spy family was their latest but that one was high quality ashton51Tehe
[0:39:15] knmpog: MASHLE is one punch man-esque
[0:39:15] xscape1999: I love Mashle. I'm caught up with the manga
[0:39:17] ReyJaggy: ohhh the manga is hilarious
[0:39:22] MuttleyStrikeout: mashle is pretty funny, but it didnt hold me for long
[0:39:28] xscape1999: mashle is OPM with Harry potter
[0:39:36] plazynoodles: i remember watching a video of a guy that never read manga getting into manga and MASHLE was his first manga ever
[0:39:42] demon_dandy: I kinda wanna watch mashle but ill wait a bit i think
[0:39:43] horribleham: sounds like a manga I would like for like 20 chapters
[0:39:46] plazynoodles: like he was a literature teacher lmfao
[0:39:49] ReyJaggy: i read it late when there was sizeable amount of chapters
[0:39:50] stormy_halo: who is that for?
[0:39:57] Rotabrutsam: I want a parallel paradise anime adaption
[0:40:03] knmpog: it gets a chuckle here and there
[0:40:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They Buy 3 shit shows to afford 1 good show
[0:40:15] starchyfriend: @Rotabrutsam  alices18Sweat oh god, imagine
[0:40:36] MuttleyStrikeout: its shonen jump so its pretty mainstream
[0:40:44] demon_dandy: Mashle is pretty easy to market
[0:40:44] stormy_halo: the crunchiest anime rolls.
[0:40:50] knmpog: true. you can kinda turn off your brain
[0:40:54] plazynoodles: would you say they play it safe?
[0:40:57] gosher: isn't that the majority of their demographic though
[0:41:05] xscape1999: Mashle appeals to the One punch man fanbase and other Shonen Jump genres that are similar to Naruto and Black clover since they both have characters without talent of their respective magical power systems
[0:41:28] Rotabrutsam: am I delusional or do I think people treat anime like some kind of FOMO now?
[0:41:54] ReyJaggy: i dont think so
[0:41:56] demon_dandy: I feel like anime fomo was a lot worse before
[0:42:02] stormy_halo: i get fomo from twitter
[0:42:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Hot take one punch man is boring
[0:42:09] MuttleyStrikeout: if i dont start watching it now ill have to watch 500 episodes later
[0:42:11] knmpog: everyone but the Mash in MASHLE is ok looking ngl
[0:42:13] Playmer: I mean sometimes I watch stuff if I think I _might_ be interested and I think Twitter will spoil the shit out of it
[0:42:14] xscape1999: OPM has gotten 3 studio changes. Madhouse drew it, J.C Staff drew and now Mappa is doing it
[0:42:22] horribleham: I think there is always FOMO around current shows
[0:42:25] stormy_halo: yeah what Playmer said
[0:42:30] plazynoodles: i am not THAT much of a weeb so i literally just watch old ass anime and dont care about seasons
[0:42:32] MoraeDev: honestly murata and bones, madhouse, carried it so hard
[0:42:33] ReyJaggy: nowadays lots of peeps are picking up manga so no missing out
[0:42:47] MoraeDev: if the anime started with JC it wouldnt have end up this big
[0:42:51] plazynoodles: i will watch ranma 1/2 100 times before i care about anime seasons dhehjfcdsjfjs
[0:42:56] starchyfriend: there is a third season coming out i think..
[0:43:01] kawaiicrew4ever: LMFAO
[0:43:03] kawaiicrew4ever: anituber shade
[0:43:05] horribleham: LOL ASHTON. You can't say that
[0:43:06] Playmer: OPM's biggest issue is that the second season adapts like barely half of that arc
[0:43:08] kawaiicrew4ever: ashton51Kneel i kneel
[0:43:11] knmpog: 💀💀💀
[0:43:12] demon_dandy: I kinda fell off the manga too since they changed the webcomic story
[0:43:14] TheAsterite: ashton51Stare
[0:43:19] starchyfriend: ashton51Stare
[0:43:26] plazynoodles: ashton51Stare
[0:43:50] MoraeDev: cause webcomic has pretty much stopped in advance, at least one is still in charge with the remake plot anyway
[0:43:50] TheAsterite: the web comic was better than the manga anyway
[0:43:54] plazynoodles: sort of off topic but the one punch man overwatch collaberation was so random lmfao
[0:43:58] TheAsterite: sigbirdNerdbird
[0:43:59] stormy_halo: that's interesting
[0:44:09] starchyfriend: that entire sequence was great
[0:44:19] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah LMAO
[0:44:29] demon_dandy: Jojo is very panel for panel
[0:44:33] knmpog: 2nd season got plot
[0:44:48] MoraeDev: i never expected part 6 anime to come out that good
[0:44:57] stormy_halo: do you think there's like an "on season" and "off season" for anime? these spring anime don't seem to hook like winter anime did.
[0:45:08] Playmer: 2nd season _isn't_ as good, but it's not as big of a downgrade when you consider what it was adapting
[0:45:09] gosher: season 2 was pretty average production wise
[0:45:18] TheAsterite: it's more just 2022 was cracked on anime
[0:45:20] knmpog: its kinda average animation but its what we sacrifice for plot
[0:45:27] starchyfriend: the 2nd season was way more shaking jpegs and flashy lights than the first season of opm
[0:45:30] demon_dandy: LMAO last season was off season for sure
[0:45:32] MoraeDev: jojo part 6 is the biggest hit or miss in the whole series and the anime actually works much better than manga
[0:45:35] stormy_halo: i see
[0:45:46] demon_dandy: Yeye
[0:45:47] knmpog: (the marginal service)
[0:45:49] MoraeDev: i do recommend just watch the anime instead of reading manga
[0:45:50] Playmer: last season had 80000 gold so it was perfection
[0:45:56] stormy_halo: omg i guess chainsaw man really was fall...
[0:46:20] demon_dandy: The only show i remember hearin people talkin on was tomo chan lollll
[0:46:28] gosher: i think onimair was the only show i watched last season
[0:46:31] Playmer: Chillin in my 30s
[0:46:31] stormy_halo: onimai was good

[0:48:24] Playmer: It was very cute
[0:48:40] knmpog: ITS SPORTS
[0:48:42] MoraeDev: maybe because the pace goes so boring everytime tomo is on screen
[0:48:42] stormy_halo: haha
[0:48:49] demon_dandy: I read some of otonari no tenshi it seems pretty good but yeah its simple romcom with stand out kid chatacters iirc
[0:48:54] ReyJaggy: tenshi is LN thats why
[0:48:54] stormy_halo: thats probably how people feel when they watch idol vtubers too knenWink
[0:49:08] Playmer: I'm not sure I care about anything yet this season, we'll have to see

[0:51:28] knmpog: thats true
[0:51:50] MuttleyStrikeout: maybe its just hip with the kids?
[0:51:50] Rotabrutsam: How come crunchyroll didn’t pick up urusei yatsura
[0:51:54] stormy_halo: there are some striking covers here
[0:52:09] knmpog: maybe cuz MASHLE manga was popular?
[0:52:15] Playmer: sony pump that budget
[0:52:37] stormy_halo: "sick" and "twisted" tags? ashton51Pog

[0:54:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I dont think the japanese animation studios are coming to western companies its the other way around. The western distribution centers like netflix and hulu approach them.
[0:54:38] Playmer: @mrp0p1nfr3sh hidive is like 2 decades behind, worse than the 360 Netflix app
[0:54:43] stormy_halo: the membership is so cheap, how could they?

[0:55:40] Playmer: Crunchyroll is Sony
[0:55:48] Rotabrutsam: ARMS lol
[0:55:51] ReyJaggy: they want to be the netflix of anime
[0:55:53] Playmer: I mean I know they don't get the budget, but they are _also_ a billion dollar company
[0:56:20] demon_dandy: Shamoned ashton51Tehe
[0:56:26] stormy_halo: you're amazing ashton

[1:37:52] kawaiicrew4ever: the first episode is literally insane
[1:37:56] kawaiicrew4ever: it's so good
[1:38:00] kawaiicrew4ever: i cried twice
[1:38:09] stormy_halo: oshi no ko seems to tell a very novel story that could be really profoundly touching
[1:38:30] Senoquese: gonna head out, very eepy.. hope yall have some great discussions!!! ashton51Baby
[1:38:30] ReyJaggy: oshi no ko its good, let the doctor simp
[1:38:32] kawaiicrew4ever: there's a lotta manga readers that hype the first episode cuz they don't wanna spoil
[1:38:36] stormy_halo: just from the description there
[1:38:41] Rokros: It's a good thing I don't watch modern anime fftUronil
[1:38:42] starchyfriend: the further you get into the manga, the more it devolves into petty idol drama
[1:38:48] starchyfriend: and i just
[1:38:52] Rhou_0: I was hyped about it before reading. Now that I read all of it, I'm not sure how they'll end the season in a satisfactory point...
[1:38:58] stormy_halo: ah..
[1:39:03] germanidolgod: By default anything aidoru, I'm obligated to watch lest I lose my godhood xD

[1:39:58] horribleham: amaiumCheck
[1:40:02] starchyfriend: prisci37Pepelel what did they mean by this
[1:40:05] horribleham: What is going on in there?
[1:40:24] stormy_halo: stirring things up on twitter sounds possibly culturally contextual?
[1:40:45] germanidolgod: Stan culture at its finest
[1:40:53] kawaiicrew4ever: LOOOL
[1:40:55] starchyfriend: LOL
[1:40:57] Rhou_0: I was happy in my ignorance, now that I remember it I kinda hated it lol
[1:41:01] stormy_halo: yeah haha what a weird thing to soapbox
[1:41:08] demon_dandy: It felt a little out of nowhere ashton51Tehe
[1:41:13] kawaiicrew4ever: it's so funny seeing shit like twitter and discord get mentioned in his work
[1:41:21] gosher: the whole series is pretty cynical about stuff that i assume he doesn't like in those industries
[1:41:29] starchyfriend: mangaka ratio'ing idols on twitter through his story (based?)
[1:41:37] kawaiicrew4ever: CHUUNI
[1:41:42] kawaiicrew4ever: it is kinda chuuni isnt it
[1:41:58] germanidolgod: Seems kinda like how Zombieland Saga handles it; only a little less deftly?
[1:42:34] kawaiicrew4ever: the mountain climbing scene is so funny
[1:42:35] demon_dandy: I also feel like it drops big plot stuff then moves pretty quickly around it, no shmoils
[1:42:38] germanidolgod: I mean they're literally zombies; so that's what I drew from it at least.
[1:42:42] stormy_halo: do you think the idol industry is toxic? and if so do you think it should be changed?
[1:42:43] kawaiicrew4ever: the duality of being an idol fan
[1:42:48] starchyfriend: ^^^
[1:42:56] horribleham: nyehe he! That was a lie
[1:43:00] chico421: euphemism plot? Or actual plot?
[1:43:06] kawaiicrew4ever: @horribleham HAM NO
[1:43:07] mrp0p1nfr3sh: The idol industry is super predator
[1:43:14] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Predatory on the idols i mean
[1:43:18] Rotabrutsam: maybe it’s up for the reader to decide
[1:43:24] demon_dandy: I feel like thats a whole nother tangent ashton51Tehe
[1:43:35] kawaiicrew4ever: did you read ib instant bullet
[1:43:36] stormy_halo: that makes so much sense
[1:44:37] demon_dandy: Oh yeah oshi no ko spoilers now
[1:44:48] Rhou_0: Feels like someone who has a love/hate relationship with the idol culture and they decided to write a story to explore his thoughts
[1:44:53] kawaiicrew4ever: had a chills BatChest in that moment
[1:44:57] germanidolgod: This is gonna be an interesting one for me
[1:44:58] starchyfriend: but then it just kinda went off the rails
[1:45:08] starchyfriend: and that's when i stopped catching up
[1:45:24] demon_dandy: I feel like its someone who likes idol culture but does the bad stuff as admissions
[1:45:38] kawaiicrew4ever: im kinda scared about how the ending's gonna be executed
[1:46:10] ReyJaggy: ending is gonna be Ruby is haruhi and becomes god like ashton
[1:46:15] kawaiicrew4ever: it's all lies BatChest

[1:46:59] horribleham: Ashton is on the cutting edge of hating
[1:47:02] kawaiicrew4ever: did they skip aqua's interview? i thought that happened right at the beginning of the time skip
[1:47:03] germanidolgod: Required watching over here. I mean shit; what kind of idol god woul I be if I skipped it?

[1:49:04] ReyJaggy: but the dramaaaaaaaaaa

[2:20:36] stormy_halo: the level of analysis is amazing
[2:20:37] starchyfriend: the one thing i loved in the manga is how all his speech bubbles are squiggly and his text is written small
[2:20:44] stormy_halo: you can only get that in ashton's stream
[2:20:47] starchyfriend: but gradually as he gains confidence his speech bubbles become normal
[2:20:56] starchyfriend: ashton51Squish
[2:21:00] asilveras: no what are you talking abuot, he gave the girl her eraser once
[2:21:15] plazynoodles: those lame self insert male love interests suck when theyre so flat

[2:23:34] asilveras: Listen, Ouran host club and Gundam 00 set my tastes for anime
[2:23:38] stormy_halo: the profit incentive conflicting with the spirit of art
[2:23:41] niertlwal: i think that's at whole criticism of all mediums in general
[2:23:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: look at the societal tone tho. Japan has a BUNCH of lonely otaku's they want that wholesome dating connection anyway they can without dating.

[2:27:05] rikkaonline: good, save the best anime for the real weebs
[2:27:14] stormy_halo: haha yeah kakegurui is such a strange pivot point for our culture
[2:27:15] Rotabrutsam: netflix needs more gundam
[2:27:18] asilveras: Listen, I like kakegurui because it's just gambling yugioh
[2:27:24] asilveras: with horny

[2:33:59] asilveras: we got a j-drama, but it's been a while and I wouldn't mind it getting slightly changed for modern times.
[2:34:00] stormy_halo: they should put the japanese title above the romanized title like furigana is above kanji

[2:48:31] starchyfriend: they did it soooo dirty
[2:48:32] BNMotive: sigh* stop it with the Isekai guys
[2:48:33] kawaiicrew4ever: I was so mad when i watched this
[2:48:35] stormy_halo: that StarLink is stronger than expected
[2:48:45] kawaiicrew4ever: first season not the second
[2:48:46] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:48:51] Rhou_0: Same for me, loved the manga but anime was disapointing.
[2:49:02] demon_dandy: Wait whats this?

[2:49:45] ReyJaggy: Is isekai trash, op mc gets all girls

[2:50:58] stormy_halo: young boys attach super hard to mid anime like that
[2:51:03] stormy_halo: and then buy everything
[2:51:49] horribleham: It's sort of crazy how isekai has come so far that it's nearly indistinguishable from parody. Konosuba is basically just a normal isekai these days.
[2:52:04] demon_dandy: Ohhhhhh this show
[2:52:07] Booust: its good but i forgot everything about s1
[2:52:35] horribleham: The manga started off pretty strong in the manga, but it fell off.

[2:59:54] justcerebro: watched the first episode with some other people and it was whatever tho, shite adaptation
[3:00:02] stormy_halo: the best hits usually have low ratings because the people who watched them weren't the target demo
