[0:17:44] spacechannel4: Ashton one day.. sim & racing wheel set up LUL SeemsGood
[0:17:47] AkaiHomura: if you dont know how to tune, just make everything rwd, and add power, all drift parts
[0:18:10] HatsBi: what no why would you think that? LUL
[0:18:23] AkaiHomura: 4wd gives you the most points, but pretty boring imo,
[0:18:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: AWD is easier to control drifts
[0:18:36] HatsBi: ....
[0:18:47] AkaiHomura: i actually took longer to learn awd, since i'm used to the rwd countersteer
[0:18:48] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they are in this game
[0:18:48] Nullamm: kinda
[0:18:56] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BUT awd and 4wd are different IRL
[0:18:58] HashiriyaR32: There's multiple types of 4WD
[0:18:58] rikkaonline: there is not a single objective difference between the two
[0:19:21] rikkaonline: often its said awd is always on and 4wd is toggleable
[0:19:27] mrp0p1nfr3sh: in this game tho its the same shit.
[0:19:32] rikkaonline: but there are comapnies that use the terms differently
[0:19:41] Nullamm: that's the differential, it's what splits the power
[0:19:42] AkaiHomura: i dont understand either, i think differential is what cause all wheels to be equal
[0:19:46] Senoquese: forza time!!!
[0:19:53] HashiriyaR32: I think I'll go over this in your discord maybe tommorrow night.
[0:20:00] Senoquese: cant wait to see raytracing being turned back on so you have to restart
[0:20:06] rikkaonline: youll never have all wheels exactly the same unless you have a locked diff and thats something different lol
[0:20:13] Nullamm: all cars have differentials. unless they only power one wheel

[0:24:57] Nullamm: The cars are real. well idk if there is an electric corvette
[0:24:59] rikkaonline: theyre real cars, just the corvette has been converted to an ev
[0:25:01] Nullamm: but the model is real

[0:25:48] HashiriyaR32: Bye bye Miss American Pie, drove my Chevy to the leevee but the leevee was dry~
[0:25:48] rikkaonline: my sister had a barbie corvette power wheels. it was a c4
[0:25:48] Nullamm: it's what EV's sound like
[0:25:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: thats what electric vehicles sound like
[0:25:56] Nullamm: it's Electric
[0:26:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: This is her car in the movie
[0:26:10] chico421: no, this is EV converted
[0:26:14] vauqueIin: the first gen corvette had a regular gas engine, sounded like a typical straight six of the time
[0:26:23] Kitkattack: For a second I thought it would be a modern Corvette
[0:26:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: this isnt the real corvette its scalled down to be barbie car sized
[0:26:31] Senoquese: theyre the perfect predator ashton51Pog
[0:26:35] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cuz she sticks out in the movie
[0:26:36] Nullamm: Yep. they had the same issues with electric trams in the 1800's
[0:26:40] vauqueIin: new electric cars and some hybrids are supposed to play a sound outside so you know they're coming
[0:26:47] rikkaonline: the original corvette actually wasnt great
[0:26:50] DatBoiVLC: Fun fact: mowing down little kids actually IS illegal
[0:26:54] JTBun: not even little kids, normal adults too
[0:26:57] Playmer: We really need to discourage huge trucks and trucks in general
[0:27:02] Nullamm: they've tried regulation noises to announce it. but that kinda defeats on of the 'benefits' of the EV
[0:27:28] rikkaonline: evs only need to make speed up to like 25mph, beyond that most of the noise is the tires on the road anyways
[0:27:38] Nullamm: quiet = better. if you believe consumer analyzers
[0:27:38] AkaiHomura: imagine being able to drive like forza on streets irl, no cops and no1 cares if you break every street low
[0:27:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it is but like borla makes speakers for EVs to sound loud AF
[0:27:43] Nullamm: personally, I like the noise
[0:27:55] imjucario: Heyyoooo mixiepMetadance mixiepMetadance
[0:27:57] Kitkattack: 6ton box trucks is a way different class
[0:28:00] vauqueIin: i think this model year didn't even have seatbelts
[0:28:01] Senoquese: it sounds like a drill
[0:28:06] AkaiHomura: for some reason its a festival but everyone drives like normal
[0:28:07] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah this car is fucking fiberglass it woulda exploded into fiberglass shards

[0:35:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: No this is EV swapped
[0:35:09] Nullamm: you'd have to convert it
[0:35:11] rikkaonline: some people convert old cars
[0:35:12] JTBun: im sure someone has
[0:35:25] anonsama9001: @Nullamm how much would that cost?
[0:35:25] ToroRosso: no, because it will never pass safety inspection
[0:35:39] DatBoiVLC: I can't wait until batteries get small enough that we can retrofit almost any car
[0:35:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: but also i think this version of the vette is like 75% smaller than the real Corvette cuz its based on the barbie movie corvette which isnt a real corvette but its scaled properly to a barbie toy.
[0:35:53] rikkaonline: in most states old cars are exempt from modern safety rules
[0:35:56] Nullamm: @anonsama9001 No idea, but some guy did it to an old plymouth gtx? There's a vid about it
[0:36:06] demon_dandy: Mater is a sufficient enough name ashton51Smile
[0:36:19] ToroRosso: Unless they drastically change the safety of the car which it will look way different from what it looks
[0:36:25] JTBun: lmao really
[0:36:28] JTBun: no way
[0:36:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @ToroRosso also yes ev's pass inspection. there are 3 classic porsche's that are EV swapped in my car club in california. so yeah its easily able to be done.

[0:37:20] vauqueIin: even if it's not road legal you can still drive it on private property and racetracks, as long as you tow it there
[0:37:21] ToroRosso: @mrp0p1nfr3sh it's different when it comes user modded then manufacturers making a new one

[0:42:01] rikkaonline: in real cars you dont usually instantly peg the gad or wheel like you do in game
[0:42:06] rikkaonline: gas
[0:42:12] Nullamm: Old boats can handle like that. and alot of cars have safety features and controls that are either turned off or disabled in game
[0:43:10] Nullamm: if it was made after 2006-ish it probably had those features. maybe even earlier. ABS and ESC or any kind of traction control is pretty big
[0:43:10] HashiriyaR32: It's probably just ABS and maybe traction control for your old Subie.
[0:43:12] JTBun: yeah
[0:43:16] Nullamm: maybe even required?
[0:43:21] HashiriyaR32: Yeah drum& bass

[0:49:54] bear_up_a_tree: I saw a video once where they explained that a 70mph crash in a smart car the car would still be drivable, but your organs would be liquid.
[0:49:54] HashiriyaR32: I suggest skipping this for now.  When we convoy up I can lead you to where the barn is in this zone.
[0:49:55] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Ashton would child lock us in the back of her dodgy Subaru while she puts it in gear then drops a brick on the gas pedal to launch it off a cliff with us inside.
[0:50:11] flickmannss: tree ded
[0:50:11] Nullamm: you can also cheat and use the drone to find it
[0:50:21] Senoquese: as an expert in animating ashton car crash scenes, i wouldnt mind animating you getting absolutely wrecked
[0:50:26] chico421: iirc they dont even get in the car, they floor it with a brick, throw it in drive and the car is guided along a rail to the cliff
[0:50:31] demon_dandy: I do like those tiktoks where the guy is watchin a gta wreck and like explaining how he survives "in this part im at the back of the car, the passengers are my cushion"
[0:50:31] Nullamm: Yes

[0:50:35] horribleham: ashton51Steer uh oh, she remembered what she wants to do to us.
[0:50:36] bear_up_a_tree: You gotta use the drone 100% to ding the barns.
[0:50:37] HashiriyaR32: I think drone is locked behind a house
[0:50:38] flickmannss: ah true, from the pause menu
[0:50:46] anthechamp8932: I barely use that drone

[2:50:36] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you have to turn off your PC windows doesnt dump memory and it writes excessively to your SSD
[2:50:37] Nullamm: you have to change an option to actually turn it off
[2:50:37] Senoquese: yeah win 10 shutdown keeps it on a lite sleep mode

[2:52:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: if its like a minute then you should worry
[2:52:15] Returner7: @Burr11 it's a hibernate not a sleep, the contents of the ram get dumped on your boot disc, if you have a slower ssd or hdd it may take longer
[2:52:18] Burr11: i feel like if it was actually only a sleep it'd be instant lol

[2:58:09] rikkaonline: both braking and turning require traction, your wheels only have so much to go waround
[2:58:13] arcticsnail61: @anonsama9001 prayersLOL
[2:58:17] Returner7: fortunately that's also how it works irl
[2:58:43] demon_dandy: Nice turns boss, clean race ashton51Baby

[3:00:25] anthechamp8932: maybe next time you invite us Ash
[3:00:30] TheAsterite: the secret to drifting in this game is making sure the traction control is off lol
[3:00:46] phatscout: oh no I just mean people trying to explain line
[3:00:47] demon_dandy: It is self gratifying i bet
[3:00:52] arcticsnail61: I saw u because I never see vtubers playing xbox brand games sarkLul prayersSadcat

[3:01:14] anthechamp8932: see u guys next time
[3:01:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: cya champ
[3:01:26] anthechamp8932: bye ^w^
[3:01:28] Nullamm: it kinda stops the drift, but doesn't seem to be doing that even for some reason
[3:01:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Senoquese OMFG WHY DO YOU WANT TO BUY HER STINK!?
[3:01:34] Burr11: gamepass is a good way to have a bunch of stuff to play for streams though

[3:01:49] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I keep traction control on and can drift
[3:01:52] Senoquese: @mrp0p1nfr3sh LMFAO NO HEY WAIT HUH
[3:01:55] mrp0p1nfr3sh: yes
[3:01:55] Nullamm: No
[3:01:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: dont turn it off
[3:02:06] phatscout: no you need less traction if you wanna get sideways
[3:02:06] Nullamm: well give it a try
[3:02:14] Nullamm: drive with it off, see if you lock it
[3:02:18] HashiriyaR32: uh, braking line back to "Braking Only"?
[3:02:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it will make regular racing harder than shit
[3:02:19] flickmannss: you don't look so sure about it LUL
[3:02:19] Burr11: i can drift with traction control too but it should make drifting easier to do
[3:02:19] Nullamm: like it*
[3:02:20] phatscout: yeah and wheelspin is what you want to drift
[3:02:23] rikkaonline: traction control off will make keeping control any other time difficult
[3:02:29] phatscout: TBH they should let you set up ABS/TC per car
[3:02:32] phatscout: instead of a global setting
[3:02:35] arcticsnail61: Chat is fighting leaflitAngry leaflitGao
[3:02:35] HashiriyaR32: I think you accidentally turned on FULL driving line
[3:02:36] rikkaonline: youll be good at drifting because youll be sliding whether you want to or not
[3:02:42] eye_raj: 😈
[3:02:47] Burr11: traction control should just be a key or something
[3:02:53] Nullamm: also manual gearing gives you more control. picking gear works wonders
[3:02:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Arent you gonna do tub stream? ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish ashton51Squish
[3:02:59] flickmannss: oh this one's a banger
[3:03:02] phatscout: try to formula drift cars if you want to uncontrollably slide
[3:03:03] Nullamm: E brake
[3:03:04] TheAsterite: now ebrake and turn
[3:03:06] Nullamm: see that
[3:03:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its because you are in an AWD car. Swap to a car thats RWD and you will notice it more
[3:03:19] demon_dandy: Nice drift boss er i think ashton51Baby
[3:03:28] phatscout: you need to modulate your throttle
[3:03:29] Nullamm: eiter or. it's up to your skill
[3:03:29] Burr11: turn then slam brake
[3:03:35] Nullamm: either or*
[3:03:41] arcticsnail61: The toyota supra is an excellent drift car
[3:03:47] Returner7: LOL, one of these days one of us will take you to a real track day and teach you, it will make things a lot clearer
[3:03:49] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:03:55] flickmannss: dayum you smoked thos tires ashton51Pog
[3:03:55] TheAsterite: you just want to tap the e-brake to start the drift, then let off
[3:03:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the GTR is awd
[3:04:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: you need RWD if you are learning
[3:04:02] phatscout: yeah the supra is easy to learn with
[3:04:05] phatscout: and you start with it
[3:04:06] mrp0p1nfr3sh: DB5 would be good
[3:04:10] Burr11: yeah ebrake drift is easier to start
[3:04:12] nq_chickieboo: wait do u have the vulcan?
[3:04:21] demon_dandy: cupra LMAO
[3:04:24] Nullamm: ABS off will also 'teach' you to brake, because if you just slam it, the wheels will just lock up and you'll slide into a wall
[3:04:42] demon_dandy: The brawnco ashton51Kneel ashton51Kneel

[3:14:16] horribleham: Sorry Seno. I'm going to have to make a callout post
[3:14:17] demon_dandy: Madmartens knowledge acquired ashton51Tensai
[3:14:23] Senoquese: @horribleham LMAO

[3:15:27] demon_dandy: Thars my OOMFIE RAHHH ashton51Wah
[3:15:29] TheAsterite: yeah, actually driving with traction control off is harder
[3:15:36] Returner7: did they make a hard top convertible beetle?
[3:15:36] Senoquese: yeah im a good furry i talk about feet like a normal person
[3:15:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I SAID THAT! LMAO
[3:15:46] Burr11: ashton51Omegalul
[3:15:47] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:15:54] Nullamm: Yep
[3:15:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: EVERYONE KEPT TELLING YOU TO DO IT
[3:16:04] Burr11: gotta slow down more
[3:16:09] TheAsterite: because she wanted to drift
[3:16:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You need to slow down more
[3:16:12] phatscout: quick question: Does "Sim Steering" even do anything in FH5
[3:16:12] TheAsterite: ashton51Smile
[3:16:17] barfchan: ashton51Steer
[3:16:19] Returner7: it's a double edge sword, traction control off & ABS off will teach good technique, but is very punishing
[3:16:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @phatscout NO
[3:16:20] AkaiHomura: you dont have to hit ebrake, slow down before corner let off brake while turning
[3:16:21] flickmannss: just keep braking ashton51Smile
[3:16:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it does nothing
[3:16:24] TheAsterite: you don't want to drift on these turns
[3:16:30] demon_dandy: Im sure its fun phatscout ashton51Tehe
[3:16:31] Nullamm: @phatscout yes, it changes how the weight shifts. I think
[3:16:33] barfchan: no turn signal fufuDrama
[3:16:38] mrp0p1nfr3sh: SHE DID IT
[3:16:39] Burr11: oh ok that works
[3:16:40] phatscout: @mrp0p1nfr3sh yeah in 4 is was like insanely sensitive but in 5 it feels exactly the same
[3:16:41] Senoquese: YOOOOO
[3:16:42] TheAsterite: drifting is generally slower
[3:16:45] Nullamm: it does something, but I don't know exactly how to explain it
[3:16:51] demon_dandy: Nice nice ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[3:17:00] AkaiHomura: aim for the inside of the markers you got to stay in, perfect race line is if you hit them
[3:17:06] Senoquese: tapy brake
[3:17:08] Burr11: brake more and drift earlier
[3:17:20] Burr11: bye guardrails
[3:17:21] flickmannss: ashton51Omegalul
[3:17:23] AkaiHomura: drifting sows you down in corners since you dont have speed out
[3:17:27] barfchan: average porsche driver
[3:17:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: THIS CHILLA IS COSTING TTHE COUNTRY OF MEXICO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DESTROYING THEIR ROADS LMAOO
[3:17:46] Nullamm: out in out. Racing line
[3:17:47] Returner7: ashton51Spin ashton51Spin ashton51Spin
[3:17:52] Burr11: i dunno if she's trying to do it smoothly or just drift it though haha
[3:17:56] barfchan: yet ashton51Smile
[3:18:02] AkaiHomura: it hasnt wrapped around a tree because of all the rewinds
[3:18:15] Baked_Snake: It snows in Colima
[3:18:24] demon_dandy: Ohhh i get it ashton51Tensai I think on the drift, right after you hit the brake and go into a spin, you wanna hit accelerate and activate your zipper boost right as you hit the speed pad, advanced stuff
[3:18:30] arcticsnail61: @barfchan at least she's not hellcat driver
[3:18:30] TRCGstream: ITS FRIDAY BABY!!!
[3:18:32] Nullamm: lel
[3:18:32] barfchan: LOL
[3:18:33] AkaiHomura: lol

[3:19:37] demon_dandy: You def getting better ashton51Baby
[3:19:39] Senoquese: yeah wtf!!! you should look at the earliest forza streams you have

[3:19:54] Returner7: yes you're actually using your brake pretty efficiently now! ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[3:19:58] mrp0p1nfr3sh: but it takes time
[3:20:00] Burr11: GRID and DIRT are also fun simmy racers
[3:20:01] horribleham: Best way to get better is to drive really fast irl. Remember, red lights are suggestions.
[3:20:01] Senoquese: figuring out the controls is also part of getting better!!!!
[3:20:05] akai_shotzi: Hello!
[3:20:15] AkaiHomura: you should let off gas when braking
[3:20:21] flickmannss: ^
[3:20:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: So that was last race yeah?
[3:20:25] Burr11: you should let off the gas when braking if you dont want to drift
[3:20:26] demon_dandy: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[3:20:39] TheAsterite: gotta slow down first, then drift tho
[3:20:43] Senoquese: ashton if you speed irl please stay away from any chilla families
[3:20:43] akai_shotzi: Just like the geneva checklist
[3:20:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yeah when drifting we dont lift off. but when we race We let off
[3:20:54] Returner7: lol do an irl track day and you'll understand!
[3:21:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You dont ask!
[3:21:08] AkaiHomura: if you drift its best to work clutch. you still got to let off to not spin
[3:21:12] Burr11: hahah driving is an art form
[3:21:13] phatscout: what controller are you using?
[3:21:21] Nullamm: oversteer understeer lock up turn in
[3:21:26] Nullamm: summon the demon of driving
[3:21:30] Returner7: yes irl go karts is good too as long as you got a good teacher
[3:21:35] flickmannss: I drive (2011)
[3:21:36] AkaiHomura: i'd definitely go go karting with ashton irl.
[3:21:41] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I have done a track day at the BMW experience track and it helps when you feel the car shmovin ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[3:21:43] Senoquese: no ashton watch out, the gokart has a mirror facing directly towards yoru face!!!
[3:21:44] phatscout: yeah so when you're drifting, try just putting like half the gas
[3:21:55] phatscout: the amt of gas determines your angle
[3:22:05] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[3:22:07] Returner7: put simply irl drifting = less traction & slower
[3:22:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Most go kart tracks do instruction classes for learning race lines
[3:22:08] akai_shotzi: Just don't do the money shift
[3:22:20] AkaiHomura: i can imagine ashton would be a fun date to go to a parking lott with a sports car to do donuts with
