[2:06:57] timinator193: just dice and quarters
[2:07:05] mage_mw: i heard it a lot during my brothers graduation ceremony
[2:07:07] Navy_Mongoose: Dice game, 3 dice that determine if your money goes Left, Right, or to the Center. Eventually one player wins all the money
[2:07:09] demon_dandy: ashton51Alien ashton51Alien ashton51Alien
[2:07:28] Chichcan: chiitoitsu or chiitoi is 7 pairs

[2:07:50] Navy_Mongoose: yup
[2:07:53] Navy_Mongoose: the house always wins
[2:07:53] rikkaonline: the point of a casino is to take your money
[2:07:56] JTBun: thats the point
[2:07:59] phloeh: counting cards is the only way to even the odds since the casino always wins if you tie
[2:08:01] JTBun: welcome to gambling
[2:08:04] TheAsterite: The point of a casino is to lose money to the house
[2:08:05] KyuuMJ: One of my mahjong club members is legally banned from the casino for card counting.
[2:08:05] jackstephendedalus: mahjong the most logical game
[2:08:16] HmmHrmHarumph: if you were able to be good casino's would be broke
[2:08:16] timinator193: They don't like it because it works
[2:08:16] vtuberacingcorp: That's illegal (not really, I think)
[2:08:20] Navy_Mongoose: also Discord Movie Night "Casino" when
[2:08:25] mage_mw: @KyuuMJ i was just telling melvin that lmao
[2:08:27] timinator193: they can just kick you out to not lose money
[2:08:28] TheAsterite: Isn't not getting caught card counting its own game?
[2:08:33] demon_dandy: Flirt
[2:08:35] GolfTermBirdie: ashton marten said what...
[2:08:36] TheAsterite: Make it more subtle
[2:08:39] MelvinSoupreme: @KyuuMJ my goat
[2:08:40] jackstephendedalus: that's why most tables have like 5 deck shoes now
[2:08:47] JTBun: they also make it much hard to count cards because they have a lot more than 1 deck shuffled at once
[2:09:00] Navy_Mongoose: iirc it's kind of impossible to count cards anymore due to the dealers just changing the decks and using automatic shufflers
[2:09:03] jackstephendedalus: no yaku who care
[2:09:22] jackstephendedalus: exhaustive draw w
