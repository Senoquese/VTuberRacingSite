[1:19:06] GManx0: It did at the start, Now it is their own thing everywhere
[1:19:13] ScarletRook: I still think it was weird learning about how someone impersonated a clipper for offkai one year
[1:19:58] Senoquese: that theory sounds insane
[1:20:01] Burr11: Lol I believe that conspiracy
[1:20:06] SidewinderZero: Clippers legit helped me get more acquainted with Vtubers after I fell off of watching them for a while
[1:20:07] demon_dandy: Its kinda fun when i recognize a clipper/fan artist just pop into these communities
[1:20:09] ScarletRook: Yeah if its a group focused clipper its easier to learn the in jokes and culture of the streamers
[1:20:19] T33bags: clippers in the streaming sphere have been existent since the early 2010s and they were mostly notorious rather than famous because they would fester on sub reddits live livestreamfails to drama bait
[1:20:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I kinda like the fact that JP Vtubers are starting to warm up to western clippers and interacting with western viewers.
[1:20:39] GManx0: Where are your clippers

[1:21:21] a_shybot: its not authentic FeelsWeirdMan
[1:21:36] ScarletRook: Yeah they know how to make their streamer shine the best
