[3:47:43] HmmHrmHarumph: I think there's two breakers
[3:48:01] ReyJaggy: ashton51Sus

[3:55:16] FourmyleStream: Nah, I think you still gotta flip the breakers
[3:55:26] FourmyleStream: but the readout on the left'll show the values anyway

[4:12:26] TheAsterite: yes, but also mario 64 was too
[4:12:49] Bird_toe: I prefer the puzzles in Riven because they are more closely tied to the world building, so they felt less obtuse
[4:12:50] Dhekranh: oh, I know of mario 64, but it was slighly different, you started playing as Yoshi IIRC
[4:12:57] HmmHrmHarumph: nah
[4:13:16] TheAsterite: that's what separated this from sierra games
[4:13:24] yojamjam: she yearns for metroid
[4:13:24] Iz_zl: when did Myst become 3D? olivia50Think
[4:13:29] Senoquese: its true
[4:13:40] yojamjam: sm64 ds you do start as yoshi. you get hats to transform into plumbers
