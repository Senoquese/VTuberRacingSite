[2:01:19] knightlyvan: hmm maybe it’s a pressure thing then
[2:01:26] RobotFaker: I guess it spreads out the pain rather than being in one single point?
[2:01:30] JTBun: "on topic"

[2:07:14] Erjoc: light gun games were way more engaging for me
[2:07:15] DatBoiVLC: I used to play mostly wangan and DDR at the arcade, same as today
[2:07:16] mrp0p1nfr3sh: i did at nickel nickel!
[2:07:17] horribleham: That is true, one time I had a job weed whacking an entire hill and at the end of the day it was hard to uncurl my fingers. The vibration actually does something to them.

[2:07:45] RobotFaker: I didn't like the arcade version growing up because it was a stand up cabinet and I couldn't see the screen that well trying to hold the wheel and press the pedal
[2:07:50] demon_dandy: LMAO
[2:07:51] Red__2: Try phasing through the buildings it should work

[2:09:23] Senoquese: i spent so much money on round one's coin pushers so i could get the big greasy plushies on the top shelves
[2:09:24] 6rats_ina_sack: LUL it's california they'd rather drive around the block 500 times looking for a parking spot than walk two blocks
[2:09:27] JTBun: yes
[2:09:28] horribleham: yep
[2:09:28] demon_dandy: I had a MASSIVE underground arcade as a kid and the fighting game section was so buff LOL

[2:10:24] Red__2: Finally my obsession with lupin can pay off
[2:10:25] DrummingOni: that’s Cliffhanger
[2:10:32] Red__2: Years of training for this
[2:10:34] gatorafan: Is that official?
[2:10:38] DrummingOni: it’s Cagliostro’s and Mystery of Mamo scenes
[2:10:45] lleecchh: good movie
[2:10:55] DrummingOni: I’m a Lupin fan
[2:11:05] tnurg__: no sermon today
[2:11:06] Senoquese: doing better gives you more time bonuses
[2:11:09] RobotFaker: no church pensive
[2:11:29] Senoquese: apparently the bike is in this version, "Just press L+R 3 times and select your cabbie. You'll hear a bicycle chime when done correctly."
[2:11:42] RobotFaker: @Senoquese can confirm
[2:11:50] DatBoiVLC: I think the closest thing I've been to galloping ghost would have to be castles n coasters in Phoenix
[2:11:56] DrummingOni: cliffhanger and Lupin are the same. the US changed his name to cliffhanger
[2:11:59] DatBoiVLC: they have an OG digdug with the wheel
[2:12:09] DrummingOni: it’s like Dragon’s Lair

[2:12:31] HmmHrmHarumph: I love the Dragon's Lair slander
[2:12:32] Red__2: I wanna know who came up with that concept and also got it approved for disc release
[2:12:34] Sonathesweet: OMG! it's CRAZY TAKI!
[2:12:41] TheAsterite: night trap seems like a very weird game to be so controversial for the time
[2:12:50] Senoquese: oh you have to do it before you select him
[2:12:52] DrummingOni: that hanging scene is from The Mystery of Mamo.
[2:12:56] RobotFaker: ah you do it before you sele-yeah
[2:12:58] hottungsten: @DatBoiVLC Phoenix has starfighter arcade. I think like 200 games and theyre all free play
[2:13:00] Sonathesweet: It is my personal belief that you should never play this game without pedals and steering wheel controller
[2:13:19] DatBoiVLC: @hottungsten I moved out of Phoenix like 6 or 7 years ago now, is that new?
[2:13:19] Sonathesweet: Because I grew up with the Arcade

[2:20:41] HashiriyaR32: My first experience with Crazy Taxi was with the DC version of the second game, and I played it with the V3 FX Wheel that made it easy to do Crazy Dash and Crazy Drift, because the wheel's shifting buttons were +/- on both the left and right spokes so I could quickly change between drive and reverse with either thumb.
[2:20:50] Senoquese: oh true
[2:21:11] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Ashton is the only lady in Virtual Vacation that can drive. Lets hope she gets them to the popcorn store and fila store BEFORE the venue.

[2:40:27] Burr11: drift and boost tricks
[2:40:31] RubyRose2077: it does get old fast, it's the same thing over and over, the only good thing about the gamecube version is there is a 10 minute version that would give you enough time to make it downtown
[2:40:31] Senoquese: To quickly accelerate, press the drive gear button (B) the same time as you press the accelerate trigger (R). To quickly stop, press the reverse gear button (A) at the same time as you press the Break trigger (L).
[2:40:33] JTBun: yup
[2:40:35] peachuuuu: drifting and boosting on it
[2:40:37] Erjoc: they both require you to swap between reverse and gas at certain timee
