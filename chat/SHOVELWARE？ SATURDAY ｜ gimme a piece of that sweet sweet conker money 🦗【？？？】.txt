[3:00:36] ArdenYves: tobsWICKED2
[3:00:58] LoboSix_: it's like an obscure game
[3:01:55] demon_dandy: shovel where? cause i dig it ashton51Tensai
[3:02:16] phatscout: yeah there was a whole ass peroid of "even EDGIER edgy animal platformer mascots" like uh... Vexx and Whiplash
[3:02:24] phatscout: and Shadow the Hedgehog
[3:02:46] phatscout: like the "sonic wasn't edgy even, these dudes are even MORE edgy"
[3:02:53] phatscout: trend
[3:02:56] demon_dandy: its all cause youre so charmin ofc TehePelo
[3:03:05] phatscout: *edgy enough
[3:03:15] demon_dandy: WOAH DIAGONAL JUMP ashton51Pog
[3:03:21] phatscout: the real question is if Jak 2 counts as part of that way
[3:03:35] demon_dandy: shes cracked ashton51Tensai
[3:03:40] phatscout: no as in the sequel to jak and daxter
[3:03:43] ArdenYves: i played the hell out of tak
[3:03:53] demon_dandy: tak and the power of juju
[3:03:59] LoboSix_: speaking of animal mascots, y'all remember ty the tasmanian tiger?
[3:04:00] ArdenYves: the power of juju yea LOL
[3:04:07] phatscout: slightly??
[3:04:41] phatscout: iirc the devs of these did one of the ps1 froggers and then konami decided to do their own take on it
[3:04:54] phatscout: there was a frogger PS2 platformer that was REAL fuckin bad
[3:04:56] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe he was pretty ugs
[3:06:28] phatscout: yeah this studio did Frogger 2 on PS1, this got rejected by Konami in favor of "Frogger: The Great Quest"
[3:06:43] phatscout: which IS genuinely shovelware, just absolutely garbage
[3:06:44] demon_dandy: oh this is a very crash bandicoot section
[3:07:09] CINO_p: jesus whats up with that bird
[3:07:40] phatscout: my hot take is that crash was never really a "animal with tude" type because he was too... wacky for that
[3:07:52] demon_dandy: cowboy hat nyooo pickychWah
[3:08:33] phatscout: I'm pretty sure these guys made House of the Dead Overkill
[3:08:42] phatscout: the wii one that had the most cureses in a game for a good while
[3:09:02] demon_dandy: apparently these guys made bad boys for the ps2 if you know that
[3:09:14] ArdenYves: jeanfa1Packjam
[3:09:35] phatscout: i know it got a 1 out of 5 on xplay iirc
[3:09:36] demon_dandy: this a banger omg
[3:10:02] phatscout: no Bad Boys Miami Takedown
[3:10:07] phatscout: got a 1 out of 5
[3:10:24] demon_dandy: yeah IT IS a funny ps2 game, bad boys
[3:10:35] phatscout: as in bad boys with will smith and martin lawrence
[3:10:45] 0oGooseo0: mustard bottle
[3:11:10] phatscout: actually was the song "bad boys" in any of the bad boys movies?
[3:11:30] demon_dandy: yeah but not the bob marley v i think
[3:11:31] phatscout: bad boys 2 had that song by p diddy that plays every like 15 mins or whatever
[3:12:10] demon_dandy: CaitlynS
[3:12:57] demon_dandy: this song has a vibe and i dont wanna say jsr again ashton51Tehe

[3:28:02] JulianoUchoa: Oh water levels are the worst
[3:28:03] AhRinge: this game became tempest for some reason
[3:28:03] walfas: I don't know if I've ever seen this game
[3:28:05] CINO_p: bam just like that, entirely new gameplay mechanic
[3:28:07] denchi__: god I played this game all the time as a kid
[3:28:08] phatscout: also the back of the vexx's box was something like "saving the princess is for pansies, try saving the world"
[3:28:13] PopatoGames: did you just eat that man
[3:28:18] denchi__: sorry, I lied
[3:28:20] denchi__: never saw it
[3:28:22] ArdenYves: edgier than thou geegaSmug
[3:28:23] denchi__: walfasLaugh
[3:28:40] AhRinge: tempest was an old old arcade game that has wireframe graphics where you move around a half pipe zapping things
[3:28:46] AhRinge: its really weird looking
[3:29:06] phatscout: ashton tempest 2000 stream
[3:29:08] phatscout: when
[3:29:20] demon_dandy: mrw the youth continue to suffer for the sins of the father ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[3:29:21] phatscout: you're in a pipe and you shoot things and there's 90s rave music
[3:29:28] phatscout: that's pretty much what tempest is
[3:29:51] phatscout: honestly this sounds like an off brand version of that one song from t2k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdjlSWipbWM
[3:30:08] hamflo: This doesn't even look like a real game
[3:30:20] denchi__: actually getting motion sick from this
[3:30:22] denchi__: LUL
[3:30:42] AhRinge: yea pipewerks I thought you made that joke cause you knew
[3:30:44] demon_dandy: rhe coggers level from early was pretty heinous
[3:30:47] AhRinge: hehe
[3:30:47] ArdenYves: ashton kraftwerk pilled? geegaGucci
[3:31:07] denchi__: denchi__ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:31:16] denchi__: kraftwerk are pog
[3:31:23] phatscout: tempest 2000 was part of that whole wave of 2000s "extreme arcade remakes" that was also host to like, pac man championship edition
[3:31:29] phatscout: and space invaders extreme
[3:31:50] phatscout: where it was "what if we took these old arcade games and added lots of particle effects and techno music"
[3:31:54] denchi__: gotta support fellow kraftwerkheads
[3:31:56] demon_dandy: pacman CE was pretty tight iirc
[3:32:06] ArdenYves: astrophysic's miku cover of The Model is so good tobsYAYSPEED
[3:32:08] phatscout: the og tempest was an arcade game but most people probably think of the jeff minter ones nowadays right?
[3:32:27] phatscout: it's a b game
[3:32:32] phatscout: i wouldn't call it bad
[3:32:39] phatscout: actually you want some shovelware kart racers
[3:32:40] hamflo: "Good shitty game" paperb26Patchy
[3:33:26] demon_dandy: kusoge that stinks good TehePelo
[3:33:47] phatscout: around the ps2 era there were a lot of mascot platfomers who were trying to go "hey you thought sonic was an animal with tude, well our dudes have even MORE TUDE"
[3:34:00] phatscout: and there were a bunch of not great games like whiplash, vexx, this, malice
[3:34:23] phatscout: shadow the hedgehog is arguably one of those tbh
[3:34:52] demon_dandy: oh i was just about to ask how many levels left
[3:35:27] AhRinge: snail bones...
[3:35:29] phatscout: this sounds like a level from the first ratchet and clank
[3:35:32] demon_dandy: damnnn sub 4 hour possible ashton51Pog
[3:35:46] phatscout: that bonus level music sounds like the song in.. whatever the city was right?
[3:36:18] phatscout: no I was referring to ratchet and clank
[3:36:33] phatscout: you ever play any of those?
[3:36:37] phatscout: oh wait no you didn't have a ps2
[3:36:58] denchi__: is this originally ps2?
[3:36:59] demon_dandy: the guitar riff specifically makes me think of no more heroes
[3:37:12] denchi__: syadouNaruhodo
[3:37:47] phatscout: infograms published this originally and they were going like super bankrupt at the time cuz of driver 3
[3:37:55] T33bags: This is teaching you how to be zapper
[3:38:07] phatscout: "cuz of driver 3 being expenseive and flopping" so I could see them licensing this out to scholastic
[3:38:23] phatscout: cuz they needed SOME games to sell on the flyers you get every month
[3:38:27] demon_dandy: i love nmh but its a game you can love from afar or youll love to play
[3:38:36] phatscout: does driver 3 count as shovelware?
[3:38:45] AhRinge: I would recommend no more heroes if you are ok with a game being cooler than it is good
[3:38:50] T33bags: By the end of this Ashton you‚Äôll be shooting lighting out of those chinchilla ears
[3:38:51] phatscout: like it's bad but also insanely ambitious
[3:40:01] demon_dandy: no more heroes has gameplay that youll either dig and able to tolerate the bs, or youll just not get into it
[3:40:20] phatscout: that's every suda51 game tbh
[3:40:30] AhRinge: I really really like nmh1 a lot its aesthetic and general vibe is cool
[3:40:35] demon_dandy: true true ashton51Tensai
[3:40:48] phatscout: i tried killer7 once and just counldn't get into it but I can see why some people fuck with it heavy

[3:41:26] 0oGooseo0: the brainworms are waking up lmao ashton51Tehe
[3:41:42] phatscout: this game was pretty much the end of the "edgy animal mascot" wave of games
[3:41:59] phatscout: right before everyone and their mother then tried to make "halo killers"
[3:41:59] AhRinge: travis is cannonically an anime fan who bought a laser sword on ebay and started assassinating people to get a girl to sleep with him
[3:42:04] phatscout: all of which pretty much flopped
[3:42:44] demon_dandy: lessgoooo ashton51Pog ashton51Pog

[3:45:29] demon_dandy: shes blastin ashton51Pog
