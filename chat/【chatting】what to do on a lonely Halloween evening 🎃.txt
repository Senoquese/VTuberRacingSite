[1:21:28] momoindahouse_: actually i read about it and it seems like it's basically laid out that it's connected to wake but people need to play it to figure out how so im good to just say it's connected

[1:22:14] demon_dandy: i remember the licensed music in this game went pretty hard
[1:22:36] Returner7: the shooting and movement is a bit slower, but the way the bodies rag doll definitely remind me of control lol
[1:22:44] KiranaRutoCh: Looking at the "Followed Channels" category, I noticed that my favorite rodent race queen is currently playing a horror game about a writer. "Alan Wake is getting really popular these days..." I wrote, unsure of what to say without getting to the territory of Spoilers.
[1:22:54] beat_shobon: from what im seeing today this game does have the vibes of a movie but not in a boring way, the way it looks also helps
[1:22:54] smoreeater: megumi31Wiggly2
[1:22:59] mczub: there's definitely bodies, you can chuck em around
[1:23:13] smoreeater: also Ashton you were right, megu is a bear megumi31Really

[1:24:53] momoindahouse_: i didnt know about American Nightmare being related
[1:24:58] vtuberacingcorp: Quantum Brake isn't really part of the thing. But it does reference Alan Wake.
[1:25:00] KiranaRutoCh: Alan Wake, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, Quantum Break, Control
[1:25:04] smoreeater: eat the lumber selkJammies
[1:25:07] Senoquese: the camera sometimes being on the left shoulder makes me so uncomfortable
[1:25:08] vtuberacingcorp: It's also a deeply weird game

[1:27:04] Playmer: So as long as it's not out, the flashlight will _always_ hurt them
[1:27:19] Playmer: Correct
[1:27:19] KiranaRutoCh: noticing the darkness, I had this instinct to remind Ashton. "No, they're not the Heartless. At least the Heartless can be cute. These are anything but." I wrote to the Stream's chat.
[1:27:31] Playmer: You can get away with not powering up the battery a ton
[1:27:55] KiranaRutoCh: Eh, just did it for fun.
[1:28:09] Playmer: I mean it takes practice, Feel free to drain those batteries. I just wanted you to know it's an option. I'll shut up now. please enjoy :)
