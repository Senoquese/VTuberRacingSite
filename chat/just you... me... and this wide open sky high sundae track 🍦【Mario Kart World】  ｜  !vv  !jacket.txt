[0:46:52] yojamjam: the exceedingly rare ashton existential crisis Clueless
[0:47:22] meechiigo: based

[0:47:28] AshtonMarten: bonavier has won 5 from the jump catch game!
[0:47:39] getterpilot: I mean, that's a you thing but it's not a failing at all to do things for profit
[0:47:52] CyclopsLeader: ashton51Smile
[0:47:57] Senoquese: as a long time viewer, i always felt like the things you focused on you looking professional at were the things that didnt *actually* contribute to your professional look and instead just stressed you out
[0:47:59] yojamjam: make that cashton girl
[0:48:01] CyclopsLeader: hi
[0:48:04] DatBoiVLC: Ashton ascending and realizing that us giving her our money is out dharma
[0:48:04] getterpilot: it's just kinda how our society works, you need money to live and all that
[0:48:04] PSYCOMMUnist: I don't think so. Wouldn't it be nice if you could quit being an office worker eventually? You need to support yourself silly.
[0:48:05] JTBun: yeah
[0:48:06] Kitkattack: I think it's fun that you have the freedom to bounce between chill low-key indie, then put on the keyfabe and look all professional
[0:48:09] PSYCOMMUnist: What'd suck if you quit being indie though.
[0:48:09] DatBoiVLC: our*
[0:48:13] meechiigo: as long as youre creating products you think are worth buying its ok
[0:48:15] JTBun: we want you to succeed
[0:48:17] demon_dandy: o7
[0:48:25] rikkaonline: accepting compensation for the value you create is still less than driving for a profit primarily, but both are fine
[0:48:26] DavidPortnov: Since we're here, I'm cool with the money pumping for merch. It's just on me to decide whether or not to buy.
[0:48:35] katsuragi_kakeruvt: !jacket
[0:48:35] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜 plus a cute bow to remind you of her idol-ness~!🎀🌈   Jacket: https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552 Bow: https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018553
[0:48:36] CyclopsLeader: you ok?
[0:48:44] dax812: I've heard a few big vtubers say monetizing/profits is always something they struggled to get behind, I think it was Limes
[0:48:49] Senoquese: i aint takin your damn happi discount i paid you back asap 😤
[0:49:15] JTBun: yeah you cut to price of the happi, which i dont think you didnt need to do
[0:49:16] Kitkattack: It is kind of invisible...
[0:49:29] Senoquese: yeah
[0:49:32] JTBun: yeah
[0:49:33] DatBoiVLC: there's also the factor that your community wants you to profit and benefit from your hard work
[0:49:39] KazooManEvan: Yeah j see where you're coming from
[0:49:44] DavidPortnov: My assumption is that all Vtuber merch is for profit.
[0:49:45] getterpilot: oh yeah I get that
[0:49:46] demon_dandy: i do always respect the real standards you take considering that sort of stuff ashton51Salute
[0:49:47] JTBun: yeah we want you to succeed
[0:49:53] DatBoiVLC: it's almost like hamstringing yourself for false humility, you're so deserving of your cut for your work
[0:49:58] InsaneLoke: ohhh horse
[0:50:09] DatBoiVLC: ohhh horse
[0:50:12] JTBun: @InsaneLoke 🐴
[0:50:14] Romblymo: There is the self destructive sense when you're making something where you don't want to benefit from it, you just want others to benefit. I get it
[0:50:14] rikkaonline: to avoid it, yeah thats a bit much, but not making it a priority isnt weird
[0:50:22] Kitkattack: Is it like a demand thing
[0:50:25] JTBun: girl

[2:47:04] demon_dandy: Go ashtonnnn ashton51Uwah
[2:47:06] TheAsterite: since you can aim shells where the camera is looking
[2:47:07] Burr11: you have to turn on the console first and then use it
