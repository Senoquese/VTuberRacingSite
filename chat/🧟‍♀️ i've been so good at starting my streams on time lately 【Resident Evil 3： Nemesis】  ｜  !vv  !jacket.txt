[1:07:27] bonavier: Rohan was in HS I thought
[1:07:33] superbeastie: SHES FUJOING OUT
[1:07:41] bonavier: Didn't Rohan transfer into josukes school
[1:07:45] Qrockpot: Rohan owned his own house didn't he? kinda old sus
[1:07:56] GigglePox: grown man beefing with kids
[1:07:57] Red__2: Rohan is employed, their can be no relationship
[1:07:57] spikebomb5: @Navy_Mongoose age gap matters a lot more when ur younger
[1:08:00] Navy_Mongoose: didn't read/watch jojos is showing
[1:08:08] niertlwal: fujowashing is strong
[1:08:10] demon_dandy: Its cause hes the araki stand in ICANT
[1:08:15] buruhas: Rohan should've been the cliche "prodigee high schooler that also does professional work on the side"
[1:08:18] bonavier: I was thinking of kakyoin cuz it's you
[1:08:31] Red__2: Rohan could get real problematic with his stand power
[1:08:31] rikkaonline: imo if a jp media has one sentence stating a character is underage, and removing that one sentence would make it otherwise seem ok, then its w/e to me
[1:08:33] Senoquese: i think it only matters if the age difference is an explicit dynamic. jojo never rly goes into detail about rohan being older
[1:08:45] Qrockpot: yeah would've made for a more compelling ship
[1:08:56] demon_dandy: tbh yeah ages in jojo gets pretty silly

[1:09:25] bvmmer: unless youre doing something actually illegal lol
[1:09:25] tub_of_bingus: it's because Koichi is just such a reliable guy that Rohan couldn't help but hang out with him and the Jojo crew by proxy
[1:09:34] Hasherin0: We all hung out at the weird 20-yo's place when we were teens... had to get the booze and lettuce somewhere lol
[1:09:41] Qrockpot: NOT ROHAN X KOICHI
