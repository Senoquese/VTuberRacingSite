[0:39:34] HashiriyaR32: no
[0:39:37] phatscout: unfortunately not
[0:39:39] Darkhollow360: So I‚Äôm guessing ur fav car is Furraridriver
[0:39:40] hajijo: Streamer Mode has royalty-free music which is nice
[0:39:44] Hyopsodus: its like sim/arcadey
[0:39:44] demon_dandy: zipper tech in forza yoooo
[0:39:44] DoctorDreads: Its about Family Ashton
[0:39:46] phatscout: you can drift, but there's no boost
[0:39:52] Sonicb00m111: No Zipper tech ashton51Heh
[0:40:03] MuttleyStrikeout: but banana peels would still work right?
[0:40:03] Darkhollow360: @hajijo last time I turned that on it just shuts off ur radio for stream
[0:40:07] spacechannel4: Music dmca at start?

[0:40:15] HashiriyaR32: CHeck settings
[0:40:43] HashiriyaR32: The 4 tracks used in the intro are DMCA safe I think.
[0:40:44] Darkhollow360: Only if it saves this video to ur clips

[0:40:51] Darkhollow360: They DMc me for that
[0:40:59] spacechannel4: SeemsGood SeemsGood big thanks chat
[0:41:06] phatscout: streamer mode locks you to the hospital station iirc
[0:41:08] demon_dandy: Monster sponsored Ashton
[0:41:12] KiranaRutoCh: Say, which Ken Block car do you prefer?
[0:41:15] hajijo: Oh, I think there's also a classical music station too lol
[0:41:26] HashiriyaR32: phat, this game's streamer mode also includes non-hospital records tracks
[0:41:28] Darkhollow360: @phatscout really?
[0:41:42] hajijo: Oh, when you jump like that, holding the brake will help you get a steady landing!
[0:41:43] KiranaRutoCh: Only 2 non-Hospital tracks, iirc
[0:41:53] ArdenYves: D:
[0:41:56] MuttleyStrikeout: KEKW
[0:41:58] Sonicb00m111: lmaooo
[0:42:00] HashiriyaR32: concussion is NOT fun
[0:42:00] phatscout: streamer mode locks you to the hospital records station (which tbh is the best station in the game) but if you don't

[0:42:01] phatscout: WHAT?
[0:42:02] CINO_p: l m a o

[0:42:34] phatscout: yeah you have to go between the flags
[0:42:41] phatscout: or "on" one of them
[0:43:05] hajijo: You can hit a flag and still be okay, but you can't go around them
[0:43:22] KiranaRutoCh: There's 1 Plague Vendor song and 1 LUXXURY song, but most of the songs are still Hospital songs
[0:43:23] Sonicb00m111: Car takes no damage kekw
[0:43:27] phatscout: no you're breaking
[0:43:34] Hyopsodus: you kinda cant in automatic but you can try with the handbreak. which is rb i think
[0:43:35] phatscout: on auto transmision when you break you reverse when stopped
[0:43:38] lovelaika: brake/reverse are the same button
[0:43:38] KiranaRutoCh: Hit the E-brake, left trigger for normal brake
[0:43:45] HashiriyaR32: brake  is LT, but it automatically reverses when you're stopped
[0:43:48] ArdenYves: we took the brakes off the car to reduce weight
[0:43:52] demon_dandy: normal brakes usually on reverse, e brake might be on x?
[0:44:00] phatscout: unless your on manual transmission
[0:44:00] lovelaika: A button is the emergency brake as well
[0:44:07] demon_dandy: oh A, my b
[0:44:10] phatscout: isn't X ebrake?
[0:44:15] HashiriyaR32: Nope, A
[0:44:20] Darkhollow360: I just always slow down at turns
[0:44:22] HashiriyaR32: On auto, X is "Open Map"
[0:44:37] phatscout: i'm on manual and I have A gear down, B gear up and X for ebrake
[0:44:37] mushi_buns: E break is slippery lol
[0:44:39] demon_dandy: you def just hit it
[0:44:47] HashiriyaR32: Emergency Brake.  Locks the rear wheels
[0:44:50] Sonicb00m111: Emergency
[0:44:50] phatscout: also I just realized that like you broke the scripted event
[0:44:54] demon_dandy: emergency, also called handbrake
[0:44:58] HashiriyaR32: key word "LOCKS"
[0:45:02] spacechannel4: E is the drift one SeemsGood

[0:55:59] KiranaRutoCh: use the Triggers
[0:56:07] phatscout: @VictorHandoyoCh depends on the car
[0:56:13] phatscout: liveries are vehicle dependent
[0:56:35] hajijo: Yeah, they're not really very helpful with the photo mode tutorial lol
[0:56:39] KiranaRutoCh: @Darkhollow360 The character Ashton mains in Diddy Kong Racing.
[0:56:42] demon_dandy: fantasticc
[0:56:44] Darkhollow360: Oh
[0:57:08] Darkhollow360: @phatscout I post mine as emblems. So anyone can use on any car
[0:57:14] Kitkattack: I'm glad your feeling better Ash, Hello ashton51Baby /
[0:57:28] KiranaRutoCh: And that's the one game I know Ashton plays because everytime I raid her it's ALWAYS in the middle of a Diddy Kong Racing stream XD
[0:57:52] Kitkattack: they said your name PogChamp
[0:57:58] Darkhollow360: Ash u love Ferrari?
[0:58:08] HashiriyaR32: Quick question, which edition of this did you get?

[0:59:09] demon_dandy: ghost car CaitlynS
[0:59:15] Darkhollow360: Wtf u phased
[0:59:20] KiranaRutoCh: Ashton the Ghost Rider?
[0:59:22] phatscout: yeah on non streamer that toggles your radio station
[0:59:28] allopettv: lmao i have to go so no more lurking, have fun and gnight all!
[0:59:39] phatscout: one you pull the ebrake you gotta peg the stick to the other direction
[0:59:52] phatscout: so turning left -> ebrake -> go right when you get some angle
[0:59:58] phatscout: and don't just floor the gass
[1:00:05] hajijo: Yep, all good tips!
[1:00:10] Darkhollow360: Ohhhh
[1:00:11] phatscout: just serach "how the dirft"
[1:00:14] hajijo: I'm not good with phrasing things like that lol
[1:00:15] lovelaika: just like lightning mcqueen...
[1:00:29] Hyopsodus: kinda gotta baby lots of controls in this game
[1:00:29] phatscout: yeah but this game doesn't model that
[1:00:37] HashiriyaR32: Line on the road gives you a guide as to when you can gas it and when to let off or brake
[1:00:41] HashiriyaR32: see red?  BRAKE
[1:01:12] erodozer: gotta love rear wheel drive ichimaiaAFK
[1:01:14] Hyopsodus: if its yellow, just let off the gas
[1:01:16] hajijo: Yeah, the racing line will help you know what to do and where! Blue is gas, white is lift, red is brake
[1:01:31] Hyopsodus: yeah
[1:01:35] HashiriyaR32: It's the "Suggested Line".  You have it on FULL right now
[1:01:38] hajijo: Yep!
[1:01:59] HashiriyaR32: Once you get used to the driving, consider setting it to "Braking Only"
[1:02:05] hajijo: That's what we're here for: fun!
[1:02:11] demon_dandy: its all good, as long as you enjoy da game
[1:02:11] HashiriyaR32: so you only get the line when you need to slow down.
[1:02:19] HashiriyaR32: k here we go
[1:02:22] hajijo: Oh hey, it's the Porsche we raced in the intro!
[1:02:47] hajijo: Three-car pass, E Z CLAP

[1:03:06] mczub: you gotta go in between the flags!

[1:03:58] mczub: yeah!! hitting the flags counts
[1:04:01] hajijo: That counts, go go go
[1:04:23] hajijo: Why use brakes when other cars slow you down just as quick, IMO
[1:04:27] ArdenYves: bumper karts ashton51Baby
[1:04:39] demon_dandy: @hajijo ashton51Tensai my fav strat
[1:05:03] erodozer: as someone who loves these games, watching your genuine enthusiasm as you play this for the first time has been refreshing and making me smile the whole stream
[1:05:14] Darkhollow360: @erodozer sameeeew
[1:05:15] demon_dandy: monka steer
[1:05:23] Hyopsodus: you dont need to be goodddd
[1:05:25] phatscout: so the secret to horizon is that you honestly don't really need to do that great
[1:05:30] ArdenYves: yo how she so good at this? ashton51Pog
[1:05:53] ffuwa_fuwa: this is so fun to watch ehehehe
[1:05:56] hajijo: There might be 12 drivers out here, but there's only ONE race queen!

[1:08:31] lovelaika: if youd like you CAN lower the difficulty
[1:08:40] hajijo: You probably don't need to ebrake here, honestly. Regular brake works just fine here!
[1:09:13] mczub: try to brake before you turn, if you brake and turn at the same time you run out of grip
[1:09:42] HarrisonFjord: bonk
[1:09:49] HashiriyaR32: Do we need to call in Trunk Monkey for the backseaters?
[1:09:56] YuzikoVT: I love that game yokoma1YuziDriving yokoma1YuziDriving yokoma1YuziDriving

[1:20:32] HashiriyaR32: phatscout, I have a playlist on my youtube channel and it deals with the sounds in this game.  Can't say more because off-topic.
[1:20:45] Hyopsodus: @erodozer I cruise around a LOT more than i race too lol
[1:21:07] demon_dandy: tbh it does seem like a fun game to wander and literally drift in
[1:21:10] erodozer: I just like driving around at the speed limit on roads and exploring, the world has so much depth
[1:21:20] DarkeonV: racing is for chumps I spent most of my time exploring and trying to get all the billboards

[1:23:28] DarkeonV: a lot of the billboards you just find them hidden or at the side of roads but some require you to like hit jumps exactly right and be creative with finding the right way to hit them
[1:24:10] demon_dandy: @hajijo i got a hatsune miku itasha on my need for speed heat supra ashton51Baby
