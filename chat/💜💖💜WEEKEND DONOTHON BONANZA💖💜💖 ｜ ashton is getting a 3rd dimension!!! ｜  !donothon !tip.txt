[1:08:05] InsaneLoke: That’s how it be
[1:08:14] hikaritaiyo_ch: eating sounds are cute
[1:08:42] american_cookie_1: I remember more of my nightmares than other dreams
[1:08:49] InsaneLoke: This chilla so maseyvRamen
[1:08:55] hikaritaiyo_ch: i had beef bowl!
[1:09:21] american_cookie_1: I’m eating cookies I made

[1:09:55] InsaneLoke: Really livin up to the name cookie
[1:10:22] Returner7: ashton51Steer
[1:10:29] american_cookie_1: I usually write down some of my dreams in a note file on my phone. I’ve been forgetting lately
[1:10:39] Rokros: I recently had a strange dream. My family and I were walking in the woods, and suddenly there was a crowd of laughing people. They started to prepare the place as if for some kind of ritual. Then my parents stole some shrine of theirs, and I was left to deal with them. After that, I woke up.
[1:10:44] InsaneLoke: I actually dreamt that too 😵‍💫
[1:11:20] InsaneLoke: twice, I dreamt you missed the stream and a different dream where I missed it
[1:11:29] hikaritaiyo_ch: yeah i dreamt that i was dancing with live sized shrimp
[1:11:42] InsaneLoke: 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
[1:11:52] american_cookie_1: I’ve got some weird dreams I could paste here.
[1:12:02] Senoquese: the last dream i rememeber was one where ashton streamed herself going to the beach and throwing random shit at people loool
[1:12:04] Returner7: 🦐🦐🦐
[1:12:39] hikaritaiyo_ch: oh, i lived in Japan and so many earthquakes in tall builds scared me
[1:12:59] Rokros: Yes. All my dreams like that are somehow connected. It's as if they all take place in some city and its surroundings, but it's not the city I live in.
[1:13:05] InsaneLoke: I think it’s cus ur streams are often right before zeep time
[1:13:06] hikaritaiyo_ch: yes, the buildings sway back and forth, its scary
[1:13:08] lightning_yinyang: Hello. Hope you are doing good
[1:13:14] Returner7: you have a general fear of heights Ashton?
[1:13:16] lightning_yinyang: You seem as happy as usual
[1:13:20] horribleham: One common thing in my dreams is giant waves.
[1:13:27] PastaThief911: just realized I'm pulling an ashton marten and washing my work truck like her intro while listening to the stream
[1:13:50] lightning_yinyang: It’s normal for that
[1:14:00] hikaritaiyo_ch: this is getting deep
[1:14:06] lightning_yinyang: Yeah. That is true
[1:14:53] nautacon: pretty sure most people only get to be in a plane crash ONCE
[1:14:59] keydget: What you're saying makes sense, then I gotta like ground myself by telling myself I get in a 4 wheeled death machine every day
[1:15:11] InsaneLoke: Not Joseph joestar
[1:15:36] keydget: Every time I get in an elevator I wonder if like the cables are gonna break the one time im in it
[1:15:42] horribleham: Every time I just think "Something terrible will happen" because what are the chances I have that thought and then something bad actually happens lol spamarBoss
[1:15:47] keydget: LET US HEAR keydgeLetsgo
[1:15:52] american_cookie_1: Wasn’t there an experiment on the survivability of a plane crash where they crashed a plane?
[1:15:58] InsaneLoke: I keep swallowing hair when I eat
[1:16:00] Returner7: hmm... a common thing in my vivid dreams is zero g/gravity having very little influence on me lol
[1:16:01] keydget: Then at least add reverb
[1:16:12] InsaneLoke: I’ve been in elevators when they broke a couples times, I’ve got weird luck
[1:16:13] american_cookie_1: Elevators are literally the safest form of transportation.
[1:16:22] Rokros: fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel fftChel
[1:16:27] horribleham: @keydget Good news! Elevators have mechanical breaks that kick in even in the event of electrical failure.
[1:16:44] Returner7: fail safe
[1:16:52] american_cookie_1: Each cable can hold the entire weight capacity.
[1:17:27] american_cookie_1: If all the cables snap, massive spikes stab into the building after falling only an inch.
[1:17:31] hikaritaiyo_ch: im so scared of drowing i havent been in a pool or the ocean in years.
[1:17:36] hikaritaiyo_ch: drowning*
[1:18:00] Rokros: I have one fear, but I won't write about it here, it's too relevant.
[1:18:34] american_cookie_1: This sounds like a dream
[1:19:10] ninoegyn: tentacles... ninoegFLURSHE
[1:19:21] JTBun: I rarely ever have dreams :(

[1:20:34] ninoegyn: omg have you ever woken up crying/laughing
[1:20:43] barfchan: i love oyster crackers
[1:20:53] ninoegyn: its so WEIRD i wake up laughing a lot tho
[1:21:09] Returner7: if anything I usually wake up sweating mom0kiSweats
[1:21:15] ubx64: I sometimes dream about being back in a high school and I'm in a panic because I can't remember what my next class is
[1:21:22] Senoquese: she dreams about smashing pit crew against the wall and wakes up laughing every single night
[1:21:29] JTBun: dude i hate how much i sweat at night
[1:21:31] ninoegyn: LMAO im da joker baby
[1:21:44] PastaThief911: I've had this dream about once every 4 months or so since I was in middle school where I'm tumbling down a an endless flight or stairs for a while then a brick wall pops up at the bottom and before i hit it I get jerked awake
[1:21:59] Returner7: @ubx64 oh god, my common nightmare is needing to poop in the middle of a timed college exam x_x
[1:22:05] horribleham: Lol! I have the same dream!!!
[1:22:15] horribleham: There is like one class I've completely forgotten about
[1:22:17] rikkaonline: thats a super common dream, i had it for years after school
[1:22:30] american_cookie_1: The scariest dream in recent memories wasn’t jump-scary per say, but more about loosing my friends. Loss of the people around me is my biggest fear. Loss meaning death or abandonment. A bit ironic, considering I did loose them at friends
[1:22:31] RobotFaker: I have the nightmare where I'm in the middle of college and find out I have to repeat all of high-school during the middle of it at the same time :sweat:
[1:22:45] Rokros: I once dreamed that I was a journalist, some military men caught me, tied me up, put a gun to the back of my head and shot me. That's my fear.
[1:23:05] hikaritaiyo_ch: i woke myself up yelling from a dream once it scared me so bad
[1:23:23] nautacon: ashton wakes up from nightmares in pvp mode
[1:23:27] horribleham: Everytime I die in a dream it wakes me up lol
[1:23:29] metaconstruct: bad things usually never happen in my dreams, they're only heavily implied
[1:23:37] ninoegyn: ITS THE WORST GETTING JUMPSCARED AWAKE
[1:23:54] PastaThief911: i had a lucid dream where I was a jedi with the force and a lightsaber and going around doing superhero stuff. it was cool as fuck
[1:24:10] JTBun: lmao
[1:24:22] Returner7: saw w/ anna kendrick?!
[1:24:28] metaconstruct: Lol
[1:24:30] american_cookie_1: I had that dream too when I was around 10. It’s scarier for me because of the drug abuse my mom has done
[1:24:44] hikaritaiyo_ch: scary!
[1:25:22] hikaritaiyo_ch: reminds me of the Saw movies for some reason
[1:25:34] horribleham: ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer

[1:27:58] Returner7: Rush Hour maybe lol
[1:27:59] JTBun: it's not a movie, but Community is now free on youtube
[1:27:59] Rokros: Start a remake. It extends the story well. If you go through the original first, the remake won't be as interesting.
[1:28:31] Returner7: idk you'll probably get audio muted for vod in either case
[1:28:49] JTBun: yes
[1:29:22] Returner7: hmm....

[29:52:44] JTBun: yeah Snipers can be a bit odd to play, mainly because you could have a longer range AR like a R301 instead and still use it in close up fights
[29:52:45] barfchan: yeah!
[29:52:50] demon_dandy: you do you do LMAO
[29:53:36] demon_dandy: kraber bretty rare
