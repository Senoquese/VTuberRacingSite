[4:30:25] demon_dandy: Its not lisp, you just fill in the blanks for what makes sense ashton51Tehe
[4:30:26] DatBoiVLC: it's literally the affectation, you pronounced it correctly but the way you sing it and the way it's produced make it indiscernible. misheard lyrics happen all the time with great music
[4:30:39] nagatsuka_masaaki97: i thought it was ‚Äúaround me‚Äù lmaoo
[4:31:07] Uzumaki_Beat: Yeah I could hear check it out still lol
[4:31:10] demon_dandy: You just fill in the blanks and check it out is a very common phrase
[4:31:19] DatBoiVLC: I made a lot of edits to the base one that we had but I think seno was working by themselves
[4:31:30] T33bags: genius short of these c;ips would go so hard

[4:31:34] T33bags: clips*
[4:31:36] DatBoiVLC: The lyrics make a lot more sense now ashton51Tehe
[4:31:46] Senoquese: i was editing the lyrics as i looped the song for hours editing the video LOL
[4:31:48] Uzumaki_Beat: But I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm used to songs having ‚Äúcheck it out‚Äù so my brain autofilled it in
[4:32:09] Senoquese: LOL
[4:32:10] demon_dandy: LOL
[4:32:13] Uzumaki_Beat: LOL

[4:33:10] Echo_81: yo echo81Yo

[4:35:03] Uzumaki_Beat: booogeyFire in the booth
[4:35:03] DatBoiVLC: I think something that is really subtle and hard to pull off is how well your character comes through in the song
[4:35:04] Senoquese: ooooo
[4:35:12] T33bags: @DatBoiVLC closet studio more likely (actually kinda effective)
