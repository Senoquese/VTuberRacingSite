[1:36:49] RycegoZ: I never learned how to read so I don't think I can read Dune
[1:36:58] Navy_Mongoose: It's really nerdy, if you like Anime then you'll be fine
[1:37:08] Burr11: you watched 1000 anime surely you picked up enough media literacy to read it
[1:37:13] Till_Ninkilim: they're not really that difficult a read from what I remember

[1:39:01] T33bags: but gay fanfiction has a considerably larger amount of butt stuff than dune
[1:39:05] Kitkattack: The whole second novel is like deconstructimg the hero
[1:39:23] Navy_Mongoose: Dune 1 and 2 movies cover the first book
[1:39:34] funnyplanet1: 2nd book is like a great comedown. its also quite boring
[1:39:35] Burr11: maybe start with Warcraft, those were easier
[1:39:35] InsaneLoke: we should watch the 1984 Dune movie as an introduction lol
[1:39:36] Kitkattack: Dune Messiah is the aftermath of galactic jihad

[1:43:23] Kitkattack: Hi hi baariez ashton51Cheer
[1:43:24] Burr11: well yeah.. but the gameplay is pretty different
[1:43:26] Navy_Mongoose: well even 2000s, Call of Duty was radically different from Halo

[1:43:50] T33bags: no not at all LOL
[1:43:53] demon_dandy: Dune??
[1:43:53] c_v_catullus16: No, Titanfall 2 has a much greater emphasis on platforming and parkour than on killing every enemy in an area.
[1:44:05] Kitkattack: The og doom games are vastly different shooters
[1:44:06] Navy_Mongoose: it's Goofy from Disney

[1:45:09] Burr11: RTSes mostly differ in how many factions there are and what the meta for each is
[1:45:11] Navy_Mongoose: idk if is a bear or a dog, but its neat
[1:45:18] Till_Ninkilim: yeah, FPS can vary a lot, between movement, how the guns feel, the general speed of combat, how squishy you and enemies are, etc There are a lot of elements to play with
[1:45:25] demon_dandy: Systems usually differ in like resource management and movement, some focus on town building etc
[1:45:30] Burr11: no it affects gameplay style too
[1:45:31] JTBun: gameplay can change
[1:45:43] Senoquese: YOU SAID IT
