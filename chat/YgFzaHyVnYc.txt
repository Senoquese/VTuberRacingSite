[1:51:32] ChessCatUWU: We can sacrifice tummy because it looks cute.
[1:51:44] InsaneLoke: Oh, I suggested to make it longer
[1:51:48] Senoquese: we can just stretch the belly button all the way up, no need for proper anatomy
[1:52:10] InsaneLoke: Yes
[1:52:12] Returner7: noooo!!!
[1:52:12] InsaneLoke: It will
[1:52:23] InsaneLoke: Belly buttons are a lot higher up on people than you think
[1:52:27] ChessCatUWU: PauseChamp
[1:52:28] horribleham: Make the bellybutton long. It should at least be 3 feet in length
[1:52:29] mushi_buns: thats way to high for belly button ashton51Steer
[1:52:38] InsaneLoke: It’s not at the bottom of the torso, and closer to the middle
[1:52:52] Senoquese: cant believe we're body shaming ashton for her incredibly high belly button ashton51Kneel
[1:52:58] ChessCatUWU: I guess it can just be lore that Ashton has a high belly button.
[1:53:00] InsaneLoke: Peak out of the shirts would be as accurate as you could to real anatomy
[1:53:01] mushi_buns: tommy line could be option
[1:53:07] InsaneLoke: Shorts*
[1:53:14] mushi_buns: tummy
[1:53:15] mushi_buns: skjfklsdjf
[1:53:20] Senoquese: tommy line ashton51Omega

[1:53:41] mushi_buns: some anime love to add a line that go's up the stomach
[1:53:41] demon_dandy: The tommy line, a legendary skate line by tommy wizard ashton51Tensai

[1:56:53] Senoquese: yeah pink
[1:57:03] demon_dandy: I guess color em so you can experiment
[1:57:12] InsaneLoke: I think white is the way to go, I’ve never seen any without the white line, it’s part of the visual identity
[1:57:33] demon_dandy: If it hard, it hard ashton51Baby
[1:57:42] Senoquese: real ashton51Kneel

[2:03:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They existed
[2:03:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they were called Drawstring bags
[2:03:16] Dreamdecipher: otherwise it would be a purse lol
[2:03:24] niertlwal: the mini rucksacks were p popular
[2:03:25] mrp0p1nfr3sh: My older sister had like 5

[2:03:48] CodeJason: Also sup ash
[2:03:51] mrp0p1nfr3sh: fanny pack would be hard to make chilla shaped
[2:03:55] JTBun: @CodeJason yeah like a corssbody
[2:03:58] InsaneLoke: Phanny pack around the shoulder diagonally
[2:04:02] JTBun: *cross
[2:04:09] sausagevt: Why did they have to give phanny packs such a dumb name 😭
[2:04:12] niertlwal: omfg loungefly just made jurrasic park bags???
[2:04:13] niertlwal: wtf
[2:04:31] CodeJason: Sling bag?
[2:04:32] InsaneLoke: What if they called phanny pack pussy pack instead, that’d be nuts no?
[2:04:35] niertlwal: and strawberry shortcake??
[2:04:40] niertlwal: @InsaneLoke foul
[2:04:41] demon_dandy: Fanny pack would be cute

[2:05:59] Returner7: hang on wouldn't your tail get in the way?
[2:06:01] JTBun: ^
[2:06:06] horribleham: That's where she keeps the lugnuts, memorize it pitcrew!
[2:06:06] mrp0p1nfr3sh: What if you had a chilla shaped Tapeplayer?
[2:06:22] niertlwal: man i wanna make a fanny pack now that looks like Jerry as a cheese triangle
[2:06:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I think the drawstring bag would be best for tail use
[2:06:22] Returner7: yeah probably wear in front or across your chest I think?
[2:06:27] InsaneLoke: Around the waist but pushed to the front side a bit!
[2:06:29] yukujimaari: the side of the bum
[2:06:31] mushi_buns: put it higher? and off to the side
[2:06:33] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @Returner7 Thats too modern
[2:06:34] demon_dandy: I think its more stylish in thhe front
[2:06:37] Returner7: or maybe a cute little chilla backpack???
[2:06:52] InsaneLoke: In the front but asymmetrical
[2:06:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Id go with a tape player instead
[2:06:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: since you have a bag already
[2:07:05] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah like front right thigh
[2:07:08] digi_shell: ashton: how about a cute knapsack on the back?
[2:07:10] allopettv: the drawstring bag was a good idea imo
[2:07:16] digi_shell: its a 3D model after all :3
[2:07:22] InsaneLoke: Like on the left side (from us looking at the canvas)
[2:07:27] JTBun: yeah I think drawstring bad would be the way to go
[2:07:34] JTBun: *bag
[2:07:45] mrp0p1nfr3sh: I think the bag is cuter
[2:07:46] demon_dandy: Who said that??
[2:07:47] Returner7: asymmetric on your side is probably goo too if you really want!
[2:07:47] JTBun: we can try
[2:07:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Because its like the pitcrew always has your back
[2:08:01] Senoquese: its over fannystans ashton51Kneel
[2:08:01] Returner7: sadly incompatible with your tail LOL!
[2:08:14] yukujimaari: fanny pack my beloved

[2:08:26] american_cookie_1: Tail hole
[2:08:46] demon_dandy: Yeah on the hip is fine as well
[2:08:53] HarrisonFjord: what kind of material for the fanny pack? what if it was that glossy mirrored material
[2:08:54] JTBun: or you could the walkman on the fanny pack belt and put the fanny pack in the front
[2:08:57] sausagevt: I think you should ultimately do whatever makes you the happiest sausag24Sosig
[2:09:02] demon_dandy: erm technically thats your left hip ninoegNERDGE
[2:09:05] HarrisonFjord: oooh a  walkman would be sick
[2:09:27] Senoquese: i was thinkin the right leg so it would contrast with the pocket
[2:09:39] InsaneLoke: Left side because it puts balance to the design, you’ve already got that white pocket? And the logo. Having 3 things on the right creates an imbalance with the left side
[2:09:44] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah
[2:10:01] HarrisonFjord: fanny pack instead of the pocket imo
[2:10:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Fair
[2:10:21] Rhou_0: Pocket in shorts for women? That's too modern LUL
[2:10:25] sausagevt: What color do you want the Walkman yo be sausag24Sosig
[2:10:32] mrp0p1nfr3sh: What if you go with an ipod mini???

[2:11:13] mrp0p1nfr3sh: she can hold one lugnut
[2:11:16] demon_dandy: Not a peanut m&m either
[2:11:21] T33bags: No top only shorts my nose bleeding
