[0:46:04] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[0:46:06] Burr11: lmao what
[0:46:16] rikkaonline: i think youd be totally justified in raising complete hell with them over this. youre a partner and that has resulted in your streams getting worse because of their poor hardware with publicly known issues
[0:46:24] ArthurAbbott: OH yah that should capture HDMI 2.1, I have the prior variant of the internal capture card and it has these same issues, had to keep my external HD60 X around to capture my PS5
[0:46:35] lukmapache: it was a good effort
[0:46:36] rikkaonline: like privately
[0:46:39] Burr11: this is pretty embarrassing for them..
[0:46:43] Aeckbot: you should threaten them physically
[0:46:55] Jioriku: It’s so joever chat. I’ll poke out docs and see what we have going on. Shoutout Elgato for the PCI-E card only issues lol.
[0:46:55] REBEL_Mightgold12: BibleThump
[0:47:02] JTBun: yeah it seems like the older models are the more reliable ones sjgkjdfhg
[0:47:14] Based_Hopper: I guess you should have more than 1 capture card just in case of stuff like these?
[0:47:19] lukmapache: you should do the god ol direct aproach  and throw a brick at them
[0:47:22] mushi_buns: ty for the help!! ashton51Love
[0:47:39] Burr11: thanks for trying ashton51Wibble
[0:47:40] demon_dandy: If you get a direct line, maybe you should troubleshoot with stream off ashton51Tehe
[0:47:43] JTBun: well cutting edge should mean you cant also have so many issues with it
[0:48:05] demon_dandy: Yeye if you get to that point i mean
[0:48:10] rikkaonline: yeah thats the sort of path i mean

[0:48:33] demon_dandy: It aint your fault ashton ashton51Baby
[0:48:33] Based_Hopper: Tbf cutting edge could also mean experimental and that can bring risks
[0:48:35] ApocalypseSC: ashton51Love sorry it's been so much trouble

[0:49:12] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They make those little HDCP stripping boxes to get consoles working.
[0:49:30] Navy_Mongoose: have you tried blowing into it?
[0:49:32] ArthurAbbott: The most obnoxious part of this is that the 4K Pro literally advertises in bug ass letters on the amazon page "PS5 AND XBOX SERIES X CAPTURE"
[0:49:44] ArthurAbbott: Like thats a selling point
[0:49:45] Based_Hopper: Can't wait for truth of...doodoo

[0:51:10] Senoquese: ask them for a thousand dollars of missed revenue from this stream ashton51Wibble
[0:51:10] ArthurAbbott: You wanna know something even worse? I once somehow got the PS5 to work with my 4K60 Pro, one time, but it stopped working after the one time
[0:51:14] Navy_Mongoose: external as a backup?
[0:51:21] ArthurAbbott: External, I can confirm the HD60X works with it

[1:39:45] ApocalypseSC: same when he's staggered
[1:39:49] ApocalypseSC: hope that's not too backseaty
[1:40:12] ApocalypseSC: yeah you just need to do a light attack when he's staggered
[1:40:27] lukmapache: when you stagger him, get behind him and light attack
[1:40:32] lukmapache: from behind
[1:40:36] demon_dandy: Oh its really like the visceral attack in bb
[1:41:06] ApocalypseSC: it puts a red marker down you stand in to light attack and trigger the visceral
[1:42:23] orminthebox: I think so
[1:42:36] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:42:37] lukmapache: when he reaches half his health it will get white

[1:57:14] Tazzle_Ch: like it feels lifeless
[1:57:41] ArthurAbbott: I think honestly the Pinocchio elements almost detract from it? Like it really doesnt do too much interesting and goes with the most generic "oh yah animatronics go evil haha" concept
