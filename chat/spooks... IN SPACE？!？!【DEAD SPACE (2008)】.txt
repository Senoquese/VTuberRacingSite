[0:14:57] vtuberacingcorp: I swear to god developers just never want to respect how games _should_ start up.
[0:14:57] 0oGooseo0: the remake is gonna have a different atmosphere i think since they're gonna have voice acting for Issac unlike the original.
[0:15:28] 0oGooseo0: not for the character you play as, no

[0:29:22] Zopriar: This game is truly a one of a kind, even if it's heavily based off of RE4.
[0:29:40] ryanstromkai: yeah its got some wacky camera positions
[0:29:41] edulcorante_: this game's interface is amazing even to this day
[0:30:03] Zerorush: You also have a stomp button. Stomp any dead body into pieces. The aliens can bring dead corpses back to life it‚Äôs still intact
[0:30:07] Returner7: yeah you're supposed to be a bit slow and zoomed in

[0:32:15] the_monster_mike: chapter 1
[0:32:44] 0oGooseo0: the first chapter is called new arrivals

[0:36:52] demon_dandy: he was still alive NotLikeThis
[0:37:01] Zerorush: I think it‚Äôs one of the shoulder buttons while you‚Äôre aiming to rotate it?
[0:37:05] Returner7: be careful, only use items and ammo when you really need to!!!
[0:37:27] demon_dandy: STOMP THEY ASS

[0:38:04] Zopriar: you missed some boxes
[0:38:05] Returner7: lol funnily enough, IIRC he curses as you stomp and punch in Dead Space 2!!!
[0:38:17] Zerorush: Yeah like legit Isaac can just stomp limbs off. He doesn‚Äôt skip leg day
[0:38:18] 0oGooseo0: heavy space suits help for curb stomps
[0:38:44] ueko: HUGE agree
[0:38:48] 0oGooseo0: tbf he had a voice in the second game
[0:38:49] demon_dandy: i personally prefer silent protag isaac too ashton51Baby
[0:39:02] 0oGooseo0: but the voice actors were do good
[0:39:03] Zerorush: You can open that
[0:39:14] Zerorush: Press A I think?

[0:42:50] Returner7: there is limited inventory space, you'll run into eventually you can worry about it then
[0:42:58] Zerorush: Always aim for limbs. Shooting them dead center barely does any damage. They all dead fleshy monsters haha
[0:43:12] demon_dandy: yeah technically the cutter you have is a mechanic tool iirc
[0:43:14] Returner7: stomp to make sure!
[0:43:20] Zopriar: yeah it's dead
[0:43:29] Zerorush: Human limbs to. They‚Äôll infect desd human bodies or reinfect dead alien ones

[0:43:36] demon_dandy: ashton51Wiggly
[0:43:38] Zerorush: Gotta reduce all the corpses to pieces haha
[0:44:38] demon_dandy: the melee is mostly to push em off you i think
[0:44:39] Returner7: your gun is a plasma cutter, see the three dots? it's the line it cuts in!
[0:44:40] Zerorush: iirc if the body is missing both legs or both arms it won‚Äôt come back
[0:44:48] Zopriar: no swinging your weapon doesn't really hurt them
[0:44:54] demon_dandy: ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[0:45:35] 0oGooseo0: you have a full bar of it
[0:45:42] Returner7: reload w/ b? for your gun, but i forget the controls to use stasis

[0:47:56] T33bags: Ashton you gotta kill all of the aliens
[0:48:02] Zopriar: You don't need to do it for the first chapter. near the end of the second chapter is when you'll need to start breaking corpses nearly everytime you see them
[0:48:22] edulcorante_: get all the power nodes you can, they're important

[0:49:37] demon_dandy: have a good one buns ashton51Baby
[0:49:41] 0oGooseo0: you can take one arm and one leg for easy kills
[0:50:01] Zerorush: You‚Äôll get plenty of ammo assuming you aren‚Äôt missing tons of shots
[0:50:04] Returner7: yeah conserve, but melee doesn't do much damage in this game
[0:50:13] demon_dandy: melee is for pushin em off ya i think ashton51Tensai youll get the hang of it
[0:50:19] MeadowAtLast: lol
[0:50:37] 0oGooseo0: aim then right trigger to shoot
[0:50:39] Zopriar: yes
[0:50:45] shindigs: is this game on steam now
[0:50:53] Zerorush: Imo it pays off once they‚Äôre on the ground to just double tap and also blast off an arm or something. I always had plenty of ammo, you‚Äôre gonna get other weapons
[0:50:58] Zopriar: aim then you can use stasis or reload
[0:50:59] shindigs: there's a part of this game where they recorded a horrific screech from a san francisco subway
[0:51:04] 0oGooseo0: you have to hold aim to shoot though
[0:51:06] Kitkattack: harness the power of the medula
[0:51:08] edulcorante_: it always was i think
[0:51:52] Zerorush: Just shoot an arm off to finish them. Health packs are more valuable than ammo
[0:51:57] Zopriar: Use Stasis on them and then stomp them so you won't get attacked
[0:52:00] Returner7: keep exploring you'll find  hints I think
[0:52:20] edulcorante_: wait, what determines the drop is what limb you cut last?
[0:52:52] Zerorush: I mean like, instead of trying to melee them. Ammo isn‚Äôt THAT scarce
[0:53:03] Zopriar: Aim and the press X
[0:53:05] edulcorante_: oh ok lmao
[0:53:05] 0oGooseo0: you have to hold aim to do it
[0:53:08] Zerorush: Just finish them by shooting another limb off
[0:53:23] kitsu_vikra: We dyin in Space?
[0:53:25] Returner7: wait are you using an xbox controller or ps4?
[0:53:25] demon_dandy: xbox X button?
[0:53:35] Kitkattack: is it square
[0:53:40] Kitkattack: lololol
[0:53:44] 0oGooseo0: chinch16Monky
[0:53:45] edulcorante_: lmao
[0:53:50] demon_dandy: unfortunate ashton51Tensai
[0:53:53] Zopriar: OH!
[0:53:53] 0oGooseo0: lmao
[0:53:54] Teza_Kinoku: Teza_Kinoku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:54:03] Zopriar: I play Xbox sorry
[0:54:11] Kitkattack: ashton51Tensai
[0:54:30] Kitkattack: smartee pants
[0:54:39] demon_dandy: NOW they gotta watch out ashton51Tensai
[0:54:40] 0oGooseo0: you can just remap all your stuff tbh it'll make it easier for sure
[0:55:17] Zerorush: Ye he dead dead
[0:55:34] Returner7: probably collision glitch lol
[0:55:41] Zerorush: Sometimes body parts clip through stuff and freak out haha
[0:55:45] Based_Bug: oh he creepin
[0:55:56] Zopriar: New enemy
[0:56:02] demon_dandy: CaitlynS w was that an alien
[0:56:04] 0oGooseo0: oh God the leapers
[0:56:05] Kitkattack: he's comin for you giblets
[0:56:08] Zerorush: Those guys can be tricky
[0:56:08] edulcorante_: have you ever heard of the hit game among us, isaac
[0:56:19] 0oGooseo0: they do be venting
[0:56:21] Zerorush: They‚Äôre low to the ground so it can be hard to get their limbs
[0:56:22] Returner7: don't forget to reload! you typically want to be topped off at all times
[0:56:24] 0oGooseo0: pretty sus
[0:57:15] Zerorush: You‚Äôll get a kickass weapon fairly early called the ripper. It‚Äôs the best weapon in the game ashton51Tensai
[0:57:20] kona_kei: Hi Ashton!!!!! Omg is this a scary game?
[0:57:20] Senoquese: chat is so focused on the game nobody freaked out over the bdsm joke
[0:57:26] Zerorush: Makes slicing them up easy af
[0:57:26] 0oGooseo0: they'll explain later on
[0:57:51] Returner7: hang on you have an xbox controller don't you? might be less confusing if you use that?
[0:58:03] 0oGooseo0: you can check your path with the right stick button
[0:58:10] kona_kei: I hope the dumpy will be removed from twitch prison  twitchson
[0:58:26] Zerorush: You can use your waymark thingy. It‚Äôll show you where to go for the main objective ashton51Baby
[0:58:33] demon_dandy: just a note, you can walk into those slamming doors and get grinded ashton51Baby
[0:58:49] Returner7: yeah it's a unique death!
[0:58:57] demon_dandy: the urge beckons ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[0:59:00] 0oGooseo0: there's so many unique death animations in this game i love it
[0:59:11] Zerorush: Isaac has a lot of brutal deaths in this lol
[0:59:24] 0oGooseo0: they're so brutal lmao
[0:59:42] vtuberacingcorp: Reminds me of the first few minutes of the Tomb Raider reboot I played...just awful
[0:59:45] Zerorush: Like they saw the chainsaw kill in RE4 and were like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do that but like dozens of times over‚Äù
[0:59:47] demon_dandy: tbh my spine could get grinded by that door and probably come out better orz
[1:00:00] edulcorante_: lmao
[1:00:07] Returner7: back in old school Resident Evil, you had a limited number of saves mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats mom0kiSweats
[1:00:21] Zopriar: I usually do two save slots. just in case one save is in a really bad spot
[1:00:42] DoctorDreads: Hi Ashton
[1:00:48] kona_kei: they remind me of uncooked chicken monsters
[1:00:51] DoctorDreads: How's spoopy game?
[1:00:51] demon_dandy: close call ashton51Tensai
[1:01:31] edulcorante_: nah i feel you, it's kinda hard to aim
[1:01:32] vtuberacingcorp: maybe a mouse would be easier for you
[1:01:36] 0oGooseo0: lmao you can always leave the room if you need a second to breathe
[1:01:49] edulcorante_: remember having a tough time playing on x360
[1:01:59] demon_dandy: if you feel better on mk you can, its not essential to controller it pickychMOUIKKAI
[1:02:01] 0oGooseo0: though I think they can follow you through the vents
[1:02:01] Returner7: what?! then you should probably use mouse?
[1:02:15] Returner7: LMAO!
[1:02:18] Zerorush: You‚Äôre not doing too bad so far ashton51Baby
[1:02:26] 0oGooseo0: you stomped an explosive canister lmao
[1:02:31] demon_dandy: pranked ya ashton51Baby
[1:02:48] edulcorante_: now you know what the shining red thingys are
[1:02:52] Zerorush: Oh you‚Äôll get a nifty thing that will let you grab and throw things like those canisters
[1:03:01] Kitkattack: yeah that's kind of the gimmick for these guys
[1:03:03] Zerorush: Basically
[1:03:17] vtuberacingcorp: But yeah you should probably consider switching, I didn't realize you were uncomfortable with controllers. You'll probably kill this considering your Apex experience.
[1:03:20] demon_dandy: maybe that red is a health cannister this time ashton51Tensai
[1:03:31] edulcorante_: i wanna replay this game now
[1:03:37] vtuberacingcorp: (In this type of game I mean regarding comfortableness with controllers)
[1:03:42] Zerorush: You‚Äôre counter some of them that are wearing armor that protects their legs . You‚Äôll have to look out for those ones
[1:03:46] Zopriar: On the harder difficulties you need to cut off 3 or sometimes even all four limbs for them to die
[1:03:50] Returner7: yeah totally use keyboard and mouse if you're familiar with other PC FPS!
[1:04:05] demon_dandy: megumi31Dance
[1:04:07] Zerorush: Shoot him
[1:04:17] Zerorush: Haha
[1:04:31] demon_dandy: no more pranks ashton51Tensai
[1:04:50] Zerorush: That dude straight up like ‚ÄúHOW DID SHE KNOW‚Äù
[1:05:12] 0oGooseo0: I think you can reload without aiming if you press x
[1:05:26] 0oGooseo0: or y maybe
[1:05:33] 0oGooseo0: one of them let's you
[1:05:36] Zopriar: No that's healing
[1:05:55] Zopriar: Y is exclusive to DS 2 I think
[1:06:07] Zopriar: You're out of Stasis
[1:06:16] edulcorante_: it do be fucked up
[1:06:18] demon_dandy: im sure some pitcrew are getting jealous of the aliens under your boot ashton51Tensai
[1:06:19] Zerorush: You can keep your gun locked on the horizontal position. Might make aiming easier
[1:06:19] Kitkattack: body is only good to push them back a little
[1:06:43] Returner7: it looked like you missed maybe?
[1:06:46] Zopriar: Shoot the legs. much easier to hit since their bigger
[1:06:59] edulcorante_: you came where you got for
[1:07:05] Returner7: nice shot!
[1:07:07] demon_dandy: ashton51Bork
[1:07:23] kevx59: nekoel4Rave
[1:07:25] 0oGooseo0: this game likes to let you think you're safe and then it gets you lmao
[1:07:34] Returner7: don't forget to top off your mag outside of combat!
[1:07:36] vtuberacingcorp: Yeah seems like you hit the crotch quite often, which like, respect, but alas.
[1:08:18] kevx59: playing this game gives me so much anxiety. Those jump scares
[1:08:49] demon_dandy: shes just too strong ashton51Tensai ashton51Tensai
[1:08:52] Returner7: you're playing with your audience that's why!! ashton51Love ashton51Love ashton51Love
[1:08:57] edulcorante_: the first game got me by surprise like one time bc i was distracted
[1:09:12] edulcorante_: the second one tho i literally screamed once lol
[1:09:30] Zerorush: Damage on the plasma cutter and health is probably most important right now
[1:09:32] Returner7: oh then hydrate too!
[1:09:38] Kitkattack: woah ur heart rate is fast ashton51Love
[1:09:44] demon_dandy: if you cant go on, dont force it amigo ashton51Steer
[1:09:53] Zopriar: you get used to killing them. the jumpscares are the real scary parts
[1:09:56] Zerorush: Take it easy if you gotta ashton51Love
[1:09:57] Kitkattack: I can't handle the doki doki ashton51Steer
[1:10:11] Returner7: booster #4 knocked out for a day ashton51Steer
[1:10:41] Zopriar: Go for Cap
[1:10:41] demon_dandy: LMAO alright but comfy yo megumi31Wiggly2
[1:10:42] edulcorante_: that noise tho
[1:10:47] 0oGooseo0: lmao rip
[1:10:53] Zopriar: oodlf
[1:11:10] Zerorush: You‚Äôll want to pay attention to where you put nodes, so you don‚Äôt put them in spaces you don‚Äôt have to
[1:11:11] Returner7: you'll get more no worries, but prioritize what you want
[1:11:17] Returner7: your neck?!
[1:11:24] demon_dandy: ashton51Tehe
[1:11:31] Zerorush: You can waste more than you realize going down blank areas lol
[1:11:34] Kitkattack: poor Ashi ashton51Baby
[1:11:42] 0oGooseo0: you should get some icy hot for muscle pain
[1:11:45] Zopriar: nodes are limited and buying them cost 10k credits. use them very wisely
[1:12:14] edulcorante_: skill tree?
[1:12:20] demon_dandy: the dreaded skill tree NotLikeThis
[1:12:22] Kitkattack: this navigation map is pretty unique
[1:12:31] Returner7: lol it was my entire body that was in pain after booster #4
[1:12:32] edulcorante_: i do like skill trees a lot ngl
[1:12:34] 0oGooseo0: lmao I like how he bolted into a full sprint as you said he was slow
[1:12:43] Based_Bug: skill trees in a horror game sound extremely stressful
[1:12:52] vtuberacingcorp: I want cheats back, gimme all the skills at the beginning
[1:12:54] Zerorush: Honestly the most important guns in the game imo are the plasma cutter and the ripper. I always upgrade those and my suit first. Other weapons can wait
[1:13:09] Zerorush: A lot of people like the line gun tho
[1:13:15] Zopriar: It's why I only use the plasma cutter because you'll have just enough nodes to max out everything
[1:13:19] 0oGooseo0: I like how in the second game if you beat it zealot difficulty you got the foam finger gun
[1:13:39] Senoquese: i hate it when games have so many skills that you cant even unlock half of em by the end
[1:13:51] Zerorush: The foam finger gun is so funny lmao
[1:13:58] Returner7: some limbs may have more hp than others
[1:14:04] demon_dandy: plasma cutrer is the ol reliable, i dont blame ya
[1:14:07] 0oGooseo0: I like how he says bang when he shoots it
[1:14:31] vtuberacingcorp: I mean you can use the dart gun to shoot buttons in places you can't get to.
[1:14:33] 0oGooseo0: the foam finger is a one shot kill since its a secret
[1:14:47] Zerorush: The ripper let‚Äôs you levitate a serrated blade in front of you. The necros will literally just run into it and cut their own limbs off it‚Äôs amazing lol
[1:15:08] Zerorush: You can also shoot the blades like normal
[1:15:10] vtuberacingcorp: Well not everyone uses the prey skills, the turrets will shoot you if you go too alien
[1:15:12] 0oGooseo0: its mostly for people who wanted to do a human only playthrough
[1:15:32] vtuberacingcorp: yeah I did human only when I played
[1:15:56] 0oGooseo0: I found the human abilities to be pretty overpowered tbh
[1:15:59] demon_dandy: lmao
[1:16:00] Returner7: yeah weapons in this game are very creative!!! most are actually like construction tools based on in game lore
[1:16:39] edulcorante_: killer7 be like
[1:16:48] Returner7: you mean stream delay or just sensitivity?
[1:16:48] edulcorante_: never play that game with mk
[1:17:07] Returner7: yeah I do recall that being a problem w/ the port
[1:17:17] 0oGooseo0: the guy who got attacked is gone...
[1:17:27] Zerorush: They stick with that construction tool theme throughout the game to. Like you get an actual proper machine gun like weapon and it suuuucks haha
[1:17:49] Zerorush: The military rifle I think it‚Äôs called
[1:17:50] Returner7: yes \
[1:17:50] 0oGooseo0: there's a few yeah
[1:17:55] Zopriar: yeah a couple
[1:18:10] 0oGooseo0: the pulse rifle is the only actual gun in this game
[1:18:31] Zopriar: there's three main bosses and four mini bosses
[1:18:40] Kitkattack: we're in your walls Ash
[1:18:41] Zerorush: Pulse rifle blows lol

[1:25:05] vtuberacingcorp: I just like to upgrade stuff
[1:25:05] Zopriar: If you can always upgrade the suit
[1:25:08] 0oGooseo0: the suit gives you more inventory space
[1:25:11] demon_dandy: fitting its the game famous for stomping huh ashton51Tensai
[1:25:21] Zerorush: The line gun is kind of like the shotgun of the game. It makes aiming easier but it‚Äôs not necessary and imo
[1:25:36] Zopriar: It also gives you armor so you take less damage
[1:25:59] Returner7: this is pretty cool!
[1:26:13] demon_dandy: gamestop booty ashton51Tensai

[2:21:50] Zerorush: There was also one about traditional dancing, isakoi I think it‚Äôs called??
[2:21:50] 0oGooseo0: they shoot like boney spines
[2:21:52] kevx59: For a show about motorcycles Bakuon roasted the shit out of the experience of owning and riding one
[2:21:58] Zerorush: The characters were cute
[2:22:02] Zerorush: They do
[2:22:10] Zerorush: Meat missles

[2:23:20] 0oGooseo0: its so grotesque
[2:23:27] cakeswindle: @zerorush nah I remember when it came out, just haven't thought about it for a while
[2:23:31] demon_dandy: i liked super cub for bein like less glamorous in ways
[2:23:39] Zerorush: It‚Äôs worth playing for sure if you‚Äôre interested in the remake coming out at all
[2:23:43] cakeswindle: remake soon right??
[2:23:47] kevx59: Is this the og or a remaster? It still looks really good.

[2:25:01] Zerorush: I love this game
[2:25:09] demon_dandy: they similar but different vibes i think
[2:25:24] Zerorush: And the sequel. Three is a fun co-op game but it‚Äôs not as good as the first two

[2:26:06] cakeswindle: I love the way the enemies are like "observe my long thing extremities, perfects for slicing"
[2:26:10] Returner7: 3 wasn't super well liked
[2:26:14] Zerorush: Yeah it‚Äôs a trilogy
[2:26:40] 0oGooseo0: we'll see. I think the remake is intended to be a soft reboot as well
[2:26:45] Zerorush: 3 was buried under things EA demanded the studio do, like micro transactions and more of a focus on action
