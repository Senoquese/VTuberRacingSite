[0:23:55] NyariHelalixir: the music is in this game kicks SO much ass btw
[0:23:55] RycegoZ: Going fast on mountain roads is dangerous enough, plus they watched out for cops
[0:23:56] HashiriyaR32: Mid Night Club pretty much ruled the expressways.
[0:24:02] ReyJaggy: high schoolers had cool cars
[0:24:14] HashiriyaR32: specifically Tokyo's bayshore route
[0:24:17] c_v_catullus16: Is THAT bubble when Japanese stopped having children?

[0:24:23] RobotFaker: wait midnight club was a real term

[0:24:28] RobotFaker: i thought it was just that game lol
[0:24:29] erodozer: There were also the Tokyo Xtreme racer games around this time too
[0:24:46] rikkaonline: no the bubble is economic, not population
[0:25:07] MikeFiro: Plus the boom in Automotive Tech and a bunch of Tuners testing there Metal was probably what made cars what they were today plus US was recovering from the 80s Oil Crisis so a lot of factors :0
[0:25:16] metaconstruct: bubble economy \o/

[0:29:01] NyariHelalixir: ashton rents a sports car in yokohama (GONE CRAZY)
[0:29:25] c_v_catullus16: At the very end of the Zhou dynasty in Chinese history, the emperor's power weakened so much that he was no more than a figurehead. This led vassal states to begin fighting for supremacy without the authority of the emperor.
[0:29:27] demon_dandy: the racing lagoon pilgrimage ohhhh yeaaaah surelyyy ashton51Stare
