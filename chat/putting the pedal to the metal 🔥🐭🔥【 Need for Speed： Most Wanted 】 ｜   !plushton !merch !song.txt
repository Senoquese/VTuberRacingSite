[0:51:48] sirmars1: What? Topic chaning in a Miss Ashton stream. That Never happens.
[0:51:56] JonasPolsky: kirsMoney kirsMoney kirsMoney kirsMoney kirsMoney
[0:52:02] virtualoop: is that a hot take?
[0:52:07] GManx0: She wants FREE ART from Fans
[0:52:09] chinwillach: ashton51Squish
[0:52:18] Spike_AD: lmao
[0:52:24] JonasPolsky: wait until you hear about screenwriting competitions staryuukiSaiyajin
[0:52:32] ChewyChio: ohh, because people say "its taking advantage of artists" otherwise
[0:52:33] GManx0: Nah
[0:52:40] Burr11: like outfit designs?
[0:53:00] virtualoop: oh like that
[0:53:01] ChewyChio: yeah as an artist I dont mind, like I wouldnt join if I wasnt okay with the terms
[0:53:06] Burr11: i agree with you on that
[0:53:11] TheRATifier1: What up ash been a bit
[0:53:14] Kitkattack: hmmm, yeah it can go both ways...
[0:53:15] ReyJaggy: I agree even some artists agree
[0:53:22] Spike_AD: Yeah I guess it depends on how you phrase it, should be nothing wrong with just doing it for fun
[0:53:23] Burr11: like that is about the fans and it would be so cool to see it
[0:53:27] sirmars1: Poor Wall. Always getting into arguements.
[0:53:27] GManx0: The feeeling of Present Enough is a bit more questionable
[0:53:38] FranzNF: for exposure work letsgooooo
[0:53:40] InsaneLoke: i think its different when its an individual doing the comp compared to a business doing the comp
[0:53:43] JonasPolsky: new vtuber contest being developed as we speak asleepyZOOM
[0:53:43] Kitkattack: artists need to value their own time but I agree ashton51Stare
[0:53:44] rikkaonline: idk i think design is more than just art, but like if you want to compete for a prize then dont enter
[0:53:46] virtualoop: if theyre not doing a monetary thing, are they at least shouting out who the creator was?
[0:53:47] ChewyChio: as both a vtuber and an artist I agree, its gotten to the point where people will even complain on the paid ones that its not ENOUGH money
[0:54:04] RNGCannon: My opinion is that if you don't want to make art for free you should just not participate
[0:54:06] Burr11: nobody's putting a gun to people's heads
[0:54:14] virtualoop: then dont participate bro
[0:54:16] GManx0: She HATES Artist
[0:54:26] ReyJaggy: How do you think most holo artists that work with cover got started? Fan art
[0:54:29] ChewyChio: yeah, like loyal fans will just want to
[0:54:38] ReyJaggy: There are ton fo holo fan artists that started like that
[0:54:38] JonasPolsky: @GManx0 staryuukiSaiyajin
[0:54:52] GManx0: You dont have to do it. They dont have to win money. But The "Feel proud" thing is bleh
[0:54:52] rikkaonline: there might be some point to it when the contest comes from a giant corpo where like they can afford it, and theyre taking advantage of casting a larger net
[0:54:55] Senoquese: idk i feel like they have the right to complain either way. exposure doesnt necessarily mean commissions or donations
[0:55:10] Burr11: as long as they dont SELL it as exposure..
[0:55:12] Senoquese: @rikkaonline ^^^^ agree
[0:55:13] virtualoop: if it's someone on the bigger side of viewership, as long as theyre stating who designed the outfit and giving links to their socials and stuff, that should be enough i think
[0:55:16] Burr11: people should be free to do it out of love
[0:55:18] ChewyChio: oh wow!
[0:55:22] ChewyChio: I love your key visual
[0:55:23] GManx0: Unpaid Nijisanji sure is a good argument
[0:55:24] GrandAM64: POGGIES
[0:55:25] Kitkattack: oooo cool
[0:55:40] Burr11: lol
[0:55:41] MetroIceberg: Hello, Ashton, my favorite Marten!!!
[0:55:52] ReyJaggy: @rikkaonline thats the thing corpos dont want to do that, the talents themselves want to expose more artists

[0:57:10] ReyJaggy: She influences this rage
[0:57:19] crouton_enjoyer: I don't think it's a hot take, I think it's more of two groups fighting over whether or not it's moral to have contests like that
[0:57:25] ChewyChio: shes influencing us RIGHT NOW
[0:57:25] KazooManEvan: yooo hey chat hey ashton
[0:57:30] ReyJaggy: Hi kazoo

[0:57:49] Kitkattack: I mean it's not like "artists" are a monolithic group, they probably fall all over the place on this topic
[0:57:51] KazooManEvan: w tbh

[1:11:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: HAHAH
[1:11:39] GrandAM64: Too bad I hardly post MaxLOL
[1:11:41] 99d9: all seeing eye ashton sees all ashton51Squish
[1:11:52] rikkaonline: (she still hasnt backed up her computer)
[1:11:52] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[1:11:54] vtuberacingcorp: you ever install those drives...
[1:11:57] rikkaonline: somewhere else
[1:11:59] JonasPolsky: back it up! staryuukiPerreo staryuukiPerreo staryuukiPerreo
[1:11:59] Navy_Mongoose: in reverse, duh
[1:12:00] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ashton51Thinky the cloud if you pay for it. or an external
[1:12:03] InsaneLoke: @vtuberacingcorp LOL
[1:12:05] Senoquese: my stomach mm yumy backup nomnomnom
[1:12:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: like icloud backups
[1:12:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Yes
[1:12:28] rikkaonline: somewhere safe if your house burns down
[1:12:37] Burr11: lmao
[1:12:40] Burr11: classic
[1:12:41] vtuberacingcorp: "The 3-2-1 backup strategy simply states that you should have 3 copies of your data (your production data and 2 backup copies) on two different media (disk and tape) with one copy off-site for disaster recovery."
[1:12:45] rikkaonline: ^^
[1:12:45] Kitkattack: there's backups that aren't offsite, maybe another drive
[1:12:56] TheRATifier1: Norton MalwareVirus
[1:12:58] vtuberacingcorp: It _is_ useful to have backups on a separate drive as well.
[1:13:01] rikkaonline: you want a variety
[1:13:01] TheAsterite: were those just restore points?
[1:13:06] Senoquese: you could have your windows get corrupted but still have the backup on disk
[1:13:08] TheAsterite: those arent entirely useless
[1:13:09] mrp0p1nfr3sh: As someone who worked selling norton they had 2 versions. one to backup to their cloud services for a monthly fee. OR to an external but if you fuck up the setup it will self backup like a fucked up ouroboros
[1:13:10] FranzNF: yeah, mostly
[1:13:10] Kitkattack: read 321
[1:13:11] InsaneLoke: ohhhhh one drive
[1:13:14] Kitkattack: what vtuber said
[1:13:15] Navy_Mongoose: it could be neither drive that dies
[1:13:16] rikkaonline: you should be prepared for all possibilities
[1:13:17] vtuberacingcorp: There's many methods of failure Ashton.
[1:13:18] ChewyChio: yeah, sometimes one drive can corrupt
[1:13:19] Burr11: you can have one onsite backup, but another offsite is the best way to be extra sure
[1:13:20] MikeFiro: Computers are complicated and sary D;
[1:13:24] gozuutennoh: just keep a replacement in your house somewhere
[1:13:25] Kitkattack: SCROLL UP NERD
[1:13:26] MikeFiro: Very scary :(
[1:13:32] HashiriyaR32: AYO?!?!?!
[1:13:33] Navy_Mongoose: but if you're backing it up tot he same drive then yeah, doesn't do much
[1:13:50] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You probably fucked up the install and it was self backing up to the drive.
[1:13:52] mrp0p1nfr3sh: It is expensive
[1:13:58] RuiAsaka: hhiii ashhtoon!
[1:13:58] rikkaonline: its cheaper than recreating it from scratch
[1:14:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You should setup a server to VTUBER RACINGS house. lmaoo
[1:14:06] Kitkattack: most reliable solution
[1:14:14] Navy_Mongoose: yum terrabytes of vidya
[1:14:16] vtuberacingcorp: Yeah we still need to get you offsite backup.
[1:14:16] FranzNF: i just do clout backup or physical backup nowadays
[1:14:19] InsaneLoke: "you guys"
[1:14:25] Kitkattack: ashton51Tehe
[1:14:25] FranzNF: cloud*
[1:14:27] rikkaonline: heres the thing though: almost no one has a fully implemented backup solution
[1:14:31] MikeFiro: :0 Saturday Special?
[1:14:34] mrp0p1nfr3sh: clout backup.
[1:14:39] ChewyChio: googledrive
[1:14:45] vtuberacingcorp: We're just gonna get you a backblaze account tbh
[1:14:46] mrp0p1nfr3sh: tell them you got bot followers and thatll save you
[1:14:53] Senoquese: doing a clout backup before posting another artist hot take
[1:15:04] Kitkattack: I should bother my friend about setting up a backup server with me
[1:15:05] Senoquese: LMAO
[1:15:06] rikkaonline: turns out tiktok clout is cheap
[1:15:06] FranzNF: we gonna make Ashton a clout backup on Myspace
[1:15:07] ReyJaggy: you need a manager that we both. chat and you can yell at
[1:15:11] Burr11: sonic backblazing all over shadow
[1:15:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: My favorite doomposting comes from Tiktok store drop shippers knowing their revenue sources are about to die.
[1:15:25] InsaneLoke: true.... #spindash...

[1:16:26] Navy_Mongoose: and you railed us for not liking your noncanon shipping
[1:16:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: we are fine with it. dont lump us in?
[1:16:30] FranzNF: i think pitcrew got used to being mistreated now and they are a bunch of masochists

[1:19:08] vtuberacingcorp: Gonna have a weird twitter drama post about you playing league
[1:19:13] ReyJaggy: amen to that
[1:19:18] InsaneLoke: thats how Overwatch was supposed to be consumed too but they fumbled
[1:19:23] Navy_Mongoose: League feels so lame after 1000 hours of dota
[1:19:28] FranzNF: no yeah if she ever touches that game im doing a post
[1:19:45] GManx0: Arcane Model when
[1:19:46] Senoquese: Fine, since few people asked me in dms and I got mad again. I rage quitted pitcrew and vtuber fanbase ashton51Bork
[1:19:50] Kitkattack: I'm sure that really was the ultimate goal
[1:19:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Kiara played once and started a meme
[1:19:59] mrp0p1nfr3sh: its so good
[1:20:05] vtuberacingcorp: You gotta play DOTA2 the real moba.
[1:20:06] nacko_yo: if she plays league, all our plushtons are gonna get it. and by it. i mean a very strong headpat
[1:20:18] mrp0p1nfr3sh: league is toxic
[1:20:20] JTBun: bro bought so much merch 3 days before
[1:20:20] TheAsterite: pretty based
[1:20:21] HashiriyaR32: wasn't it a trollpost?
[1:20:22] Senoquese: like a week before that post he bought a fuckton of merch so i wonder what happened, does he really hate league that much
[1:20:23] ChewyChio: they were a member of the community for 4 years, its crazy
[1:20:26] ReyJaggy: i wish that post was satire
[1:20:26] GrandAM64: @senoquese om
[1:20:27] HashiriyaR32: copypastaa trollpost
[1:20:28] GManx0: Ashton: "Be Parasocial NOW!"
[1:20:28] mrp0p1nfr3sh: thats the one game that makes sense
[1:20:30] Navy_Mongoose: I will tolerate league, but I will abandon you if you play Overwatch
[1:20:34] ReyJaggy: oh no its not fake
[1:20:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: it was probably one serious person that turned into a copy pasta
[1:20:40] InsaneLoke: nah, i feel like league is a billion times less forgivable than dota
[1:20:40] warwickluvr: no that was not a troll post
[1:20:43] warwickluvr: ppl r a little strange
[1:20:46] FranzNF: oh no, if it's Dota i'm now doing a manifesto

[1:21:04] mrp0p1nfr3sh: DOTA is honestly not bad?
[1:21:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: League is GENUINELY toxic
[1:21:10] InsaneLoke: no one really gaf about dota
[1:21:13] gozuutennoh: i disagree from personal experience
[1:21:14] vtuberacingcorp: DOTA is toxic, but it's very different.
[1:21:22] FranzNF: dota players are the cod players of mobas
[1:21:23] Navy_Mongoose: you can mute dota players
[1:21:30] warwickluvr: @FranzNF ^
[1:21:37] mrp0p1nfr3sh: League players have the sunk cost fallacy with their game. they are like HEY PLAY WHAT I LIKE BECAUSE IVE SPENT 500 DOLLARS ON SKINS SO YOU SHOULD TOO
[1:21:39] vtuberacingcorp: League is genuinely like a toy in comparison. So much easier to pick up.
[1:21:49] GManx0: DOTA Has Lore?
[1:21:57] Senoquese: dota are on their own little corner while league players love to talk about how much they hate league
[1:22:01] Navy_Mongoose: yeah, but nobody cares
[1:22:04] Burr11: just feels like the league hate started as a meme but now people treat it like a scarlet letter ashton51Tehe  it's incredible

[1:24:37] ReyJaggy: those games plots are like nier lore without the games
[1:24:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: BUT bloodhound was always an ENBY no?
[1:24:42] Noworksm: Titanfall 2? ashton51Reversespin
[1:24:49] Senoquese: id have liked that so much more if the video wasnt an advertisement but just a lore drop
[1:24:53] InsaneLoke: @mrp0p1nfr3sh yes from the start
[1:25:00] vtuberacingcorp: tbh competitive multiplayer games are just bad now
[1:25:03] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @InsaneLoke OK thats what i remember.
[1:25:05] vtuberacingcorp: Don't bother with them
[1:25:13] FranzNF: hop on marvel rivals tho
[1:25:21] Burr11: ashton51Tehe
[1:25:22] mrp0p1nfr3sh: HONESTLY i loved how nervous Fuze was to do the rites of marriage.
