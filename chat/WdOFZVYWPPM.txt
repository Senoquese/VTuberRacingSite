[0:41:45] RileyVoorsanger: I might have played I Spy Treasure Hunt more, but this one often saw time out of the jewel case.
[0:42:14] magmonique: well it wasn't tea but her name was pronounced tea-yuh
[0:42:22] RileyVoorsanger: Yeah it's the one where you find pieces of a treasure map and then put them together at the end.

[0:43:16] kitsu_vikra: Awoooo~
[0:44:09] behoimii: nooooooooo the fly D:
[0:44:11] RileyVoorsanger: I actually had the Deluxe version of this game, which I think had a few more game scenarios after you beat the first one.
[0:44:18] demon_dandy: delicious megumi31Wiggly2
[0:44:43] supra_mike: after more research this is literally the only game she's credits as a voice in, everything else is animation
[0:45:04] RileyVoorsanger: There's one thing that I solely but vaguely remember about this game that scarred me as a kid though, and I've never seen it be recreated, if it was true.
[0:45:16] magmonique: come'on paps, you're smiling. papyrus: I AM AND I HATE IT
[0:45:25] mrvacbob: it does sound like she's doing the "anime dub actor" voice
[0:45:27] 0oGooseo0: ooh I see it now!

[0:46:21] 0oGooseo0: I think I have the actual Halloween book that this game is based on
[0:46:32] magmonique: cause everytime i look at them, i always think they're smiling
[0:46:35] RileyVoorsanger: I used to run this game on a pretty slow running Toshiba laptop, and it often slowed down when running off of CD-Roms, so one time when I was like 5 years old, I tried running this game but it wouldn't boot past the name entry screen, and then I remember the game froze, my laptop blue screened, and it played in a screeching loud volume, the fucking shower murder scene music from Psycho.
[0:46:40] supra_mike: @demon_dandy one of her credited roles is Max from the Pokemon movies so
[0:46:50] demon_dandy: OH MAX
[0:47:00] RileyVoorsanger: I don't know how that happened as a kid but I vaguely remember that happening with this game as a kid, and it fucking traumatized me.
[0:47:15] magmonique: a virus?
[0:47:43] demon_dandy: yeah MAYS brother that makes sense @supra_mike ashton51Baby
[0:47:56] supra_mike: yes
[0:48:15] RileyVoorsanger: I don't know how it got a virus if it was off the CD-rom, but... that's just my terrifying childhood memory with this game.
[0:48:21] 0oGooseo0: remember when viruses where just screamers and not ransomware and shitminers?
[0:48:29] mrvacbob: photoshop was pretty similar, it hasn't changed in forever
[0:48:41] supra_mike: 2 hooks, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[0:48:55] RileyVoorsanger: It was scarier than the jumpscare scary face from the scary maze flash game where you drag the cursor around the screen.
[0:49:02] PastaThief911: I had a virus that just popped up with wizard 101 pop ups every 2 minutes or so
[0:49:23] demon_dandy: i remember in primary school the ispy books always got taken out of the library

[2:57:05] supra_mike: I can see that, girls it could be considered Cute bit if your a guy your treated like an idiot
[2:57:23] niertlwal: masking happens more with women because of societal pressure
[2:57:31] honktowndeluxe: I've heard both "women have less severe symptoms" and "nobody really notices/cares if a girl's weird".
[2:57:37] supra_mike: I may be dumb but I'm not an idiot

[3:02:31] Returner7: eh I think like many things, you get better with video games as you play more of a variety over time
[3:02:37] supra_mike: oh btw the vtuber in the mic muted meme earlier is called Yuchi

[3:03:45] Returner7: you reposted you're pinup on tumblr maybe?
[3:03:45] niertlwal: uma delicia
[3:03:48] honktowndeluxe: Without someone like... tutoring you or holding your hand, video games have to be really weird
[3:03:50] supra_mike: I think I'm confusing it with another site my bad
[3:04:00] Kitkattack: oh woah sonic

[3:04:36] honktowndeluxe: I'm imagining someone who thought normal puzzles looked cool, so they buy one and it's like "it's broken? wtf is this"
[3:04:52] demon_dandy: i dont think guinea pigs were in paps
[3:05:17] supra_mike: new guinea pigs?
[3:05:25] honktowndeluxe: Is it intentional there have only been 2-3 levels?

[3:13:00] kitsu_vikra: Resident Evil2 had it
[3:13:06] honktowndeluxe: There were not a lot of isometric shooters
[3:13:19] supra_mike: Zex the alien hunter?
[3:13:22] honktowndeluxe: shareware was what they used to call demos... cause you were intended to share it
[3:14:05] demon_dandy: it is frustrating that you need the time from previous games
[3:14:36] honktowndeluxe: @supra_mike Zax. I only say it because I got a lot of NSFW results with "zex"

[3:15:36] honktowndeluxe: Some people are like... egotistically fragile. To anything in the worst cases
[3:15:50] phatscout: this looks like worse marble blast
[3:15:52] breakerj912: hamsterbonk
[3:15:56] niertlwal: no at general
[3:16:00] honktowndeluxe: You said you were sensitive to criticism?
[3:16:05] Senoquese: not really about having an ego or not but just something your brain screws with especially w autism
[3:16:18] niertlwal: she's got a widdle race queen marble
[3:16:28] Senoquese: sometimes even at your best you just Cannot help think about how maybe that one random person thinks youre fat
[3:16:37] Senoquese: and that happened just because you looked in the mirror and your belly flopped for a single second
[3:16:46] niertlwal: i would simply not perceive myself

[3:17:21] niertlwal: YOU  SHOULD GET FOOD
[3:17:24] niertlwal: LMAO

[3:18:13] honktowndeluxe: Don't worry, if I say anything mean it will be behind your back Kappa
[3:18:13] supra_mike: just know that whenever there may be one person that thinks something negative about you they are outnumbered 100/1 by people who don't care and like you for who you are
[3:18:14] 0oGooseo0: your not
[3:18:21] niertlwal: since nuance is difficult
[3:18:39] Senoquese: saying it is easy but its hard to convince yourself to think of that
[3:18:54] Senoquese: because youre not just fighting yourself but that part of you that DESPERATELY wants to disagree
[3:18:54] niertlwal: LMFAO
[3:19:00] supra_mike: YOU ABSOLUTE 8 BALL
