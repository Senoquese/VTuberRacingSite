[1:01:53] vicstrom: yea the quote was from miyamoto of nintendo
[1:01:58] Sk4lls: yea
[1:02:00] Robert_Brown_: just stopping to write a manga might grate on readers if it happens too often
[1:02:09] souly_ch: he should stick to romcom... 😁
[1:02:12] vicstrom: the tokyo revengers ending made me want to cry and not in a good way
[1:02:15] Robert_Brown_: have you read kaguya?
[1:02:16] Crownvalen: Is the ending that bad?

[1:03:14] Sk4lls: I remember when my friend told me that hated their fav character when it was near the end of
[1:03:15] Crownvalen: I haven't finished oshi no ko the mangas was kinda fun
[1:03:17] souly_ch: i think he was writing off kaguya coattails (?)
[1:03:20] Robert_Brown_: he'd have to give up his pre-written endings perhaps
[1:03:22] vicstrom: the ending to tokyo revengers made me so disappointed bruh
[1:03:38] Robert_Brown_: oshi no ko started before kaguya ended iirc
[1:03:40] demon_dandy: Yeah yeah LOL
[1:03:53] zach_shield: Correct me if Im wrongL Scums wish is NTR The ANime right? I never watched it but thats all I remember about it

[1:04:31] souly_ch: no way; thats internet overdose
[1:04:57] zach_shield: Im sticking with JJK cuz Todos a chad
[1:05:06] Robert_Brown_: well mangaka don't really train to write endings
[1:05:07] souly_ch: 😏 heh.... thats why dungeon meshi's my goat
[1:05:14] djravingdragon: Istg the one piece is gonna be friendship and ik gonna flip out
[1:05:16] vicstrom: i heard that shonen jump has shitty sales compared to the 90s and 2000s
[1:05:19] demon_dandy: Does eds mean memcho?  She was the vtuber or somethin
[1:05:22] vicstrom: that might have something to do with it
[1:05:26] 0NIB0: tatsuki fujimoto
[1:05:38] demon_dandy: Thats what it was LMAO
[1:05:39] Robert_Brown_: maybe they should focus on only writing a manga that's exactly x years long from the start
[1:05:42] zach_shield: I used to love Record of Ragnarok. It was the only manga I bothered reading. Then my fav chara came, and the chapter just felt lazy imo
[1:05:47] Robert_Brown_: and plan things
[1:05:48] Sk4lls: I heard they reworking the ending for demon slayer right?
[1:05:50] Crownvalen: They should probably end the mangas before they become so mainstream
[1:05:52] RycegoZ: Fujimoto is definitely Ashtoncoded
[1:05:55] djravingdragon: Hiatus x Hiatus
[1:05:57] JTBun: the end of CSM part one was good

[1:06:33] demon_dandy: Tbf kaguya sama ending kinda petered out ashton51Wah
[1:06:34] Robert_Brown_: if the ending is too bad it makes me regret buying the volumes :)
[1:06:51] RycegoZ: Platinum End is a perfect example, first half was great but it shit the bed. Still can't believe it was made by the same creators of Death Noe
[1:06:51] Sk4lls: I mean it mostly depends on the story right?
[1:06:57] vicstrom: isn't there a sibling "relationship" in oshi no ko?
[1:07:05] Burr11: DID U GUYS KNO IDOL CULTURE IS EVIL
[1:07:16] Crownvalen: I'm interested because I heard something similar with shingeki no kyojin and I did like how it ended
[1:07:18] Robert_Brown_: Harp on Japan shit perhaps?
[1:07:19] demon_dandy: I feel like the oshi no ko ending was better than it even deserved ICANT
[1:07:24] vicstrom: @RycegoZ i thought platinum end was always shit

[1:10:19] vicstrom: that's not even subtle
[1:10:19] Burr11: tbh i dunno why people are so mad, the premise was never going to end well imo
[1:10:21] crayolands: I want to say the turning point of where it went bad for me was when they suddenly revealed the dad's identity name. At that point it was a race to the end.
[1:10:24] Crownvalen: I figure oshi no ko became big with vtubing since oshi katsu started being well known
[1:10:28] BaneHallowed: I recommend Fire Punch to all my friends. it’s better then Chainsaw man!! ☝️ mumkey2Chud
[1:10:30] vicstrom: they're trying to put him in the worst position possible
