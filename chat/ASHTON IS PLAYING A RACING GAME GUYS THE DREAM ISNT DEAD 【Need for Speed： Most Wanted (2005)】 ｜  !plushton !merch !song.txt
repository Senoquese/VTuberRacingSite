[0:04:02] InsaneLoke: i completely agree
[0:04:09] FranzNF: lukewarm take
[0:04:09] Senoquese: exclusively an american problem ashton51Despair
[0:04:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: You know when trucks were the perfect size?? like 94
[0:04:20] mrp0p1nfr3sh: nope
[0:04:21] InsaneLoke: no
[0:04:24] mrp0p1nfr3sh: they are illegal everywhere else
[0:04:26] InsaneLoke: they are not street legal
[0:04:31] QuesoGumbo: the trucks are fine, but the excessive lift kits are unnecessary
[0:04:42] DavidKatze: protip: if you're sliding like that, hit the nos and it gives you a ton of extra grip because racin magic
[0:04:42] TheAsterite: pickup trucks are illegal in europe?
[0:04:45] rikkaonline: theyre commercial vehicles elsewhere
[0:04:47] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the largest truck you can export globally is the Ford ranger which is a "subcompact" truck in the US
[0:04:55] Navy_Mongoose: but don't you get it? We need big trucks to haul heavy things like, our fatasses to the mcdonalds so we can haul home a big mac
[0:05:03] Noworksm: You don't, but Americans are Americans
[0:05:04] demon_dandy: We call them utes which is funny
[0:05:05] FranzNF: they have a very regulated size limit here so yeah
[0:05:10] rikkaonline: some people in other countries import american trucks, and its always in the way
[0:05:15] mrp0p1nfr3sh: ford F150 and larger you need special permits
[0:05:20] TheAsterite: knowing someone with a big truck is helpful when you're moving or picking up ikea furniture
[0:05:23] InsaneLoke: theres such an art to older pickups, the ones the heights of sedans
[0:05:23] Navy_Mongoose: like Ferd FTeen Hundreds
[0:05:23] TheAsterite: ashton51Tehe
[0:05:26] faizdanyal: Australia also call it Utes. I think.
[0:05:26] zer0hazard: why would you need a F350 in normal use?
[0:05:28] DavidKatze: lorries are tractor trailers
[0:05:29] HashiriyaR32: lorries are the big rigs
[0:05:35] demon_dandy: utes short for utility
[0:05:39] Noworksm: Lorry is the british term, utes' is Aussies
[0:05:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: the FERD EXPLODER SUV isnt legal in da worl
