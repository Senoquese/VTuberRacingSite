[0:35:38] plazynoodles: to put it in perspective
[0:35:38] fromorra: We can hear ya squeakin
[0:35:50] MayuYumemi: Happiness is a much more subtle thing for empaths. You won't notice it compared to negative feelings. It's kinda even in a normal sense. Like you'll always remember negative things easier because they stick harder.
[0:36:31] kawaiicrew4ever: personally i just take the time to remember my friends who've always supported me rather than the randos who dont know you
[0:36:50] MayuYumemi: That is a very very important and good skill to practice
[0:36:50] plazynoodles: it also sounds like intrusive thoughts and i swear by looking at cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to aid with intrusive thoughts
[0:37:10] MayuYumemi: Exactly, plazy

[0:38:32] demon_dandy: The deep trauma moment that that person probably doesnt remember..
[0:38:37] plazynoodles: if you try to be likeable to everyone youll lose yourself in it
[0:38:44] NanaseCain: I think people feel it especially strongly if they've had experience with bullying
[0:39:05] Senoquese: some people will just randomly dislike you but when people like you, theyll always have a reason
[0:39:08] fromorra: I had a similar thing when I found someone on social media I had never met or interacted with who really hated me
[0:39:27] Burr11: One thing that makes me realize judgment isn't as harssh as I expect is when I get so much praise/credit for things that weren't such a big deal to me lol.. I don't think people really analyze things about others that deeply, so you can't take that internal dialogue so seriously
[0:39:34] HarrisonFjord: knowing other people means exposing yourself to them and sometimes that might mean you'll clash with them. It's so hard to accept being judged but a part of loving others means loving yourself - understanding that others might not love you and that doesn't define you. Others might not like you but to withdraw yourself because of that means depriving yourself of the people out there who are kind and loving
[0:39:52] Senoquese: a big part of being neurodivergent is being seen as weird by 90% of the world and having no idea why even if youre not doing anything lol ashton51Tehe
[0:41:23] plazynoodles: baseless negativity on the internet is so scary and common these days
[0:41:41] fromorra: Some chinchillas act badly because they've been mistreated, and some are just jerks
[0:42:02] Burr11: A lot of sour people taking out their frustration on others for their own problems, I just feel sorry for them
[0:42:21] plazynoodles: exposure therapy?? it sucks but ive been there and now im numb to it because i realize the ppl are stupid ashton51Stare

[0:42:38] supra_mike: why is there a boot on your head?
[0:43:20] plazynoodles: i think as a content creator too is you will have tools at your disposal. blocking/muting and curating your community helps
[0:43:40] supra_mike: do the opposite of making people hate you ,  but that may be hard as well
[0:43:51] fromorra: I used to be so afraid of being hated for no reason that I decided to lean into it and be really unlikable so at least there would be a reason
[0:43:56] NanaseCain: I think there could be an argument made for people who are... extreme in their dislike and extreme in their willingness to act on it
[0:44:13] plazynoodles: nod nod you can curate things online no matter who you are. protect your peace
[0:44:15] demon_dandy: I feel investing on  yourself and your own feelings can help with this, doing things for your own sake can help put into perspective why other people might react positively and negatively and help you get over certain barriers
[0:44:44] NanaseCain: like, especially if they end up with information that could actually be used to hurt you
[0:44:49] NanaseCain: granted, it's a very limited subset of people but

[2:07:52] demon_dandy: I think love live is idol in idea but yeah they are not emulating idols
[2:07:56] NanaseCain: to be fair, oshi no ko isn't actually an idol anime
[2:07:57] Navy_Mongoose: rainman?
[2:08:01] Burr11: is she hating on oshi no ko... NotLikeThis
[2:08:04] horribleham: She is going sicko mode
[2:08:14] demon_dandy: I DISAGREE

[2:08:39] JTBun: the shortest question with the biggest response lmao
[2:08:46] Senoquese: yeah i was about to say LMAO
[2:08:55] metaconstruct: diagnosing the idols now
[2:08:57] Senoquese: never expected the idol question to be the most heated one, but i should have remembered how much you love imas ashton51Omega
[2:09:02] Burr11: eh.. to me it's just acknowledging the conflicting feeligns about it
[2:09:03] demon_dandy: I dont think oshi no ko is purely cynical but thats a different place
[2:09:16] Burr11: and pointing out how it could be better
[2:09:19] NanaseCain: it's like clannad but shorter!

[2:11:37] demon_dandy: I feel cg is more that tbh
[2:11:48] ÁÅ´ËÖøÂºüÂºü: ashton51Wibble
[2:12:10] HarrisonFjord: also to everyone watching macross frontier, please also watch macross dyrl!
[2:12:12] NanaseCain: it was born as a mobage so the characters are just standees meant to sell a product
[2:12:19] demon_dandy: Like real struggles about your employment and being an idol and loving up to thhose expectations
[2:12:37] metaconstruct: one day i will get around to watching macross ashton51Kneel

[2:13:33] asilveras: I'd say.... Love Live is a good start for idols, but I am biased

[2:13:37] NanaseCain: U149 seems very uhhhhh targeted
[2:13:41] asilveras: I literally have a shelf with honoka figures

[2:15:02] funnyplanet1: i know very little about idolmaster but god damn! they can design some characters over there
[2:15:04] asilveras: Listen, I just listen to Heavy Rotation all the time
[2:15:15] dax812: Do idol shows have stories or is it just cute idols doing cute things?
[2:15:23] Kitkattack: Snow Halation lives rent free in my head SORRY OK

[2:15:58] dax812: Now im more interested in idolm@ster then ashton51Pog
[2:16:03] demon_dandy: I mean even love live has a story eventually, but i feel ya that its about the ideal of an idol

[2:18:19] dax812: I love learning lore about these kind of things ashton51Wibble
[2:18:21] asilveras: I feel the true Idol experience has to involve concerts, seiyuu shows, and live events, as well as the songs
[2:18:35] asilveras: and to do that you have to go to japan and learn the language
[2:18:41] Returner7: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby

[2:19:20] NanaseCain: okay I guess I was reaching with that one LMAO
[2:19:23] dax812: Also are gacha games basically VNs? I see all these idol games where youre just talking to them but apparently its an app not a VN?? ashton51Tehe
[2:19:29] asilveras: has she mentioned that before? or am I just retreading stuff

[2:20:12] dax812: Oooh like earning special scenes with your favorite character ashton51Bork
[2:20:20] noodsdood69: Doc Marten strikes me as the type of whipper snapper to say "oopsie, I was supposed to give you a vaccine, but instead I gave you morphine. On the plus side, you're in for a fun time! teehee."

[2:22:05] demon_dandy: LMAO atamarama

[2:22:25] Returner7: LMAO!
[2:22:32] dax812: Do I need to know about idol culture to watch Zombieland Saga? ashton51Wibble
[2:22:35] NanaseCain: umamusume would unironically be better as a pure sports series
[2:22:36] Burr11: i mean i really like the songs in uma musume but yeah
[2:22:39] NanaseCain: or franchise
[2:22:39] noodsdood69: "AYO is that a mf HORSE" -uma musume fans
[2:22:40] asilveras: and gawlly, the Rozen Horizen single is such a powerful CD in terms of music. bangers all around
[2:22:41] horribleham: I have a twitter oomfie who writes PARAGRAPHS about the horses.
[2:22:49] asilveras: Yeah, but we need IDOL OUTFITS
[2:22:54] supra_mike: because it's not actually horses it was allowed in places where gambling on horse races was banned
[2:23:01] Burr11: love ZLS

[2:28:14] noodsdood69: my brain keeps forgetting to mention Oshi no Ko, which I just found out has music done by Yoasobi.
[2:28:22] asilveras: K-on is slice of life, but not idol
[2:28:47] demon_dandy: Hmmm
[2:29:32] Burr11: yeah thats a good way of putting it
[2:29:39] demon_dandy: Thats actually a godlike answer
[2:29:43] noodsdood69: Get them to ask if you have a crush on anyone "Yeah you" (If they're not reciprocative) "*Yeah, you?" B)
[2:29:47] asilveras: I think you need to have a conversation about your feelings with them, and let them know what you think you two should do. Like 'should I let these feelings go or do you feel the same'? I feel like something like that would be good
[2:30:22] noodsdood69: HEY! I think you're really cool! I like you a lot! Maybe we can hang out or something
[2:30:37] noodsdood69: it's a child
[2:30:44] demon_dandy: I think yeah making it low pressure and not really making it an all or nothing is good

[2:32:17] HarrisonFjord: just don't be rizzless!
[2:32:27] horribleham: Best way to get them to like you back is to have ashton chuck you at them like a baseball. It works like cupid's arrow.

[2:33:51] Returner7: Eh idk the apps are very different for girls and guys
[2:33:54] asilveras: I'm thinking that dating shouldn't be the goal here. I feel that doing things to be social should be the goal. and if you're not in a place to date, focus on upping what you already have in your life, like hobbies or skills.
[2:33:57] demon_dandy: They clout check you
[2:33:59] asilveras: that's my opinion

[2:34:57] dax812: Don't pay to go on a date cause you're gonna pay when you're on the date
[2:35:30] Burr11: most dating apps are sausage fests so they use bots to keep the guys in it
[2:35:32] mushi_buns: do you have brain worms?
[2:35:32] demon_dandy: Yeah if your burned out you might need to focus on yourself
[2:35:42] NanaseCain: find a hobby, yeah
[2:35:49] Senoquese: i guess its just feeling so lonely that this was their biggest connection?
[2:35:56] Burr11: i got burned out on dating apps too i know that feel
[2:36:00] Navy_Mongoose: my hobby is staying the hell away from all humans

[2:49:41] dax812: she was about to say "treat yourself with more rizz"
[2:49:42] ViolaVespertine: I think repeating statements reinforces the mindset on both yourself and others, and it becomes self-fulfilling
