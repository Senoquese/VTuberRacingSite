[0:32:37] DingusMcBaseball: hl1 and 2 were revolutionary in game storytelling and game physics
[0:32:42] mrp0p1nfr3sh: if you think about it Ashton. The OG DOOM game crawled out of the ocean so you could be cracked at Apex Legends

[0:33:58] Cannonaire: I only played PC games after NES, so Half-Life but no Halo.
[0:33:58] RedOniVA: Are you planning on going through the Hazard Course first or are you jumping in blind?
[0:34:04] TachikomaKURO: Halo is valid... It's the first FPS

[0:34:13] mrvacbob: did you play portal?
[0:34:16] the_ol_regular: Ash was an Xbox girl?
[0:34:20] rikkaonline: someone spend 100k to make her play goldeneye with a n64 controller
[0:34:23] JTBun: @mrvacbob portal doesn't count
[0:34:27] Burr11: i like how you have to specifically categorize every FPS you've played lol
[0:34:30] TachikomaKURO: It's the first console FPS, and playing with controller is as valid
[0:34:31] a_shybot: what about fear? did you play fear? monkaS
[0:34:37] Cannonaire: Portal is very short, but it's a puzzle game.
[0:34:40] 0oGooseo0: Ahh, I'm starting to nod off. I'm going to lay down now, I hope you have fun playing! ashton51Omegalul ashton51Spin ashton51Love ashton51Baby

[0:34:43] Cakemagic: I think portal counts. It's first person, you just shoot portals
[0:34:46] JTBun: FEAR IS SO GOOD
[0:34:48] RedOniVA: F.E.A.R is a horror FPS
[0:34:48] Burr11: "it was the first story based, non controller, PC FPS game not on Origin i played"
[0:34:49] a_shybot: OH GOD!!!! NotLikeThis
[0:34:54] the_ol_regular: Portal is about as short as an algebra final
[0:34:57] TachikomaKURO: Oh, I fact, you can now play this with a controller to with the 25th anniversary patch
[0:35:01] TachikomaKURO: Halo
[0:35:02] a_shybot: IM SO OLD!!!!
[0:35:03] rikkaonline: FEAR is great
[0:35:05] the_ol_regular: Aka, very long when you try to use your brain
[0:35:05] mrp0p1nfr3sh: this last halflife update added controller support
[0:35:05] Kitkattack: mouse and keeb for sure
[0:35:06] horribleham: Ashton have you played Scrungle's Adventure: 4? Best fps
[0:35:11] BearerOfPeas: i played it with keyboard
[0:35:12] Returner7: again, Half Life really amped up the cinematic aspect of modern FPS, prior to it there weren't really any cutscenes in FPS
[0:35:15] ReyJaggy: Goldeneye 64m
[0:35:16] ReyJaggy: ?
[0:35:18] Kitkattack: Fear is holds up great

[0:35:30] shaddydeevy98: My favorite half life meme renthe scientitst memes
[0:35:31] RedOniVA: This game didn't have controller support on PC at the time... I mean, on the PS2 port you sorta had to use a controller
[0:35:31] Cannonaire: @Returner7 Jedi Knight would like a word
[0:35:34] the_ol_regular: Fuck. Everything. And. Run
[0:35:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Half life is the first "modern" FPS that uses modern style controls on the keyboard
[0:35:47] Burr11: FPSes before half life were just like "kill everything, there is no story"
[0:35:49] TachikomaKURO: But admittedly, the first good FPS for a console... Is Goldeneye
[0:35:53] JTBun: @a_shybot the spiritual Successor to it Trepang 2 is great too
[0:35:56] Senoquese: just the fact that half life had continuous levels instead of cutting to stats screens after every chapter was a revolution ashton51Tehe
[0:36:02] Cakemagic: they're waiting for you, ashton. in the test chamberrrrrrr
[0:36:02] Kitkattack: it's just their sound bytes there's nothing else to it
