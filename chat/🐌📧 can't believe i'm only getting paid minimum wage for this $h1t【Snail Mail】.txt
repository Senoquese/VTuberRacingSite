[0:52:39] behoimii: if a mailman somehow makes my dog not bark maybe i will think of tipping keroke12Sip
[0:52:45] phatscout: in 2d sonic you go right
[0:52:50] phatscout: in 3d, you mostly go forward
[0:52:51] SpaceyBat_: This could totally be special stage in a Sonic game
[0:52:51] BudderZilla: Nope
[0:52:54] Kitkattack: I never got the series either,
[0:52:55] Navy_Mongoose: I never liked the 3d sonics
[0:53:06] BudderZilla: just remembered the the movie about snails racing called Turbo
[0:53:08] Playmer: They both do longform reviews of stuff, but with different perspectives. Noah tends to give an overview of a franchise, whereas Tim will go into the history of how they happened and how they relate to his life.
[0:53:10] Kitkattack: did play a good bit of sonic heroes as a kid
[0:53:16] phatscout: can you do a mctwist off those ramps?

[0:54:10] phatscout: you probably would tho
[0:54:13] Playmer: Doesn't getting hurt make you faster?
[0:54:25] mushi_buns: tim rogers is baby girl fr
[0:54:28] worldninjagaia: Ash, I know an old school game that might be fun
[0:54:33] demon_dandy: I appreciate the bowling alley aesthetic
[0:54:37] JTBun: sonic mania literally made by modders who love sonic games, and made the best official game to date
[0:54:42] Playmer: gotta watch the video
[0:54:50] Navy_Mongoose: usually speedruns start the instand you leave the main menu and start playing
[0:54:57] phatscout: the TokiMemo vid having Ayako say the "BINGO" from Smash TV threw me for a loop
[0:54:58] worldninjagaia: Have you heard of FATE? Not the animw games
[0:55:02] mushi_buns: yes that tim orz
[0:55:03] behoimii: will the run count if it's not a legitimate version of the game?
[0:55:06] phatscout: cuz I played a ton of Smash TV on the midway PS2 collection
[0:55:18] phatscout: and I was like "FUCK I KNEW THAT BINGO" but couldn't quite figure out it
[0:55:31] worldninjagaia: FATE was a series of dungeon crawlers by Wild Tangent for pc back in the nid 2000s
[0:55:46] phatscout: jeez Wild Tangent
[0:55:52] JTBun: pull a Billy Mitchel
[0:55:52] Senoquese: laughing rn thinkin about the speedrun dot com mods trying to verify the snail mail version while listening to ashton's batshit insane rants
[0:55:58] phatscout: I'm 80% sure this was on Wild Tangent probably
[0:56:02] germanidolgod: I think I remember it being on my old Windows XP desktop. I can't remember playing it that mvch back then
[0:56:04] worldninjagaia: It was
[0:56:09] worldninjagaia: Now its on Steam
[0:56:16] worldninjagaia: All 4 FATE games are there
[0:56:21] JTBun: yes
[0:56:23] lolamortem: This game is so mesmerizing, I'm remembering why I played it so much as a kid ashton51Omegalul
[0:56:24] germanidolgod: 100%
[0:56:24] phatscout: absolutley
[0:56:26] Navy_Mongoose: FATE is the game I keep thinking about but always forget the name of

[0:56:31] phatscout: there's tons of shovelware on steam
[0:56:35] Navy_Mongoose: prety sure FATE was freeware when it came out
[0:56:37] worldninjagaia: They're actually pretty good series
[0:56:52] Navy_Mongoose: it's curated shovelware
[0:56:56] Senoquese: i mean, maybe now that flash is dead it could get some sales
[0:57:00] horribleham: Back! Oh cool, they made a turbo videogame? ashton51Baby
[0:57:01] phatscout: i mean isn't that just Game Pass
[0:57:02] worldninjagaia: Its actually on sale actually
[0:57:09] Kitkattack: this makes me want to play that crazy flash game on coolmath games where you jump on the walls
[0:57:21] phatscout: @horribleham no this is not related to the Ryan Reynolds snail movie
[0:57:26] worldninjagaia: I got the first 3 for less than $10
[0:57:27] lolamortem: @Navy_Mongoose It came as a demo on some pcs but wildtangent had this whole token system you had to pay into to play the full version

[0:58:17] Navy_Mongoose: @lolamortem I see. My friend had the demo then
[0:58:22] worldninjagaia: Last I checked, it was on sale for 79 cents
[0:58:26] germanidolgod: Blasterball 2 remix anyone?
[0:58:30] vtuberacingcorp: oh no I'm going to have to try to get another dang game working _during_ a stream
[0:58:49] worldninjagaia: FATE
[0:58:54] Navy_Mongoose: call me crazy but I think FATE  was the first hack n slash with a pet/courier system
[0:58:54] cakeswindle: Wow ashton did the voice acting for this game?? So talented
[0:58:55] worldninjagaia: Namely the first game
[0:58:56] lolamortem: Fate was such a fun game I had to get it on steam to get that nostalgia fix
[0:59:02] Navy_Mongoose: first one I played at least
[0:59:07] Senoquese: its ok im sure ashy is a big big girl and will know how to make them work this time
[0:59:09] demon_dandy: Chicken invaders 2 ashton51Baby
[0:59:27] Playmer: I bet you really want to play Alan Wake
[0:59:31] SpaceyBat_: I remember the first chicken invaders on Windows and I can't find it anywhere
[0:59:33] worldninjagaia: My siblings and I literally fought for the pc to play FATE years ago
[0:59:37] demon_dandy: LMAO playmer

[1:00:10] PastaThief911: There was this puzzle shovel game called "Maui Wowee" I had as a kid with stolen club penguin Cafe music in it
[1:00:45] Senoquese: windows does have a virtual machine built in for that purpose but i feel thats too much effort for you lol
[1:00:46] phatscout: this is just Tempest 2000 but like without the knockoff Prodigy soundtrack
[1:00:54] worldninjagaia: Apparently FATE was downloaded over 4 million times
[1:00:56] demon_dandy: Shes gettin the wr forreal ashton51Tensai
[1:01:30] phatscout: I thought you said you had a trackball?
[1:01:32] Senoquese: were you also at consistent 60fps or whatever this is lol
[1:01:40] phatscout: did you have a TRACKBALL or a TRACKPAD?
[1:01:44] phatscout: cuz those are NOT the same thing
[1:02:01] worldninjagaia: How about a non shovelware game? Just about all the Fallout games are on steam
[1:02:09] Senoquese: no no her trackpad had a ball inside ashton51Heh
[1:02:10] demon_dandy: She deballed her mouse zurafrSad

[1:03:00] Playmer: But we call it a nipple
[1:03:03] kawaiicrew4ever: thinkpad gaming
[1:03:06] Senoquese: NIPPLE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN CLIT
[1:03:08] gasterundertale1: AYOO
[1:03:11] lolamortem: I thought is was so dumb when companies stopped putting them on paltops
[1:03:16] Kitkattack: it's just called a "pointer"
[1:03:31] Navy_Mongoose: I always thought those were weird
[1:03:31] demon_dandy: I hated that thing LMAO
[1:03:32] Playmer: I mean I fucking loved my trackpoint
[1:03:35] Kitkattack: I actually enjoyed them for the laptops at my school
[1:04:07] JTBun: ashton51Stare
[1:04:09] demon_dandy: LMAO
[1:04:10] Senoquese: who the fuck let her cook
[1:04:10] JTBun: what did you say
[1:04:13] Playmer: Imma head out and end myself
[1:04:15] Kitkattack: it's called surf maps Ashi
[1:04:21] JTBun: ^
[1:04:22] Navy_Mongoose: so TF2?
[1:04:23] JTBun: true
[1:04:26] demon_dandy: Calm down chat, its not worth it ashton51Tensai
[1:04:33] phatscout: ok that one twitter take that went viral about fps movement using Overwatch as an example pissed me off
[1:04:53] phatscout: like fps capital M Movement is fucking Quake, and Titanfall, and Ultrakill
[1:05:01] phatscout: not diet watered down lucio
[1:05:02] demon_dandy: When you said movement tech like overwatch ashton51Tehe
[1:05:10] horribleham: I love it when ashton pops off
[1:05:10] Senoquese: who gonna teach her how to surf in csgo
[1:05:19] kawaiicrew4ever: the movement vid of lucio got me so heated
[1:05:24] horribleham: Yes queen, give us the hot takes
[1:05:30] kawaiicrew4ever: NAHH NOT LEAFY
[1:05:34] kawaiicrew4ever: ya that's csgo surfing
[1:05:34] JTBun: yes
[1:05:38] JTBun: that is surfing
[1:05:41] demon_dandy: Thats csgo surf
[1:05:42] lolamortem: csgo surfing I think
[1:05:44] Senoquese: yeah its in most source games like csgo and tf2
[1:05:49] Kitkattack: it pisses me off so much that my one friend always plays fps games with a controller on his PC ashton51ste
[1:05:52] JTBun: it was figured out way back
[1:05:53] Kitkattack: ashton51Steer
[1:05:57] kawaiicrew4ever: movement players find a way
[1:06:04] JTBun: back in 1.6
[1:06:08] Senoquese: it was a glitch back in cs 1.6
[1:06:13] Kitkattack: like mouse is the only way to fps
[1:06:19] JTBun: it's the engine
[1:06:21] Navy_Mongoose: Let's just say Overwatch movement mechanics are nothing in comparison to Source games or Quake
[1:06:22] vtuberacingcorp: Source(the engine)  has a lineage of broken movement due in part to it's history as a fork of IdTech 2
[1:06:22] worldninjagaia: Talk about snail mail to the extreme
[1:06:23] germanidolgod: Source is the engine they are made on
[1:06:23] Kitkattack: it's the engine of half life
[1:06:31] Navy_Mongoose: Source is the engine that runs TF2, CSGO, and DOTA
[1:06:31] demon_dandy: Valve games are made in source engine (like unreal engine)
[1:06:33] phatscout: Source engine is the engine Valve made
[1:06:37] phatscout: and uses for their games
[1:06:45] kawaiicrew4ever: source is a game engine that runs on havok physics
[1:06:49] kawaiicrew4ever: source 2 boutta go crazy
[1:06:55] phatscout: its based on the Quake engine so Quake 1/TF2/CS have a shared history of movement tech
[1:07:02] kawaiicrew4ever: source 2's been out, but csgo's finally getting it
[1:07:08] vtuberacingcorp: Source 2 has been out for like 7 years
[1:07:15] germanidolgod: So...Heavy update when
[1:07:29] Senoquese: not source 2 with pc fps support tho which is the big deal imo
[1:07:29] worldninjagaia: Heavy now lay egg
[1:07:33] phatscout: @vtuberacingcorp Source is based on GldSrc which is based on Quake 1, which was id Tech 1 right?
[1:07:37] JTBun: Titanfall 2 and apex are actually made on a heavily modified version of source
[1:07:40] kawaiicrew4ever: @gaiaman87 HUHHH
[1:07:54] ajvark: i remember this on my ipod touch
[1:07:56] Kitkattack: Somebody STop MEh
[1:08:03] phatscout: I feel like "source engine game" also has a cultural meaning
[1:08:08] Navy_Mongoose: They're slugs with daddy issues
[1:08:13] FrostbyteTgressa: Good evening Chilla
[1:08:13] phatscout: like the same set of sounds valve reuses across their games
[1:08:14] vtuberacingcorp: @phatscout Quake is idTech 2, I didn't think I needed to specify the intermediate GoldSrc, but yes.
[1:08:15] lolamortem: this game is so goofy i love it
[1:08:16] horribleham: Seeing this game really helps me understand Ashton's mind.... ashton51Kneel
[1:08:18] phatscout: the mental clank sound
[1:08:18] demon_dandy: Hmmm, i dont remember this part from  Turbo though..
[1:08:24] phatscout: VGUI menus
[1:08:26] Kitkattack: you gotta do it like Jim Carey in The Mask
[1:08:27] Navy_Mongoose: yes
[1:08:29] phatscout: those are "source engine" vibes
[1:08:31] worldninjagaia: You'd be surprised how good some shovelware games are
[1:08:32] Senoquese: oh man im gonna miss the vgui menus
[1:08:44] InsaneLoke: This music is quite catchy
[1:08:49] kawaiicrew4ever: @horribleham the inner machinations of her mind are an enigma...
[1:08:52] phatscout: like the Titanfalls and Apex are based on source but they don't have Source vibes cuz like, no vgui or "those ragdoll sounds"?
[1:08:53] cakeswindle: Is this a rip off off a sonic game??? Becuase this looks like a really good sonic game
[1:09:01] ajvark: @AshtonMarten good evening. just wanna let you know i hear the new "I crave cheese, Leon" meme in your voice
[1:09:15] kawaiicrew4ever: GOOO
[1:09:23] phatscout: the titanfall doc geoff keighly made is uncanny because they actually had vugi menus at one point in development and boy is it weird yet fitting
[1:09:24] InsaneLoke: This is like run, that flash fake
[1:09:26] InsaneLoke: Game
[1:09:27] Senoquese: @ajvark im so glad tiny mouse girls are getting popular again
[1:09:42] Kitkattack: aw I want to pick up a quest so much
[1:09:48] SpaceyBat_: omg I love Mouseley
[1:09:59] SpaceyBat_: Her and Leon have the same energy as Isabelle and Doomguy
[1:09:59] demon_dandy: Why do they call it engine when eng in the hot food but en out the in of out the engine
[1:10:01] Slither54GT3R: snail racing
[1:10:04] InsaneLoke: She has big ears and there’s a line in the game that’s “the big cheese”
[1:10:07] ajvark: I haven't played RE4 but I know Ashley in the original was played by Sandy Cheeks' VA
[1:10:17] JTBun: @demon_dandy ...
[1:10:31] ajvark: @SpaceyBat_ or Milla and Askal
[1:10:35] demon_dandy: Dont pay me any mind ashton51Stare
[1:10:38] InsaneLoke: Yes

[1:11:09] rowanfresh: what about plants vs zombies
[1:11:16] ajvark: btw Ashton you should play Freedom Planet 1 or 2
[1:11:17] InsaneLoke: The other day I’ve accidentally gotten hyperfixated on RE but I still haven’t played any of the games

[1:11:31] horribleham: amaiumCheck

[1:11:45] demon_dandy: Oh thats re 2 lmao
[1:11:45] mushi_buns: mr X?? lmao
[1:11:50] cakeswindle: Okay that's true but they act like regular zombies
[1:11:51] Navy_Mongoose: Not really, Resi zombies tend to have weird mutations
[1:11:57] JTBun: not really a spoiler
[1:12:05] Senoquese: the games are decades old so its fine

[1:18:27] demon_dandy: she fistpumps when you get a headshot, so moe
[1:18:29] cakeswindle: RE4 was like that trope: the game
[1:18:35] Navy_Mongoose: she's always screaming for help, I don't remember her screaming for Leon getting hurt
[1:18:46] ajvark: yeah probably chunk by chunk

[1:35:26] Navy_Mongoose: man I feel old
[1:35:49] Senoquese: ""I've fallen, and I can't get up!" is a catchphrase of the late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture based upon a line from a United States-based television commercial."

[1:37:28] Playmer: ain't never heard of no radio
[1:37:34] Senoquese: it had tiny men inside it that would come out and scream
[1:37:50] KyuuAA: Old people need help?  They just push the button
[1:38:00] Kitkattack: there are old school back up sump systems where the high water alarm would be hooked up to your phone line

[1:39:40] barfchan: i think it was like proto-sms with less data
[1:39:42] FrostbyteTgressa: I didn't start using the internet until the early 2000s

[1:51:20] vtuberacingcorp: having played it, I would likely have a ton of trouble
[1:51:23] Kitkattack: looks annoying not hard

[1:51:41] Kitkattack: makes me go crosseyed
[1:51:45] TheAsterite: it's like jump king, but you never stop moving cause you're on a pogo stick
[1:52:29] Navy_Mongoose: what
[1:52:34] Senoquese: we really were recommending ash to play hades when shes struggling with snail mail (2004 video game)...

[1:57:46] fromorra: Can't argue with the math
[1:57:53] TheAsterite: i was so hype for spore when it was announced pahichSad
[1:58:07] Zerorush: Playing Donkey Kong Country as a kid when it first came out felt like you were playing Skyrim lmao
[1:58:09] TheAsterite: you were supposed to be able to build an underwater species if you wanted to

[1:58:37] horribleham: Noooooooo!

[1:59:09] Zerorush: I wanna play this in VR
[1:59:12] vtuberacingcorp: @Senoquese Valve were quaking in their fuckin boots over this
[1:59:14] TheAsterite: yeah, if you go back to the first spore announcements
[1:59:23] Zerorush: First person perspective
[1:59:24] TheAsterite: they were teasing a lot of cool stuff
[1:59:29] germanidolgod: So this is why we never got HL3
[1:59:35] Senoquese: that coincidence is so fucking funny to me i cant believe this competed with hl2
[1:59:36] TheAsterite: race the sun is pretty good in vr

[2:00:05] Kitkattack: race the sun is the dope version of this
[2:00:14] Morgansl: beat saber is absolutely incredible
[2:00:17] Zerorush: The real fun with beat saber is adding your own songs

[2:00:21] demon_dandy: bruh now that you say vr... this makes me think of thumper
[2:00:25] Senoquese: im SO hyped for 3d
[2:00:28] horribleham: oooh, ashton 3d beatsaber?? That would be so cool!
[2:00:49] Kitkattack: imagine Ashi having 3d boin ashton51Steer
[2:01:04] Zerorush: Which, I don’t think you’d be able to live stream custom music unfortunately
[2:01:32] Senoquese: i need to throw projectiles against 3d ashton at very fast speeds

[2:03:02] germanidolgod: Stasi is basically like KGB kind of; so ja I'm askin how bad the system is over here
[2:03:11] fromorra: It honestly seems horrifically cruel to market this to kids lol
[2:03:28] Senoquese: this game would be in the corner of subway surfers gameplay
[2:03:29] Navy_Mongoose: My 8 year old cousin asked if I have any games on my phone, what do?

[2:04:26] Navy_Mongoose: This was yesterday actually, but I realized that no, I only have a PSP emulator on my phone and didn't bring my controller with me to actually use it
[2:04:27] worldninjagaia: Ive heard of a snail mobile game involving fighting demon gods as an evolving snail
[2:04:54] InsaneLoke: This reminds me of worms
[2:05:09] Kitkattack: My little cousin was visiting and it killed me every time he asked in the cutest voice "puedes jugar amongus? ashton51Wibble ashton51Wibble ashton51Wibble "

[2:07:41] TheAsterite: were you old enough to play the lego shockwave games from their website? lol
[2:07:56] Navy_Mongoose: or maybe if he stays on his lane, then don't move the mouse at all?
[2:08:17] Senoquese: @TheAsterite oh my god i LOVED the one where you drove a lego car inside of a store

[2:13:39] mrp0p1nfr3sh: LMAOOO we all got glue trap bald spots
[2:13:40] phatscout: Did Sony own Neopets or something at the time?
[2:13:41] germanidolgod: Like nakedd mole rats
[2:13:49] demon_dandy: bald chilla dies of grief i imagine
[2:13:51] phatscout: like why did Sony go hard in the Neopets paint?
[2:13:54] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They die without fur
[2:14:13] fromorra: I have never fully trusted bald rodents ever since watching From the New World
[2:14:20] Senoquese: im gonna shave so many chinchillas theyll become their own subspecies

[2:18:31] Navy_Mongoose: this is a bargain bin CD-ROM from a pharmacy or a Kohl's

[2:19:30] vtuberacingcorp: maybe when you beat this level you'll be able to first try WR it
[2:19:30] Navy_Mongoose: reminder that RCT was a cereal box game
[2:19:43] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Computer played animal crossing.
[2:20:11] mousycakes: ashton were you ever a fan of jet set radio
[2:20:31] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Its something racist against snails
[2:20:35] phatscout: iirc Mirrors Edge came bundled with like, Schick razors or some shit
[2:20:36] Senoquese: she likes the idea of jet set radio but not the game ashton51Omega
[2:20:37] fromorra: It's some sort of snail swear
[2:20:44] demon_dandy: uhoh TehePelo
[2:20:51] phatscout: also Chex Quest was a cereal box game
[2:20:52] Kitkattack: were any of you unfortunate enough to get one of those 500 in 1 game cd's and get totally scammed?
[2:20:54] JTBun: JSR is pretty clunky
[2:20:56] mousycakes: yes yes!! the aesthetic I totally get that mousyc1Ratto
[2:20:58] Navy_Mongoose: The sequel is easier
[2:21:00] JTBun: JSRF is better
[2:21:02] mrp0p1nfr3sh: So if you guys wanna donate an OG XBOX to ashton so she can stream playing it you should.
[2:21:25] Senoquese: jsrf stream with the ashton mod when ashton51Wibble
[2:21:34] vtuberacingcorp: I actually do plan on giving ashton an xbox
[2:21:36] mousycakes: aaaAA you remind me so much of that colorpop stylistic look, so pretty

[2:22:01] mushi_buns: SPACE CHANNEL 5
[2:22:08] mrp0p1nfr3sh: @vtuberacingcorp GOATED!
[2:22:10] JTBun: JSR doesn't really have much of a plot
[2:22:11] phatscout: JSRF is more of a remix than a sequel
[2:22:14] Senoquese: what plot LOL, just skip it its fine
[2:22:18] Navy_Mongoose: I've never played JSR, but the plot of JSRF makes sense to me
[2:22:29] demon_dandy: jsr plot ashton51Tehe
[2:22:30] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Someone gonna need to give ashton one of those new DUKE controllers that recently got re-released.

[2:23:00] ThatOneNekosune: Vib ribbon has a kick ass tutorial song
[2:23:02] vtuberacingcorp: @phatscout probably not
[2:23:18] phatscout: Ash you might like Crimson Skies
[2:23:27] Navy_Mongoose: Vibri
[2:23:33] phatscout: Brute Force would make a good shovelware stream
[2:23:44] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Chrimson skys is a flight racing game
[2:23:56] phatscout: No it's not a racing game
[2:23:57] mrp0p1nfr3sh: They re-released it.
[2:24:00] Navy_Mongoose: Parappa's timing is a little off

[2:24:10] mrp0p1nfr3sh: project wingman?
[2:24:11] JTBun: war thunder

[2:24:19] mrp0p1nfr3sh: oh yeah they added planes to war thunder
[2:24:30] Senoquese: also i did research this already, space channel 5 modding is dark magic and only like 2 people ever have managed to do it afaik
[2:24:30] vtuberacingcorp: War Thunder is where they leak state secrets
[2:24:31] phatscout: Nah Project Wingman is an ace combat like
[2:24:37] JTBun: the war thunder community loves to leak classified documents
[2:24:48] phatscout: Ace Combat is basically a Mecha anime with planes instead of mechs
[2:25:05] mushi_buns: Ashton if you do play Space Channel 5 do not get the steam version, emulate the ps2 version. the pc port is glitchy as hell
[2:25:06] phatscout: Actually Ash you'd probably be into Ace Combat
[2:25:09] TheAsterite: dcs world is the best
[2:25:12] TheAsterite: mopBad
[2:25:17] phatscout: It's literally Gundam but plane
[2:25:19] JTBun: yes, the war thunder devs have told people in the community to stop posting classified military documents on the forums lmao
[2:25:23] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer ashton51Cheer
[2:25:29] mrp0p1nfr3sh: Theres a soldier going to prison in the UK cuz he settled a dick measuring contest in the war thunder forums by leaking official specs of a current tank used by the UK military. Shit was wild.
[2:25:40] germanidolgod: Damn
[2:26:22] Senoquese: oh jesus i should go to sleep, i have work in a few hours and i got distracted with snail mail LOOOL
