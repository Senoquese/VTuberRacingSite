[0:14:58] caratecaa: RE1 to RE3 are classic survival horror. RE4 onwards are all their own game with their own takes on horror action
[0:15:02] Romblymo: 4 is a very good game for different reasons
[0:15:07] rodetovenaar: Yeah, it's more action-focused
[0:15:07] Returner7: RE4 defined the Third Person Shooter genre for the past 15 years!
[0:15:21] lunkloaf: The whole franchise is all over the place with it's game design.
[0:15:36] rodetovenaar: RE7 kind of went back to basics, but then Village went... nuts

[4:10:27] T33bags: well the thing is you cant trust anyone because if you fuck it up its easier to get frustated at yourself
[4:10:45] rikobutepic: this is the nature of mistakes that you must never fault for, it will only harm you both
[4:10:54] rikkaonline: i think its like you said, you wouldve fucked it up as well. theres always going to be an issue, someone else acting didnt cause that

[4:14:17] TheAsterite: and all they had to do was make a small spring
[4:15:10] TheAsterite: and they overshot their time estimate, and i didn't want to annoy them by calling
[4:15:14] TheAsterite: marimariSweat
[4:16:13] rikkaonline: in my experience with disappointment, often the expert's failure is something i can fix myself, but their work is something i couldnt have done on my own
[4:16:20] anonsama9001: may bee :D
[4:16:53] T33bags: everyone does it its fundamental attribution error when you see someone mess up its because its naturally their fault but if you mess up youre a victim of circumstance
