[2:30:05] demon_dandy: how much longer are ya gonna stream ya think
[2:30:18] behoimii: yeah, marsha should have 2 axes in each side to be more stable
[2:30:25] NextTime000: yeah the one you just looked at there
[2:30:55] Bezvinn: if Marsha had two axes Marsha would become a beyblade
[2:31:01] Bezvinn: i do!
