[0:47:10] the_ol_regular: Loser
[0:47:13] rikkaonline: when everyone had a heavy desktop and crt, you had to stay at the lan all weekend for it to be worth the effort
[0:47:18] UltravioletCombat: I did some multiplayer gaming with roommates when I was in college, so kind of like a LAN party
[0:47:18] Egmanila: mercur122Knife
[0:47:27] BNMotive: used to play Halo1
[0:47:28] UltravioletCombat: We didn't actually LAN, though

[0:47:56] T33bags: LMAO
[0:47:56] BNMotive: it means you plug the pcs yup
[0:47:57] HashiriyaR32: Local Area Network, with multiple PCs
[0:47:58] Bookethead: you bring your computers and hook them up in local network to play games
[0:47:58] Burr11: it means getting a bunch of computers in the same room and yeah hook up all the ethernet together!
[0:47:58] rikkaonline: everyone brings their pc to one place to play games together
[0:48:16] kyle__senpai: You're not supposed to connect to the Internet for an actual LAN party
[0:48:18] cakeswindle: Lol
[0:48:22] HashiriyaR32: oh, it's Access?
[0:48:23] HashiriyaR32: oops
[0:48:23] the_ol_regular: Large Analytical Network
[0:48:24] UltravioletCombat: You have to connect the computers together and maybe do some port setup and such
[0:48:30] kyle__senpai: The idea was to make a LAN so there was no lag
[0:48:31] BNMotive: smack us instead
[0:48:31] Egmanila: Local Animal Net
[0:48:36] UltravioletCombat: @HashiriyaR32 "Access" or "Area," not sure
[0:48:41] BNMotive: purinBaka
[0:48:43] kyle__senpai: Local Access Network

[0:48:55] Burr11: back then if you tried to put all those computers on the internet it would've eaten all the bandwidth
[0:49:00] Burr11: so you just did local
[0:49:05] UltravioletCombat: snuffHrm
[0:49:07] InsaneLoke: lmao
[0:49:10] the_ol_regular: "That's just Craigslist"
[0:49:25] rikkaonline: back in the day, not all devices had continuous internet connections
[0:49:27] JTBun: LAN isn't on the internet, it's a local network
[0:49:36] JTBun: devices connected to each other
[0:49:37] Burr11: the communication doesnt leave the room.. nowadays you'd go out to the internet and connect on a server out there
[0:49:43] cakeswindle: The computers are connected to each other like nintendos
[0:49:45] DingusMcBaseball: i never played meet n fuck craigslist
[0:50:03] the_ol_regular: Yes
[0:50:10] Bookethead: @DingusMcBaseball it was pay to win

[0:50:24] JTBun: wow didn't have lan
[0:50:24] UltravioletCombat: It's Counter-Strike that was more of a LAN game
[0:50:25] squee292: with wow you just played with friends in the same room
[0:50:29] DingusMcBaseball: it was mostly for counter strike and stuff
[0:50:30] rikkaonline: more like for starcraft or halo or counterstrike

[0:50:32] JTBun: Counter Strike
[0:50:36] JTBun: Star craft

[0:54:37] the_femboy_mochi: @桃狸 :3
[0:54:37] 桃狸: Oh I was playing the new cult of the lamb update!
[0:54:38] McDoomington2: When Eli says he hasn't changed one iota, it's because Gordon hasn't.
[0:54:40] Bookethead: 2004 was only 10 years ago
[0:54:53] the_ol_regular: We're all old
[0:54:58] the_femboy_mochi: @Bookethead no?
[0:54:59] UltravioletCombat: Yeah
[0:55:00] McDoomington2: Yes.
[0:55:05] kyle__senpai: @bookethead +10
[0:55:09] Burr11: no its not
[0:55:10] UltravioletCombat: No
[0:55:11] InsaneLoke: thats the implication at the beginning monologue with gman
[0:55:11] DingusMcBaseball: gman put him in stasis for like 20 years in hl1
[0:55:25] the_ol_regular: I still haven't continued Half-Life Alyx
[0:55:29] Burr11: it's just implied
[0:55:39] McDoomington2: It's never actually said in-game, but it's implied, and given the powers G-Man demonstrates at the end of Half-Life 1.
[0:55:45] UltravioletCombat: jolliSip
[0:55:55] cakeswindle: Now YOU are the drink in the vending machine
[0:55:56] Bookethead: I've never played alyx cuz I'm not buying a 1k accessory I'll rarely use
[0:55:57] JTBun: LAMAR
[0:56:00] the_ol_regular: "I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning"
[0:56:09] BNMotive: so Barnie was a teen?
[0:56:13] JTBun: @Bookethead don't gotta have a index to play it
[0:56:19] cakeswindle: ILCHC ❤️
[0:56:23] McDoomington2: Yeah, if you don't take the job.
[0:56:28] Bookethead: @JTBun if you want a good experience you do
[0:56:37] T33bags: no barney is probably like in his 40s
[0:56:38] Burr11: HL Alyx is amazing
[0:56:39] SurroundedByPerverts: Barney was playable in a game set at the same time as the first Half-Life.
[0:56:41] UltravioletCombat: @Bookethead You don't have to pay quite that much, you can buy a Quest (and let Facebook farm you for data) or a Reverb G2 (so long as you don't have an AMD CPU)
[0:56:49] the_femboy_mochi: well i gotta go cutie! have a great day!
[0:56:50] JTBun: @Bookethead ???? I played it on my quest and it was still amazing
[0:56:54] Burr11: i just played it on a Quest3
[0:57:13] McDoomington2: In Half-Life 1 he's 27, and I think he's 28 in Half-Life 2.
[0:57:13] UltravioletCombat: No
[0:57:15] McDoomington2: No.
[0:57:16] Egmanila: No
[0:57:16] HashiriyaR32: No
[0:57:17] the_ol_regular: I'm just borrowing a headset from my friend to play Alyx
[0:57:18] JTBun: there used to be a cat
[0:57:18] DingusMcBaseball: no :)
[0:57:24] the_ol_regular: Also we don't talk about the cat
[0:57:26] StreamElements: Feel the softness of the cuddliest animal on Earth! Get your Ashton Marten dakimakura today and bury yourself in the softest... fur of any VTuber! https://cuddlyoctopus.com/product/ashton-marten/
[0:57:32] UltravioletCombat: The implication is that Kleiner used an actual cat as a test subject and something *bad* happened to it.
[0:57:46] SurroundedByPerverts: We don't talk about Gato.
[0:57:47] McDoomington2: A cat they tested the teleporter on, presumably the cat died.
[0:57:49] Navy_Mongoose: ashton51Dance ashton51Dance ashton51Dance ashton51Dance ashton51Dance
[0:57:52] the_ol_regular: There's an achievement about the cat
[0:57:56] Burr11: much better watching this part without the slideshow ashton51Tehe
[0:57:57] the_ol_regular: Tha gives more insight
[0:58:00] McDoomington2: I think it's a reference to the movie The Fly.
[0:58:01] InsaneLoke: fruit
[0:58:13] cakeswindle: Hahaha the way he pats his head
[0:58:18] ApocalypseSC: aww
[0:58:38] the_ol_regular: Get yourself a headcrab hat like in Death Stranding
[0:58:39] kyle__senpai: Oh wow I forgot, some of the first R34 was of Alyx
[0:58:40] Burr11: just gonna blame my hair loss on my pet headcrab now
[0:58:48] InsaneLoke: it was implied at the start with Gman!
[0:58:54] Bookethead: doesn't it say he's in stasis at the end of HL1?
[0:58:59] UltravioletCombat: Both?
[0:59:00] HashiriyaR32: yeah
[0:59:00] kyle__senpai: That I looked up I mean
[0:59:04] the_ol_regular: grimmi14Bigeyes grimmi14Bigeyes grimmi14Bigeyes grimmi14Bigeyes
[0:59:08] Burr11: yes we keep talking over it lol
[0:59:22] JTBun: Alyx is very cute
[0:59:25] the_ol_regular: "She's kinda cute"
[0:59:26] JTBun: love her
[0:59:30] cakeswindle: So how come you've played this part? Did it brea
[0:59:34] UltravioletCombat: She's aged quite well as a character, IMO
[0:59:35] kyle__senpai: Very mid 00s hair
[0:59:37] HashiriyaR32: charge suit?
[0:59:40] Burr11: not much conditioner in the post apocalypse
[0:59:40] BNMotive: shes black dude
[0:59:53] Burr11: yep
[0:59:55] DingusMcBaseball: she has a headband, it's pretty dark
[0:59:56] JTBun: yes
[0:59:56] UltravioletCombat: Your pixels were melting, yeah, I saw a clip
[0:59:59] Burr11: Eli is her dad
[1:00:02] Bookethead: she's half black iirc
[1:00:05] kyle__senpai: Isn't her mom white?
[1:00:08] Egmanila: Pretty sure conditioner is in short supply during the alien takeover
[1:00:10] the_ol_regular: Ain't She brown?
[1:00:14] McDoomington2: Presumably the year Gordon has aged is because G-Man's been bringing him out of stasis every now and again, with at the very least the Lost Coast demo being canon.
[1:00:22] Bookethead: that's eli on the monitor
[1:00:24] UltravioletCombat: limesNoted
[1:00:37] the_ol_regular: Is Lost Coast canon?
[1:00:42] McDoomington2: Yeah.
[1:00:43] Bookethead: yes
[1:00:45] Burr11: yeah
[1:00:50] Bookethead: he was one of the ones you meet before you go into the test chamber
[1:01:02] BNMotive: CrreamAwk
[1:01:08] UltravioletCombat: Valve retconned things, he's the first scientist you run into after escaping the test chamber, and he opens the retinal scanner to let you out
[1:01:08] the_ol_regular: Cuz I know it was a cut level from the game being repurposed as a demo
[1:01:23] McDoomington2: It's implied he's the one that opens the first retina scanner you encounter after the resonance cascade.
[1:01:34] BNMotive: I dont support Teleportation. to me Teleportation is murder
[1:01:43] the_ol_regular: @ultravioletcombat did the Black Mesa team take that jnto consideration?
[1:01:58] UltravioletCombat: @the_ol_regular Yeah, they made that scientist sound like a younger version of Eli.
[1:02:09] the_ol_regular: @ultravioletcombat even the model?
[1:02:11] kyle__senpai: Don't take it personally, Ash
[1:02:21] UltravioletCombat: @the_ol_regular Yep! Kleiner, too, he's right next to Eli there.
[1:02:41] JTBun: LAMAR NOOOO

[1:03:43] JTBun: YOU ALWAYS STARE AT THE CAMERAS LMAOOO
[1:03:55] UltravioletCombat: @Bookethead Yeah, I don't know why Ashton is having this happen
[1:03:55] InsaneLoke: a technique that modern games should use
[1:03:55] ApocalypseSC: lol
[1:04:04] the_ol_regular: Half-Life 2 audio lag, that's just a source thing really

[1:04:28] UltravioletCombat: I have never had stutters quite like this, I think
[1:04:29] zebrudda: The lag is basically just another character in this game
[1:04:34] McDoomington2: Fun fact: Originally they had an older scientist instead of Kliener more in-line with the original HL1 model, then Kliener's model came along and they decided to use that instead and came up with Dr. Kliener, instead using the model they were originally going to use for a hostage in Counter-Strike.
[1:04:37] DingusMcBaseball: or anytime i played even

[1:10:06] kyle__senpai: Pls dont
[1:10:13] McDoomington2: So fun fact: KEK comes from the old World of Warcraft days, where Horde and Alliance players would have dialogue translated into different languages to prevent players on the other team knowing what they're doing. LOL in Alliance to Horde was "Bur" and Horde to Alliance was "Kek", and it sort of took on a life of it's own.
[1:10:22] ReyJaggy: kek
[1:10:24] UltravioletCombat: Eh, I liked the Glock in HL1 more, it felt more useful in that game
[1:10:27] Burr11: uh oh
[1:10:53] Egmanila: Oh yah, I remember you being kinda disappointed that the Dark Web isn't actually as scary as it sounds
[1:10:56] cakeswindle: @demon_dandy aricatto

[2:43:55] BearerOfPeas: it's like sea motocross
[2:43:56] BNMotive: this part seems fun
[2:43:57] Senoquese: the most common complaint is that driving is boring when you could just be running and shooting
[2:44:00] DatBoiVLC: @kyle__senpai equality ashton51Kneel
[2:44:08] Burr11: oh no
[2:44:09] Senoquese: but yes most people hate the airboat part
[2:44:13] Senoquese: not that i agree
[2:44:18] Kitkattack: yeah the long driving sections get old very quick
[2:44:21] Burr11: just shooting all the time is boring tho
[2:44:26] cakeswindle: It is weird how its the first main part
[2:44:28] BearerOfPeas: it was my favorite part
[2:44:29] Lord_Zelix: mountain dew canal flavor
[2:44:33] AGSYZTEMS: And the music just ends? Aw.
[2:44:37] DatBoiVLC: Chad airboat enjoyer
[2:44:40] BearerOfPeas: ... not that i got very far
[2:44:40] kyle__senpai: Wasn't a huge fan of HL2 at all myself
[2:44:43] DingusMcBaseball: i like the loading sections making it look like the game crashed
[2:44:44] Senoquese: the music ending is a bug they never fixed LOL
[2:44:44] McDoomington2: I like the airboat part, not so much the buggy part.
[2:44:51] Burr11: lmao
[2:44:55] Senoquese: spoilers
[2:44:55] Bookethead: SPOILERS
[2:44:59] DingusMcBaseball: spoilers bro!!
[2:45:05] BNMotive: I would love it if mr Half Life would fall off the boat
[2:45:07] kyle__senpai: Spoilers
[2:45:16] Senoquese: oh 100%
[2:45:27] Burr11: yup half life game are very much a showcase
[2:45:27] kyle__senpai: It really was made as a demo for Source
[2:45:27] TheAsterite: yep
[2:45:29] Senoquese: hl2 was basically just "look at all this cool shit we can do while ALSO telling a story"
[2:45:41] DatBoiVLC: Venom?  Adrenaline momentum???
[2:45:43] Kitkattack: this was super impressive when I was a kid but I replayed a couple years ago it's pretty dam slow paced
[2:45:44] McDoomington2: I mean Half-Life games do generally come with a big tech advancement.
[2:45:48] AGSYZTEMS: Half Life Alyx was for their VR headset
[2:46:19] Burr11: yup you get it ashton51Baby
[2:46:21] DatBoiVLC: Breath of the wild is my favorite Valve game
[2:46:23] kyle__senpai: There hasn't been huge developments in game engines in years
[2:46:34] Burr11: oh no
[2:46:39] kyle__senpai: So there hasn't been much to showcase
[2:46:48] Senoquese: most of the development in hl2 was just working on the engine, and then getting the actual story and game done in the last like few months LMAO
[2:46:54] Baked_Snake: Tears of the Kingdom is my favorite version of GMod
[2:46:56] kyle__senpai: Absolutely. Hard agree.
[2:46:57] BNMotive: @AshtonMarten perhaps this is the reasoning as to why there is no Half Life 3 purinThonk  no new tech
[2:46:57] Burr11: everyone just uses Unreal engine now ashton51Wah
[2:46:58] TheAsterite: like, game engines in general?
[2:47:07] TheAsterite: unreal has some massive developments
[2:47:16] Senoquese: they talk about that a lot in their books
[2:47:20] TheAsterite: it's just unsexy nerdy developments
[2:47:25] Senoquese: they really dont wanna make new games unless theyre a BIG deal
[2:47:28] kyle__senpai: Remember when it was Episode 3?
[2:47:31] BNMotive: COUGHCAPCOMCOUGH*
[2:47:32] BearerOfPeas: there's not a whole lot more you can do. we've been animating individual hairs/blades of grass for years now
[2:47:32] Bookethead: @BNMotive nah that's what alyx was for, no hl3 because huge expectations for the franchise
[2:47:38] Returner7: idk valve made a ton of quick bucks w/ CS skins LMAOOOO
[2:47:39] cakeswindle: Paha finish this game and then say that
[2:47:41] DingusMcBaseball: i won't spoil but half life 3 will PROBABLY happen because of some stuff
[2:47:50] Senoquese: in their book they mentioned how they had like 10 different versions of half life 3 but they were never perfect, so they got cancelled
[2:47:59] TheAsterite: @DingusMcBaseball nah, they'll make hl alyx 2
[2:48:00] kyle__senpai: @senoquese they make so much more money from Steam, why would they ever touch game dev?
[2:48:04] McDoomington2: For Half-Life 1 it was smarter AI, graphics, and characters that actually animated their faces when they talk. HL2 it was more graphics, physics, and story presentations. For Alyx it was VR.
[2:48:05] TheAsterite: pahichHeh
[2:48:05] DatBoiVLC: Half-Life 3 will never happen because the Hat economy is in shambles
[2:48:25] Senoquese: the valve team that makes hat and skins is not the same valve team that makes games, its a huge company
[2:48:40] DatBoiVLC: ashton51Tensai Actually...
[2:48:47] BNMotive: wouldn't it be cool if Lamar would chill with you in your adventures?
[2:48:57] Burr11: moar jumpscare
[2:49:03] BNMotive: OH I HATE THOSE GUYS
[2:49:31] DingusMcBaseball: the weight matters, its physics
[2:49:31] Senoquese: oh no theres a whole ass weight system in this game for the physics
[2:49:32] MikeFiro: Nai~ Nai~ Ashy and pitcrew im sleepy

[2:52:00] Returner7: do they still make those vortigaunt plushies?
[2:52:09] reubyraspberry: we are allies under the same oppressive force ❤️
[2:52:23] Senoquese: this is lore from outside the game but basically killing the nihilanth freed all the vortigaunts
[2:52:31] McDoomington2: I don't think they know where he's been.
[2:52:33] Kitkattack: well clearly it's been a while from the last game

[2:54:55] xKiv: it will be more obvious later what the combine are doing
[2:55:20] McDoomington2: Yeah.
[2:55:23] Kitkattack: Barney said it in the intro
[2:55:26] Burr11: i think the people you're working with mentioned it
[2:55:38] AGSYZTEMS: Ragdoll in games is funny prove me wrong
[2:55:48] Senoquese: theres the music stopping bug again ashton51Tehe thanks valve
[2:55:48] McDoomington2: Granted, this is Eastern Europe. It probably wasn't much better before the Combine came along.

[2:56:18] DatBoiVLC: Tactical explosion bounce
[2:56:26] Bookethead: you shot down a troop carrying pod
[2:56:35] Burr11: not really...
[2:56:37] Kitkattack: I imagine that hurt a lot but I can't see your health
[2:56:52] Senoquese: knowing valve, probably? but not explicitly
[2:57:02] Senoquese: yes
[2:57:06] Kitkattack: the carnage
[2:57:06] McDoomington2: Yes
[2:57:25] Returner7: it's the radio!
[2:57:25] Burr11: i mean anything radioactive could be chernobyl commentary i suppose ashton51Tehe
[2:57:26] StreamElements: Feel the softness of the cuddliest animal on Earth! Get your Ashton Marten dakimakura today and bury yourself in the softest... fur of any VTuber! https://cuddlyoctopus.com/product/ashton-marten/
[2:57:47] Burr11: but i feel like it's not really about that.. it's aliens taking over.. not a nuclear accident
[2:57:58] Returner7: idk OG STALKER was scary as shit ashton51Steer ashton51Steer ashton51Steer
[2:58:04] Senoquese: hl2 had soo many different tones during development so id believe that
[2:58:19] Burr11: fracking wasnt a thing back in HL1
[2:58:21] Burr11: lol
[2:58:24] Kitkattack: fracking?
[2:58:33] kyle__senpai: Wat? Frakking?
[2:58:41] Returner7: yeah I'm not sure fracking was a thing back in the late 90s
[2:58:41] DatBoiVLC: HALF-LIFE 1  is about fractional reserve lending ashton51Tehe
[2:58:43] fixedspectacles2014: What the frack
[2:58:45] BNMotive: using water to push out oil
[2:58:51] BNMotive: its illegal now
[2:59:02] McDoomington2: Fun fact: The reason they chose Eastern Europe was because Victor Antonov, the lead artist, is from Bulgaria.
[2:59:03] Burr11: i mean destroying the environment to get resources is a tale as old as time
[2:59:06] Kitkattack: wtfrack they were harvesting literally everything from the alien world to use
[2:59:11] kyle__senpai: I know, it's just that HL1 was not about fracking at all
[2:59:32] Senoquese: its possible, valve draws inspiration from a lot of stuff
[2:59:39] demon_dandy: I mean the lines can be drawn
[2:59:48] fixedspectacles2014: Isnt half life an interactive documentary
[2:59:51] Burr11: frakcing definitely isnt possible because it wasn't even a term in the news back then
[2:59:54] horribleham: was fracking even a thing back then?
[3:00:02] DingusMcBaseball: damn, you're zooming through this section ash
[3:00:03] Senoquese: oh black mesa really werent the good guys either during hl1 LOL
[3:00:04] kyle__senpai: I don't think fracking was on people's radars back in 1997.
[3:00:05] Senoquese: so youre right
[3:00:08] Burr11: as a 40 year old i feel i can say that definitively
[3:00:11] Burr11: it wasnt
[3:00:18] Bookethead: half life 1 was more heavily influenced by 90s sci-fi from what they said in the documentary
[3:00:23] Senoquese: no i always agreed with you
[3:00:25] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[3:00:34] kyle__senpai: It was def about environmentalism, idk about fracking specifically
[3:00:41] Kitkattack: yeah it's like straight hard sci fi
[3:00:41] DatBoiVLC: "what if starship troopers but at home?"
[3:00:44] T33bags: valve was pretty progressive as a company when they first opened its definitely possible ashton they were a co op for many years when they first opened
[3:00:51] DingusMcBaseball: she's onto something tho, they were taking stuff from Xen iirc
[3:01:01] Bookethead: @kyle__senpai I think you're finding meaning in it because you want it to be about environmentalism more than that actually being the case
[3:01:04] Returner7: lol fracking maybe existed in a prototype capacity in the 90s? it definitely wasn't economical back then
[3:01:14] horribleham: we need to get her to watch Aliens
[3:01:18] BNMotive: have you seen Patlabor 2? I love the theme in that movie
[3:01:34] rikkaonline: fracking was a thing back in the 80s even
[3:01:35] Kitkattack: they also make a lot more mysterious with G-man potentially manipulating everything
[3:01:37] Burr11: back then there was still oil and gas you could get without fracking so it wasnt profitable by comparison
[3:01:45] Returner7: @horribleham yo Aliens is ashton51Pog ashton51Pog ashton51Pog
[3:01:49] Senoquese: yall need to replay half life 1 and listen to every dialogue if yall dont think theres stuff about enviromentalism and invading places
[3:01:51] Senoquese: ashton51Tehe
[3:01:52] kyle__senpai: @bookethead maybe not *about* environmentalism, but it does have some influence
[3:01:57] demon_dandy: The authors lived experiences could influence their art unintentionally
[3:01:59] Burr11: yeah the process existed back then but nobody was arguing about it the way they are today
[3:02:13] shanevallor: ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run ashton51Run

[3:04:12] DatBoiVLC: Can this crow bar crow?
[3:04:36] Kitkattack: heheh
[3:04:49] Returner7: yeah fracking wasn't economical in the late 90s early 00s because there was soo much other cheaper petroleum available back then
[3:05:09] demon_dandy: LMAO
[3:05:19] Senoquese: look around that closed container
[3:05:24] demon_dandy: It does seem odd chat was hung up on fracking ashton51Tehe

[3:11:12] McDoomington2: Fun fact: The massive bomb dropping originally came from a bug during testing. Originally it crashed the game, but the devs liked it so much they toned it down to a reasonable amount and turned it into an attack.
