[1:12:16] GManx0: I mean, that makes sense for her character. She needs to prove she isn’t just a weak bunny. But she SHOULD be wrong in how she deals with it
[1:12:32] InsaneLoke: oh right, what was the reference to the abortion comic
[1:12:58] Red__2: the first movie I felt had the arc where she proved she wasnt a weak bunny a bit weird they continued it
[1:13:15] Kitkattack: ewwwww

[1:13:48] EmkaZRC: Is this loss
[1:13:50] Kitkattack: they wanted to slaughter the knowers
[1:14:07] Senoquese: yeahhh LOLL
[1:14:12] spikebomb5: besides competing writers, i feel modern disney sequels are designed to create adult discussion cuz kids wont care.
[1:14:23] albertomedinafuentes: Accepting that your DNA, forged by 4 billion years of evolution, needs the protection of a traditional relationship goes against the needs of the modern age.

[1:16:28] Returner7: was it engineered to be the so called "second monitor content" ??? I've been hearing that's a thing Netflix has been doing lol
[1:16:34] spikebomb5: if u want movies that are sleek and just work, just watch bad guys 1+2
[1:16:34] InsaneLoke: too many corporate cooks in the artist's kitchen
[1:16:43] Senoquese: @Returner7 this is correct atleast netflix wise
[1:16:52] casio985: hi everynyan
[1:16:57] GManx0: All the articles that go “Gen Z doesnt want romance anymore” feel like a psyop to me

[1:17:03] spikebomb5: i heard kung fu panda 4 was really bad too
[1:17:11] InsaneLoke: ohhh netflix, the netflix world just opened lmfao
[1:17:12] Senoquese: a lot of netflix movies now have framing specifically in the center of the screen with nothing going on at the sides so they can crop it for tiktok
[1:17:15] Returner7: REALLY?!?!?! lol
[1:17:17] Romblymo: Movies also move a lot of content to the center for shorts stuff
[1:17:21] spikebomb5: true, it felt like it was a tv show
[1:17:28] Kitkattack: I totally agreee
[1:17:41] Red__2: theres a few loose ends that are never resolved
[1:17:42] Tails1982: Gotta agree

[1:17:56] Red__2: never learnt or explored rumi's father for one
[1:17:57] InsaneLoke: would you like to go to netflixland
[1:17:58] Returner7: idk about 2nd monitor content for K-pop Demon Hunters, but it was definitely very simple and somewhat sanitized
[1:18:12] Returner7: I feel like they botched the end a bit with the generational trauma plot point
[1:18:52] deafmutelaughing: @Returner7 yeah like her surrogate mom engineered her shame that drove the plot and she just kinda fucked off after one scene
[1:19:04] Returner7: ashton51Baby ashton51Baby ashton51Baby
[1:19:09] CaptainToonimar: I’ll never forgive Paramount for not marketing Transformers One.
[1:19:18] GManx0: Goat, Sony next movie, probably will be about the same quality as K pop but that is actually going to theaters for some reason
[1:19:22] Returner7: @deafmutelaughing ashton51Tehe ashton51Despair
[1:19:24] demon_dandy: they needed lebron in that movie

[1:19:50] Qrockpot: Jinu was also hella old
[1:20:02] GManx0: Storys being flawed can actually make it interesting. something can be polished to be so good that it pleases no one
[1:20:03] Kitkattack: Jinu had no wrap up
[1:20:07] demon_dandy: I wonder if they were just kinda afraid kpop wouldnt get ticket sales

[1:21:14] demon_dandy: what ashton51Despair
[1:21:24] Returner7: yeah... they were very unclear w/ the demon stuff

[1:32:02] Returner7: it can come off as too much tell don't show
[1:32:03] GManx0: The creators
[1:32:06] bonatide: I think you being very in the culture is why you have that take
[1:32:13] Tails1982: They can acknowledge as long as it makes sense for the previous also
[1:32:28] rikkaonline: lol
[1:32:29] GManx0: You are one of those redditors.

[1:33:07] demon_dandy: Calling them stupid for not having your opinion Classic
[1:33:15] Senoquese: these takes are kinda anti redditor
[1:33:25] Senoquese: like redditors would absolutely shit on zootopia for the tropes she likes
[1:33:30] redactedenheim: wait, its better because they move thair tails more?
[1:33:38] Returner7: ashton51Innocent ashton51Innocent ashton51Innocent

[1:34:25] InsaneLoke: they should add, silky ant eater
[1:34:26] Stexen92: good evening
[1:34:35] GManx0: Disney biggest problem is that they dont stand for anything. So they have no core
[1:34:47] Senoquese: they stand for money
[1:34:53] pogotross: @GManx0 WRONG they stand for money
[1:35:16] InsaneLoke: they will make the money anyways
[1:35:25] Senoquese: pandering takes finding the right people with the right knowledge
[1:35:27] GManx0: They pander. They are just bad at it now
[1:35:31] pogotross: surely
[1:35:32] deafmutelaughing: seems like they pander pretty well since the lilo and stitch live action film did blockbusters
[1:35:33] redactedenheim: well the parents pay for the tickets
[1:35:36] HmmHrmHarumph: Clueless
[1:35:37] Romblymo: No it's all pump and dumps nowadays
[1:35:38] Ortintzki: Why try hard when try little do gooder?
[1:35:38] Jasuchin: Disney himself was a furry in the 20s and 30s
[1:35:40] spikebomb5: well yeah but corpos dont care
[1:35:57] StreamElements: Ashton teamed up with a Japanese apparel company to create the 💖Official Pit Crew Bomber Jacket💜! https://favorite-one.co.jp/view/item/000000018552
[1:36:00] GManx0: Did you watch the Defunctland episode ashton?
[1:36:00] Senoquese: why would they pander that hard when they can make a movie that says nothing and make way more money way easier
[1:36:03] CaptainToonimar: effort requires talent and talent requires money
[1:36:04] rikkaonline: shareholders need profit this quarter
[1:36:06] hghway: the nintendo movie slop will have no legacy whatsover but made great money
[1:36:22] spikebomb5: they shit out a movie and it makes almost a billion for low effort
[1:36:28] Romblymo: It kinda reflects the short form disposable content the younger generations consume though in that sense
[1:36:29] InsaneLoke: i mean, those live action adaptations go to show they will make money for putting in 0 effort
[1:36:32] pogotross: @Blaisevtch corporations were a mistake
[1:36:34] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke ^^^^
[1:36:52] Kitkattack: ashton51Sip well that's a pretty awful way to think about it
[1:36:55] Stexen92: if I'm understanding the discussion context... Disney seems to think there's more money to be made from the international markets that are more "conservative" than broadening here in the states
[1:37:16] demon_dandy: Zootopia 2 did do numbers
[1:37:16] Returner7: don't forget your vroom vroom race queen!
[1:37:23] Jasuchin: They had to go and make the effort to be WORSE with Lilo and Stitch!

[1:38:15] CaptainToonimar: Peach has always been strong though
[1:38:19] Kitkattack: I feel like the new one could never stand up
[1:38:23] CaptainToonimar: one hell of a driver too
[1:38:23] pogotross: peepoSad peach should have an IQ of 75
[1:38:30] Returner7: I think Rosalina was always a bit of a girlboss in galaxy
[1:38:41] ArthurWar: I wanna say they struck the right balance in Showtime
[1:38:41] Senoquese: ill be so mad if they make rosalina feisty and not a "speak through actions" character
[1:38:48] fixedspectacles2014: Isn't rosalina pretty much a diety
[1:38:55] Stexen92: Rosalina was a momma bear to the Lumas
[1:38:56] spikebomb5: fan of their depictions in the mario comics
[1:39:02] GManx0: Peach in the movie is one step away from going “Pink? Really?”
[1:39:04] Superfroakie82: i watched a dvd barbie movie recently and was surprised how they wrote a female character with strong agency without being girlboss at all
[1:39:18] Senoquese: YEAH!!!!!!!!

[1:41:11] Senoquese: in bowsers fury hes like pissed the fuck off the whole time
[1:41:11] Jasuchin: Mario Tennis on Gamecube, he's an asshole to Luigi when Luigi wins the championship
[1:41:15] GManx0: Mario has no personality. He is Nintendo Mickey mouse. He is not allowed to do anything
[1:41:25] bonatide: Hes literally Italian
[1:41:25] demon_dandy: He did step on luigis yaddas in mario tennis
[1:41:26] InsaneLoke: @Senoquese but hes not mean~!
[1:41:28] GManx0: At least WB fucks around with Bugs sometimes
[1:41:30] InsaneLoke: mario is like goku

[1:41:49] GManx0: Bluey adult Ashton
[1:41:54] Kitkattack: writing is writing
[1:41:58] Superfroakie82: I think the best portrayal of mario's personality is the ending cutscene for mario odyssey
[1:41:58] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: I think he's fine so far
[1:42:00] pingufrend: media can mean something to you
[1:42:08] Romblymo: The kids deserve better than short level slop
[1:42:09] CaptainToonimar: lowkey I’m glad the races haven’t started because my laundry is almost done
[1:42:12] Tails1982: Bluey is cool to watch
[1:42:21] InsaneLoke: i prefer the mean mario from the cartoon where hes obviously like a 40 year old grown ass man
[1:42:27] GManx0: Like you can criticize it, Just dont make it your religion
[1:42:29] deafmutelaughing: @InsaneLoke Lou Albano!

[1:43:20] InsaneLoke: cute....
[1:43:25] Senoquese: @InsaneLoke like mario in my head has never been a cute whimsy perfect dude, most of his adaptations ive seen have him as a grumpy man that reluctantly goes on these adventures
[1:43:27] EmkaZRC: lol
[1:43:31] redactedenheim: yeah, in real life we prefer yandere
[1:43:45] spikebomb5: they used to have respect for kids media

[1:43:53] demon_dandy: Noooo ashton tsundere was charminggg im sure widechilla
[1:43:59] spikebomb5: kids are supposed to be watching sesame street not kids slop

[1:44:27] spikebomb5: yeah especially in the older mario adaptations
[1:44:30] Tails1982: Rescue Rangers
[1:44:32] bonatide: Hes an Italian new Yorker
[1:44:41] Superfroakie82: nah i disagree thats not game mario
[1:44:43] ArthurWar: That's how he is in most of his appearances, bing bing wahoo man
[1:44:43] outrunthewind: Mario is on an extended acid trip
[1:44:43] deafmutelaughing: charles martinet played a huge role in shaping that personality
[1:44:45] EmkaZRC: "bing bing wahoo"
[1:45:03] GManx0: That is not a shock at all
[1:45:06] deafmutelaughing: like he would change the script in mario teaches typing if he thought mario said something too mean

[1:45:47] JTBun: ICANT

[1:46:30] Bamaut: Link belongs with anyone but Zelda
[1:46:36] GManx0: Mipha is RIGHT THERE

[1:51:17] pogotross: om
[1:51:22] ArthurWar: Wasn't that how TotK started, as a DLC, then it grew way beyond that scope so they dropped Champ's Ballad in BotW and then put the rest in TotK
[1:51:25] Kitkattack: there was supposed to be racing? ashton51Modcheck
[1:51:29] Superfroakie82: I liked tears of the kingdom but i did not obtain it with money so eh
[1:51:37] res_ipsa_: They unironically gotta go back to traditional 3D Zeldas. I think they've squeezed everything they can out of the BotW-style of Zelda.
[1:51:39] Senoquese: your title only says 8dx
