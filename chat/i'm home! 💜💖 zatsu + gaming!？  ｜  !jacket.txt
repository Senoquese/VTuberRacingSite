[2:56:38] pogotross: no real downside trying
[2:56:40] Burr11: yeah i think it's worth it if you're hearing that
[2:56:43] demon_dandy: It is surprising, chatting on youtube seems like pulling teeth ashton51Tehe
[2:56:44] DavidPortnov: I feel like I'm already here, might as well stay here. I came over from Dooby and Nimi.
[2:56:48] jdoncena: you are my first sub here. there are many of us who dont watch twitch
[2:56:50] Qrockpot: youtubes got noooo emotes
[2:56:50] Kitkattack: vice versa is just as true, at least the VODS are direct right
[2:56:54] Senoquese: youtube chat is kinda cringe
[2:57:05] dax812: You can't say poopoo peepee on Youtube or post chillaSmug
[2:57:07] olandgren: not being able to !joinrace would be so sad

[2:57:30] dax812: Subbed to one Youtube vtuber and there's like 6 emotes ashton51Omegalul
[2:57:32] demon_dandy: Can we add COMEONN for the chilla races btw
[2:57:35] DavidPortnov: Twitch is heavier on the chat interaction.
[2:57:36] chinfoil: There are no authorized bots on YouTube
[2:57:37] Navy_Mongoose: Youtube's got tons of free emotes, but very limited unique ones
[2:57:38] holomybaby: YouTube feels like an app that doesnt love you, twitch feels like an app that hates you [personal experience]
[2:57:39] Yergos: I downloaded twitch just to watch your streams
[2:57:40] Senoquese: chilla races wont work yeah i only have twitch connected to it
[2:57:41] Burr11: i really don't understand how people have strong opinions on it, i'm fine with either lol

[2:58:42] DatBoiVLC: if you get verified you can do membership immediately if I remember correctly
[2:58:49] jdoncena: it’ll grow
[2:58:51] DavidPortnov: YouTube's system is screwed, so Brand accounts can't get gift subs if that's a mistake someone made way back.
[2:58:53] waffleSupremacyy: waffleSupremacyy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! vod watcher andy finally caught a livestream! i prefer watching vods on YT than Twitch, so livestreaming on YT would be nice for me lol  mariaWink
[2:58:59] pogotross: big channels like to do members only chat to slow things down

[3:31:07] DavidPortnov: We all kind of know the game, let's be honest. Can't really be too shrewd about it. It's kind of a social contract we all get at this point.
[3:31:07] doctor_gamer07: you talking about how big communities = less connectivity reminded me of the Markiplier crying meme, where the context was that he realize that he no longer could be personal with his audience.
[3:31:08] Returner7: don't sell yourself short!
