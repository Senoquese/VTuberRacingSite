[0:41:31] Senoquese: i think its just not your type of game
[0:41:36] TheGoodNamesWereAllTaken: Have you played Hotshot Racing?
[0:41:45] demon_dandy: Half life alyx is pretty spooky good vr
[0:42:05] Playmer: biohazard
[0:42:07] Tallictr: No. Outlast is its own series

[0:43:59] Senoquese: no im saying you probably will get from alyx what you wanted in alien
[0:44:03] the_ol_regular: “Face huggers”
[0:44:06] ApocalypseSC: half life 2 gets a little spooky
[0:44:10] Tallictr: Long story short, the Japanese title of “Biohazard” was in use by a band and a PC game of the same name. US branding teams saw that "Resident Evil" tested well with their target audiences.
[0:44:24] the_ol_regular: Head crabs
[0:44:46] the_ol_regular: @tallictr until Resi 7 came in
[0:44:55] Tallictr: They made "Biohazard" the name of the game before "RE: Village
[0:45:04] demon_dandy: resident evil is a lil cooler to say ashton51Tensai

[0:45:29] the_ol_regular: Tbf I just like how the franchise has 2 names
[0:45:50] ReyJaggy: go go go
[0:45:53] ReyJaggy: LOL
[0:45:54] Senoquese: isolation is very horror-y in the way you have to explore your environment for stuff and puzzles to do, while half life is very straight forward, thats more what youre looking for
[0:45:54] demon_dandy: LMAO
[0:46:27] Tallictr: I like Resident Evil better than Biohazard because it gave me goosebumps as a kid when the voiceover guy said it in the early game openings.
[0:46:30] OomfieChoomfie: it doesnt play like prey
[0:46:37] Senoquese: its not really like prey i think
[0:46:37] ReyJaggy: half life is fun, prey was more simple than alien isolation
[0:46:46] horribleham: they are pretty different
[0:46:51] Gagechamp: Its nothing like prey
[0:46:56] demon_dandy: Maybe since theres more now you can try the other shows ninoegWAVE

[0:47:16] demon_dandy: LMAO
[0:47:18] horribleham: prey has a LOT of systems and builds. It's basically an immersive sim.
[0:47:28] ApocalypseSC: isnt prey pretty simmy like the original deus ex
[0:47:28] Megaket: Streamers opinion is different from mine? Time to scream beribugScream
[0:47:29] OomfieChoomfie: theyre both first person :)
[0:47:33] justcerebro: it's just like prey (2006)
[0:47:41] Senoquese: we loved you a whole lot but... after this prey comparison? its over.
[0:47:48] Kitkattack: they both have a spooky guy ashton51Tehe
[0:47:48] the_ol_regular: Aw shit
[0:47:59] the_ol_regular: Ash gonna get cancelled for her Prey opinions
[0:48:08] the_ol_regular: Yes yes, after I eat
[0:48:09] OomfieChoomfie: its cause when  you say that this is like that people think mechanics first instead of themes i think
[0:48:15] the_ol_regular: In T-Minus 30 minutes
[0:48:18] CharmyBeee: You got this Ashton! peepoHappy
[0:48:36] justcerebro: oh no it's the boss baby problem
[0:48:37] OomfieChoomfie: person who has only seen boss baby meme
[0:48:50] horribleham: Streamer who has only ever played Prey. "Getting a lot of Prey vibes from this game."
[0:48:54] Tallictr: Soma was a pretty good horror game.
[0:48:57] Senoquese: LMAO its literally you
[0:49:04] ReyJaggy: @horribleham i think the puzzles make alien feel more complicated than prey to me
[0:49:20] demon_dandy: What was the last one you said that made people madge ashton51Tehe
[0:49:20] Senoquese: are you sure you didnt just watch alien isolation gameplay while half asleep and thought it was prey
[0:49:25] grandfatigue: crafting isn't scary
[0:49:29] justcerebro: why did they give that one fall guy sex eyes
[0:49:33] DatBoiVLC: !bomb

[0:49:47] Tallictr: Eh. To each their own, Ash.
[0:49:56] the_ol_regular: Ash should play Alien Colonial Marines
[0:50:02] the_ol_regular: ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe ashton51Tehe
[0:50:16] demon_dandy: Its the bad one ashton51Tehe
[0:50:17] horribleham: @rey_jaggy I think it's less about the puzzles. Prey is pretty much like Deus Ex but space horror. And I'd argue that it has more systems to interact with in that sense.

[1:54:47] Sea_Lord_Charles: god this neon is beautiful
[1:54:49] the_ol_regular: You don’t cook a dish without checking the recipe
[1:55:31] Tallictr: I like the idea of a horror game that takes place in the immediate aftermath of a bunch of animatronics (like, hundreds) in a massive Disneyland-eque super theme park gaining sentience and deciding to take over.
[1:55:35] horribleham: I sort of want a bioshock type game set in Walt's fullfilled epcot dream city.
[1:55:49] horribleham: @Tallictr similar braincells lol
[1:56:02] Senoquese: 100% there is something like that on itchio
[1:56:12] Returner7: @horribleham wait, isn't that exactly what bioshock is? just underwater

[1:56:59] horribleham: I want the retro-futurism abandoned city
[1:57:00] Tallictr: But, the reason they decided to turn on people has to be legitimately justified. Like serious people-on-robot abuse kind of revolution.
[1:57:04] Tallictr: Crash Bash

[1:57:31] the_ol_regular: Roblox bad
[1:57:33] Gleil: dragon's dogma is a cool game that is getting a sequel after 10 years
[1:57:39] the_ol_regular: (For legal reasons that’s a joke)
[1:57:48] horribleham: Lethal company is goaded
[1:57:53] horribleham: I tried it out and I loved it
[1:57:58] Sea_Lord_Charles: the invited the soviets for this? wow
[1:58:02] Sea_Lord_Charles: *they
[1:58:06] DatBoiVLC: wait I had a call how far are we in?
[1:58:08] Tallictr: Well, yeah. But most games just gloss over the abuse inflicted on the robots and paint them as ultimate bad guys. It's frustrating to watch it happen over and over.
[1:58:14] BearerOfPeas: to be fair, so were the last three
[1:58:40] mushi_buns: when dose the youtuber jumps into frame to info dump?

[2:01:33] the_ol_regular: Very quick piece of trivia: Did you know Disney wanted to make an animated adaptation of The Snow Queen before Snow White?
[2:01:36] Tallictr: Cookie-cutter culture is just the worst.

[2:03:05] TheAsterite: it's not in the swamp, it is a swamp
[2:03:16] horribleham: Walt should have just built it all underground in the middle of the desert. Clearly nothing could go wrong with this.
[2:03:21] BearerOfPeas: somewhere in the midwest where it's flat
[2:03:21] Sea_Lord_Charles: nah, build Didney world in the UK, its cold here ashton51Omegalul
