[1:26:13] PastaThief911: There's a button you can press to change the way the meter looks to make it easier
[1:26:31] Navy_Mongoose: when you have black smoke you can boost
[1:26:45] anonsama9001: i like how the tires indicate max boost, iirc it was a meter in the original
[1:26:52] statikou: you can boost up to 3 times in one drift
