[3:02:57] Kitkattack: that was an awesome story about how every;one got peer pressured into ordering the funny drink
[3:03:00] bonatide: this is how people get radicalized

[3:03:44] SpiritOfWaterMontaru: Yeah, they have a giant game expo area
[3:03:49] demon_dandy: It is funny your story about the wet pussy you cut it off as "maaan cottontail really got me"

[3:20:48] RezaMaulana98: Aiming is difficult om
[3:21:00] demon_dandy: Oh yeah the thing about helis being animals is that they dont really have any real awareness outside of spotting you and killing you, they wont alert to dead or KO soldiers and are worse about keeping track of you
[3:21:12] Blaisevtch: lmao blund

[3:26:04] demon_dandy: You aimed at him i think LOL
[3:26:53] demon_dandy: If you get KOd in that fight he takes you to a cell and you gotta walk all the way back to the fight ashton51Omegalul
[3:26:56] sausagevt: you can also kill ocelot after the first boss fight with him when he's knocked out, and if you do you get a game over and it tells you you created a time paradox lol
